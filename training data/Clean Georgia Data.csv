While doing so, we must adhere to the federal and state laws guiding the provision of child welfare services. During the 2017 legislative session, there were several laws that impacted child welfare practice and required policy changes: House Bill (HB) 75 amends provisions related to reasonable access to and confidentiality of child neglect and abuse records involving a child fatality or near fatality by adding that any part of a record of the DFCS that includes information provided by law enforcement or prosecution agencies in any pending investigation or prosecution of criminal activity contained within the child abuse, neglect or dependency records may be redacted from such record. HB 86 expands the definition of sexual abuse to include sex trafficking. HB 391 expands safe place for newborns to include fire and police stations; allows a mother to leave her newborn up to 30 days of age (increased from one week) at a safe place without prosecution; and removes the requirement that the mother must provide identifying information. Senate Bill (SB) 168 includes the following additions to: Persons/entities who have reasonable access to child abuse records: Licensed adoption agencies placing a child for adoption; Local and state law enforcement agencies of this state, the Department of Community Supervision, probation officers serving pursuant to Article 6 of Chapter 8 of 29 Title 42, the Department of Corrections, and the Department of Juvenile Justice when such entities, officers, or departments are providing supervision or services to individuals and families to whom the department is also providing services. Such access or release of records shall not be provided when prohibited by federal law or regulation. Access to such records may be provided electronically.Persons/entities who have access to the child abuse registry: Any federal, federally recognized tribal, state, or local governmental entity or any agent of such governmental agencies which is investigating or responding to a report of a case of possible child abuse; Any federal, federally recognized tribal, state, or local governmental entity or any agent of such governmental entities requesting information concerning any prospective foster or adoptive parent or any adult living in the home of the prospective foster or adoptive parent used solely for the purpose of conducting background checks of prospective foster or adoptive parents; Any child-placing agency of this state licensed to place children in foster homes or for adoption requesting information concerning any prospective foster or adoptive parent used solely for the purpose of conducting background checks of foster parents or adoptive parents; Any entity licensed by any other state to place children for adoption which information shall be provided at the discretion of the division and used solely for the purpose of conducting background checks on adoptive parents or prospective adoptive parents.SB 174 includes that the court may order twelve consecutive months (increased from six months) of clean drug screens or the successful completion of a family treatment court, when dependency is found to have resulted from parental substance abuse before returning the child to the parent, guardian or legal custodian.ImplementationThe policy changes are effective upon release of this CWSCL and will be incorporated into the following policy sections in the near future: 2.6 Information Management: Confidentiality/Safeguarding Information 3.6 Intakes: Intakes Involving Safe Place for Newborns 3.9 Intakes: Intakes Involving Sex Trafficking 5.3 Investigations: Making an Investigative Decision 5.7 Investigations: Special Circumstances 17.7 Legal: Dependency Resulting from Substance Abuse and Case Management 19.26 Case Management: Case Management Involving Caregiver Substance Use or Abuse 20.4: Child Protective Services Information System (Child Abuse Registry): Access to the Child Protective Services Information SystemRegional and County Leadership shall provide opportunities for staff to review and discuss the updated policy to support implementation.

DFCS allows youth who reach their 18th birthday in foster care without achieving permanency to participate in the EYSS program to support their successful transition to adulthood. EYSS provides case management services to eligible youth 18-21 years of age to support the achievement of specific goals related to their Written Transitional Living Plan (WTLP). Youth over age 21 are not eligible for EYSS, which includes placement in a foster care setting. Therefore, effective immediately, DFCS has discontinued the request for a waiver from the Division Director for an extension of EYSS for up to six months beyond the youth's 21st birthday as outlined in policy 13.9 Independent Living Program: Extended Youth Support Services.To ensure that youth are successful in their transition from EYSS, the county shall: Conduct transition planning meetings every six months for youth age 18 to 21 and within 90 days of the youth's exit from EYSS in accordance with policy 13.4 Independent Living Program: Transition from Foster Care.NOTE: For youth who have developmental disabilities or are unable to make decisions, coordinate the transition planning meeting on their behalf with the youth's current placement provider, the Georgia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities (DBHDD), Division of Aging/Adult Protective Services (APS), and the DFCS Placement Resources Operations (PRO) Team.Submit a request for resource support to the PROteam@dhs.ga.gov and/or AsklLP@dhs.ga.gov if the county determines that youth who have developmental disabilities or are unable to make decisions on their own behalf have resource needs that may extend beyond their 21st birthday, detailing: The youth history and transitional plan; What resources are needed for the youth to support their transition. In addition to required documentation outlined in policy 13.4 Independent Living Program: Transition from Foster Care provide youth with: A 30-day written notice of discharge; and  Official documentation indicating proof of their period in foster care prior to discharge from foster care at age 18 or EYSS via the Foster Care Verification letter, signed by the County Director or designee. Obtain contact information for the youth (address, phone number, email, social media information, etc.) including at least one emergency contact prior to discharge from foster care at age 18 or EYSS. Advise youth who may need financial assistance to support their transition to successful adulthood that short-term emergency funds may be available post foster care for youth over age 21. Refer to policy 13.11 Independent Living Program: Post Foster Care Resources for procedures on how youth can request emergency funds. NOTE: Short-term emergency funds may be provided based on need and funding availability. Document all transition planning and discharge activities in Georgia SHINES, including the services and supports that have been provided by DFCS, providers and other partner agencies.

As part of that responsibility, DFCS must adhere to state and federal legislation guiding the provision of child welfare services. The enactment of House Bill 993 (2020) has repealed or voided all laws creating and governing the operation of the Child Protective Services Information System (CPSIS)/Child Abuse Registry. Therefore, effective immediately: DFCS will no longer maintain a child abuse registry, therefore substantiated maltreaters in Georgia will not be subject to inclusion on a child abuse registry; and individuals/entities will no longer be able to screen a child abuse registry in Georgia. Chapter 20: Child Protective Services Information System (CPSIS)/Child Abuse Registry: All policy sections and any related forms in this chapter will be removed from the Child Welfare Policy Manual and its provisions, referenced throughout the manual, voided from policy and practice. The following outlines policy and practice changes resulting from the repeal of the CPSIS/Child Abuse Registry:Discussion of CPS Investigation Outcome with Substantiated Maltreaters Discussions of a substantiation determination between DFCS staff and the substantiated maltreater shall no longer include a discussion of the CPSIS/CAR. Instead, substantiated maltreaters shall be informed that they will receive a Notification of Child Protective Services (CPS) Investigation Outcome, which will provide instructions to request a CPS Administrative Review if they want to dispute the investigator's substantiation determination.  The following policies will be updated to reflect the changes implemented by this county letter regarding discussion of the substantiation determination with a substantiated maltreater: Chapter 5: Investigations 5.1 Conducting an Investigation Chapter 6: Special Investigations 6.3 Conducting Special Investigations on DFCS or Child Placing Agency Foster or Adoptive Homes 6.4 Conducting Special Investigations on Foster Care Kinship Placements 6.5 Conducting Special Investigations on Residential or Non-Residential Facilities6.6 Conducting Special Investigations on Public or Private Non-Residential SchoolsNotification of Substantiated Child Abuse The Notification of Child Protective Services Investigations Outcome to substantiated maltreaters will continue to be handled by the State Office Safety Services Section. EXCEPTION: The Notification of Child Protective Services Investigations Outcome to substantiated maltreaters who are minors will continue to be completed by the County Department pending Georgia SHINES enhancements. The following policies will be updated to reflect the changes implemented in this county letter regarding notification of CPS investigation outcome: 5.4 Notification of Child Protective Services (CPS) Investigation Outcome 6.8 Making a Special Investigation Determination 6.9 Notifications in Special InvestigationsAppeal of Substantiated Cases  Previously substantiated maltreaters requested an appeal hearing with the Office of State Administrative Hearings (OSAH) to avoid inclusion on the Child Abuse Registry. With the passage of state law, repealing the Child Abuse Registry, OSAH hearings have ceased. Pursuant to section 106 (b)(2)(B)(xv)(II) of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), states must have a process to hear appeals from substantiated maltreaters who disagree with an official finding of child abuse. In compliance with CAPTA requirements, effective July 1, 2020 substantiated maltreaters may dispute the substantiation against them through current administrative review procedures outlined in policy 5.5 Investigations: Child Protective Services (CPS) Administrative Reviews.Policy 5.5 Investigations: Child Protective Services (CPS) Administrative Reviews will be updated to reflect the changes implemented in this county letter.Child Abuse Registry Screenings Child Protective Services Information System (CPSIS)/Child Abuse Registry (CAR) screenings can no longer be completed with the repeal of the law.

2020-State Legislation: Caregiver Arrangements For Occasional Short-Term Babysitting Of Children In Foster Care,Georgia,Memo,"2023, 2022, 2021, 2020","Group and residential care, Legal process, Services while in care - Other",County Departments of Family and Children Services; DFCS District Directors; DFCS Regional Directors; State Office Staff,"Tom C. Rawlings, Division Director-Georgia Division of Family and Children Services","Purpose The purpose of this Child Welfare Services County Letter (CWSCL) is to announce changes to the Reasonable and Prudent Parenting Standard (RPPS) related to occasional short-term babysitting of children in foster care resulting from state legislation (House Bill 912) effective July 1, 2020. The following are definitions within the legislation that impact the RPPS. Caregivers are defined as foster parents with whom a child in foster care has been placed. Occasional is defined as once per week or less on varying days, and not exceeding twice per month. Short-term is defined as no more than 72 consecutive hours.Discussion The Georgia Division of Family and Children Services (DFCS) is responsible for the safety, permanency, and wellbeing of children served. The goal of the RPPS is to offer children and youth in foster care as ""normal"" a childhood experience as possible. DFCS works in partnership with foster parents to accomplish this goal. Within that partnership, foster parents are empowered to make typical parenting decisions without having to obtain administrative approvals from DFCS or a Child Placing Agency (CPA). Previously, the RPPS required caregivers to notify DFCS/CPA prior to children in DFCS custody participating in overnight activities exceeding two nights. However, the passage of House Bill 912 now authorizes caregivers to arrange occasional short-term babysitting for children placed in their home for up to 72 consecutive hours as long as certain other requirements are met. Caregivers may exercise this authority for purposes such as medical or other health care appointments, grocery or other shopping, personal grooming appointments, special occasions, foster parent training classes, school related meetings, business meetings, adult social gatherings, or an occasional evening event out. Safety is always paramount so caregivers must ensure that their caretaking decisions support all aspects of a child's safety (i.e. physically and emotionally), including when selecting and arranging for babysitters. Babysitters must be at least 18 years of age and able to provide the appropriate level of care for each child left under their supervision. Caregivers shall make all reasonable efforts to provide babysitters with the following before leaving a child for occasional short-term babysitting:Any information about the child's emotional, behavioral, medical and physical condition necessary to provide care for such child during the short-term babysitting period; Any medication that should be administered to such child in foster care during the short-term babysitting period; and Emergency contact information that is valid for the duration of the short-term babysitting period.Lastly, caregivers must notify DFCS/CPA (verbally or in writing) prior to a child in DFCS custody being left under the care and supervision of a babysitter for more than 72 consecutive hours. The notice shall identify who will be serving as the babysitter, where the babysitting will occur (e.g. in the foster home), and when the babysitting period will begin and end. This basic information is needed to monitor compliance with the 72-hour timeframe and for emergency preparedness. Regardless of how the notice is received, it must be documented in the case record. Please note that this change has no impact on DFCS policy regarding paid respite care.ImplementationThis CWSCL is available on the Online Directives Information System (ODIS) at http://odis.dhs.ga.gov/.

Rawlings, Division Director-Georgia Division of Family and Children Services","PurposeThe purpose of this Child Welfare Services Manual Transmittal (CWSMT) is to announce Chapter 22: 10 Kinship in the Child Welfare policy manual. The addition of Chapter 22 supports the agency's implementation of the Kinship Continuum.DiscussionThe Georgia Division of Family and Children Services is responsible for ensuring the safety, permanency and well-being of children served. When children cannot remain safely with their parents, DFCS recognizes that children thrive best with kin (relatives and fictive kin), and through the Kinship Continuum prioritizes kinship caregivers as the preferred and best option for children. This includes the use of voluntary kinship arrangements to prevent children from entering foster care, and kinship foster care placements when children must enter foster care. Research shows that kinship care reduces trauma to the children by maintaining their family connections, traditions, a sense of belonging, and identity. Further, kinship care increases placement stability and permanency for children and creates an opportunity to strengthen the family. The following sections of the Child Welfare policy manual have been created or revised to support DFCS' implementation of the Kinship Continuum.Chapter 22 Kinship 22.0 Introduction to KinshipProvides

The role of a CASA is to provide the court with independent and objective information regarding the status of children involved in dependency cases. The CASA also provides recommendations regarding the best interests of the child. Because the CASA is engaged in assessing and monitoring the childs ongoing needs andstatus while in placement, there will be occasions when foster parents are called upon to provide pertinent information about the child incare. The CASA and the childs foster parent(s) should collaborate as thoughtfully and effectively as possible to advance the best interests of the child, such as:  CASA staff should be included as presenters at local IMPACT training sessions for foster parents  Presidents of local AFPAG groups should make presentations at CASA volunteer meetings  If your CASA volunteer and case manager cannot make the initial visit to your home together, your case manager will coordinate and schedule a CASA meeting with you  Subsequent visits to the foster home and with the child will be made directly by the CASA volunteer  Your CASA volunteer will make monthly face-to-face or telephone contact with the foster parent and/or the child in care.

Because of constraints with these funding streams, it is imperative that SSCMs are good stewards of these funds. Caregivers should be thoroughly assessed to determine their appropriateness as well as the supports they will need to properly care for the child. The familys circumstances should be monitored to ensure continued eligibility for the programs. When it is determined that a caregiver is no longer eligible to receive the financial support provided, the SSCM must act expeditiously to ensure the financial assistance ceases and that any overpayments are repaid.Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF)A federally funded grant program that provides monthly financial assistance to needy families so children may be cared for in their own homes. The caregiver must follow the application procedures established by the agencys Office of Family Independence (OFI) and meet all eligibility requirements, including being a specified relative. Refer to the TANF Policy Manual: Chapter 1300. NOTE: If a caregiver is approved for another subsidy, OFI must be immediately notified to stop TANF payments. A caregiver may only receive one financial subsidy at a time.Food Stamps/Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)A federally funded grant program that provides monthly benefits to low-income households to help pay for the cost of food. The caregiver must complete and submit an application for SNAP to the Office of Family Independence for eligibility review. See Food Stamps Policy Manual: Chapter 3000.Foster Care Per DiemA monthly financial payment received by approved foster family homes for a child in foster care in Georgia. The amount of the per diem is based upon the childs age and changes accordingly. A caregiver may receive the foster care per diem after completing all the requirements for becoming an approved foster family home (see policy 14.0 Resource Development: Introduction to Resource Development).Initial or Annual Clothing AllowanceChildren in DFCS custody are eligible to receive an initial and annual clothing allowance as outlined in the COSTAR Manual.Sibling IncentiveA Sibling Incentive (SI) is paid for each sibling in addition to the per diem, if eligible. To be eligible, the siblings must be placed together in groups of three or more in a foster family home (including kinship foster home). The SI continues as long as the siblings remain together; at least three or more siblings remain in the same foster home; or the sibling group achieves permanency. Refer to the COSTAR Manual for more information.Adoption AssistanceRefer to policy 12.0 Adoption Assistance: Introduction to Adoption Assistance for detailed information on adoption assistance.Supplemental Security Income (SSI)/ Retirement, Survivors, Disability Insurance (RSDI)/ Child SupportAn application must be submitted to the Social Security Administration (SSA) and/or the Division of Child Support Services (DCSS) to become the payee for a child in DFCS custody receiving SSI/RSDI, or child support. DFCS receives the benefit payments while the child is in DFCS custody. The funds are used to meet the childs needs. As subsidy payments and SSI are both federally funded, a child is ineligible to receive funding from both programs. Any DFCS subsidy payment will be reduced dollar for dollar against the SSI. SSI payments may not be sent from DFCS directly to the caregiver (see Field Fiscal Services Administrative Policies and Procedures manual Financial Section II: 2400 Restricted Funds regarding the distribution of SSI funds received on behalf of a child). NOTE: If permanent guardianship is transferred from DFCS to a caregiver, the SSCM notifies the SSA and request that payee responsibility be transferred to the new legal guardian.

Nonetheless, relatives must be thoroughly evaluated to ensure they can provide a safe, stable, and nurturing home for children transitioning out of foster care. DFCS wants to make sure the relatives are physically, financially, and mentally able to provide a permanent home for the child. It is also important to consider the physical and mental condition of the child to assess whether the childs needs can be adequately met with the relatives. DFCS must also consider the ability of the relatives to handle any potential interference from the childs biological parents in the management of the child. This can be challenging with relative adoptions because they may frequently encounter the biological parents at family events and gatherings.Requests to waive pre-service training Requests to waive pre-service training (i.e. IMPACT Family Centered Practice) must relate to a specific relative placement that meets the criteria in requirement 1 of this policy section. Waiver requests will be considered for applicable relative placements on a case-by-case basis. Waiver requests should be submitted in writing to the State Permanency Connection Section Director/Designee.Confirmation Statements Confirmation Statements are statements within the body of the written evaluation confirming that results, documents, or visual inspections (as applicable) were conducted and deemed satisfactory.

Assess how the kinship caregivers are currently maintaining sufficiency. For example, if they are showing an income deficit, ask them about other resources to meet the family needs (e.g., a grandmother or other kin who lives in or out of the home who helps financially) Sleeping Arrangements: Consider flexibility for potential kinship caregivers who may have limited living space which could result in situations such as rooms other than bedrooms being used as sleeping spaces, a child over the age of one sharing a bedroom with an adult, or more than three children sharing a room. The circumstances of each of these situations must be carefully assessed considering the background and history of the children involved.  Pre-service Training [IMPACT Family Centered Practice (FCP)]: Consider flexibility regarding the timeframe in which kinship caregivers must complete pre-service training. If kinship caregivers are unable to complete IMPACT FCP prior to initial approval as a foster home, they may be allowed to complete pre-service training within 120 days after initial approval. NOTE: Other non-safety standards not identified above may be considered for a waiver but must be reviewed and documented in the waiver request. Approval by the Regional Director must be obtained prior to foster home approval.Requests for Waivers Requests for waivers of non-safety standards must be considered on an individual case-by-case basis and should indicate its applicability to a specific child or sibling group. Multiple non-safety standards may be included in one waiver, but each standard must be individually justified. Waivers must be approved (signed and dated) before the kinship caregiver can receive full approval status. The Regional Director/Designee may request a State Office review to help determine the appropriateness of a waiver request. Requests for such a review should be sent to the office of the State Placement and Permanency Director via the state waiver mailbox: dfcs-waivers@dhs.ga.gov. The Regional Director/Designee or CPA Resource Developer/Designee should keep track of approved waivers including each non-safety standard being waived and the date of the approval.Post-Waiver Monitoring After a waiver of a non-safety standard has been approved, the DFCS Caregiver Recruitment and Retention Specialist (CRRS)/CPA Resource Development team must ensure the ongoing monitoring of the home addresses the standard that was waived. This is to ensure no childs safety or well-being is adversely affected and to assess the continued appropriateness of the waiver.IV-E Eligibility A kinship foster home for which a non-safety approval standard is waived will be considered to have full approval status if it satisfies all other approval requirements. Consequently, title IVE eligible placements may be reimbursable through title IVE.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-22-kinship-section-226-waiver-non-safety-standards

A re-evaluation may be completed at any time during an approved homes one year approval period but is usually completed just prior to the expiration of the current approval period. The key purpose of the re-evaluation is to utilize information gathered during the approval term to determine if a home continues to be a safe and suitable environment for the placement of children in foster care and meets Safety and Quality Standards. Information gathered from various sources (e.g., in-home consultation, feedback from caregivers, case managers, children placed in the home, documentation, safety screening, training logs) is used to conduct a holistic review of the caregiver and household.Who is qualified to complete the Family Re-evaluation? SAFE Certified DFCS staff, SAFE Certified CPA Case staff, or contractors may qualify as a SAFE Home Study Practitioner (HSP) able to complete the Family Re-evaluation. Private contractors must meet the following criteria: Certification in the SAFE model; A minimum of a bachelors level of education in Social Work, Counseling, Psychology, or a related field; Ability to understand and implement the philosophy and conceptualizations inherent in pre-service training; A functional understanding of the agencys mission; and Ability to provide thorough, well-written home studies with supported recommendations.Updating a SAFE Home Study Go to www.safehomestudy.org. Select Download Reports. NOTE: In order to download SAFE forms and templates you must have completed the full two-day SAFE training and be a certified SAFE user.  Enter your email address and select validate to receive an email that includes a link. Use the link received via email to access the applicable section of the website. Select the tab labeled Tutorials on the left side of the screen. Select the PowerPoint and PDF for updating a SAFE home studySupplemental Verifications The following documents should be obtained by the HSP during the re-evaluation process: Primary Caregivers: Copy of Drivers License  if they transport foster children Copy of Automobile Insurance  if they own a vehicle and transport foster children Verification of Household Income Proof of current utility paymentProof of current rent/mortgage payment Pet Vaccination RecordImmunization Records for household members under the age of 18 Continued Parent Development Training CertificatesSecondary Caregivers: Copy of Drivers License  if they transport foster children Copy of Automobile Insurance  if they own a vehicle and transport foster children Continued Parent Development Training Certificates Other Adult Household Members Copy of Drivers License  if they transport foster children Copy of Automobile Insurance  if they own a vehicle and transport foster childrenA copy of the following documents may be required if significant events have occurred since the initial family evaluation: Marriage Certificates/Divorce Decrees Death Certificates Water/Sewage Bill/Environmental Statement Verification of Mortgage or Lease Agreement  if the re-evaluation is due to relocation  TB Test Results  (if not completed during medical exam) Proof of Citizenship (e.g., birth certificate, naturalization papers, US Passport, Permanent Resident Alien Form/Green Card) CPR/First Aid CertificationFORMS AND TOOLSCaregiver Child Safety AgreementCaregiver Home Inspection Safety and Compliance ChecklistCaregiver Placement PreferencesConfidentiality and Privacy Standards AgreementConverting a Non-SAFE study to the SAFE FormatFinancial Statement for Resource ParentingFoster or Adoptive Caregiver Annual Re-evaluation Instructions - Adult Household MemberFoster or Adoptive Caregiver Annual Re-evaluation Instructions - Primary CaregiverFoster or Adoptive Caregiver Annual Re-evaluation Instructions - Secondary CaregiverInstructions for Signing Caregiver Forms in Adobe AcrobatNotice of Privacy PracticeNotice of Privacy Practice (Spanish)Primary Caregiver Feedback SurveyProcess Guide for the SAFE Home Study Conversion of Approved Foster and Adoptive Caregivers During Annual Re-evaluationProspective Foster or Adoptive Parent Medical Evaluation ReportSafe Home Study - Resource Center - Download TemplatesSafety and Quality Standards AcknowledgementSecondary Caregiver Feedback Survey",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-22-kinship-section-225-kinship-foster-home-re

The HSP may be a certified DFCS staff member, Child Placing Agency (CPA) staff member or approved contractor. The evaluation process must be supervised throughout by a supervisor who is certified in the SAFE model and has successfully completed the SAFE Supervisor Training. All home study interviews must be conducted in the applicants home.The final approval authority must be a SAFE certified DFCS County Director/Designee or CPA Director/Designee. NOTE: Home studies must be updated for each subsequent adoption. Afford any qualified individual the opportunity to become an adoptive or foster parent without regard to race, color, or national origin of the individual or of the child involved (see policy 14.6 Resource Development: Recruitment and Retention). Afford qualified individuals with disabilities an equal opportunity to participate in or benefit from the DFCS foster care and adoption programs (see policy 14.11 Resource Development: Individualized Assessment). Allow waivers of non-safety approval standards for specific children on a case-by-case basis (see policy 22.6 Kinship: Waiver of Non-Safety Approval Standards for Kinship Foster Homes). Conduct safety screenings on all applicants and their adult household members (age 18 years and older) before the applicants can be finally approved for placement of a child (see policy 19.9 Case Management: Safety Screenings). Conduct a fingerprint-based criminal history records check of the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database on all applicants and their adult household members (age 18 years and older) before the applicants can be finally approved for placement of a child (see policy 19.8 Case Management: Criminal Records Checks (CRC)).Assess the residence of each prospective caregiver to determine if the physical environment meets the DFCS minimum safety and quality standards (see policy 14.1 Resource Development: Safety and Quality Standards (SQS)). Ensure a comprehensive medical evaluation is completed for all applicants and their current household members. The medical evaluation must be conducted and signed by a licensed physician, physicians assistant, or public health department within 12 months of the approval date for the home study (see policy 14.1 Resource Development: Safety and Quality Standards (SQS)). Primary and Secondary Caregivers The medical evaluation must include a screening for Tuberculosis (TB). Caregivers of children age 0 - 24 months must have an up-to-date pertussis (whooping cough) vaccination unless the immunization is contrary to the individuals health as documented by a licensed health care professional. Caregivers of children age 0 - 24 months and children with special medical needs must have an up-to-date annual influenza vaccination unless the immunization is contrary to the individuals health as documented by a licensed health care professional. Document the medical evaluation on the Prospective Foster or Adoptive Parent Medical Evaluation Report. Other household members Household members 18 years of age or older must be screened for TB.Household members under 18 years of age must be current regarding immunizations unless a medical exception applies. Document the medical evaluation on the Other Household Member Medical Evaluation Report. An applicant must be screened out if the certifying medical official indicates that the applicants or other household members health condition poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others. NOTE: When direct threat is the justification for not approving individuals with disabilities, the decision must be based on an individualized assessment (see policy 14.11 Resource Development: Individualized Assessment). Ensure primary and secondary caregivers undergo drug screening within the 12 consecutive months prior to final approval of the home study (see policy 19.25 Case Management: Drug Screens). Obtain character references for each applicant (if not obtained during a preceding Kinship Assessment). Secure references that apply to both members of a married couple. Obtain a reference from each child residing outside of the applicant household. Obtain permission from the applicant prior to contacting their children. If permission is not granted or a child refuses to provide a reference, the reasons must be reviewed with the applicant and addressed in the SAFE Home Study Report. NOTE: Children residing in the applicants home are part of the household being evaluated and do not count as one the required references.Obtain at least three character references: A reference from at least one extended family member not residing in the home of the applicant(s). A reference from an applicants previous or current employer if the applicant is or has been employed in a setting that involves children (e.g. school, childcare facility, group home, etc.).A reference from any prior agency for which an applicant served as a foster or adoptive parent. Obtain additional references if conflicting, ambivalent or inadequate statements are received from those initially requested.Complete the foster home evaluation within 120 calendar days. If a child in a voluntary kinship arrangement prior to entering DFCS custody remains in that same home, then the foster home evaluation is due within 120 days from the date the child entered DFCS custody. If a child is placed with a kinship caregiver after entering DFCS custody, then the foster home evaluation is due within 120 days of the kinship placement. The final approval authority (SAFE certified DFCS County Director/Designee or CPA Director/Designee) has 5 business days to review and make the approval decision, which is part of the 120-day timeframe. Full approval status must not be granted to an applicant prior to the completion of an approved SAFE Home Study. Complete home study requests on families in Georgia (fostering or adopting) from another state in accordance with the Safe and Timely Interstate Placement of Foster Children Act of 2006. The local DFCS must complete and document the evaluation in Georgia SHINES within 45 calendar days of case assignment from the Georgia Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC) Administrator (see policy 15.3 Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children: Placement of Children from Other States into Georgia (Georgia as the Receiving State)). Complete ICPC Regulation 7 (Expedited placement) requests within a 20-day timeframe in accordance with policy 15.4 Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children: Expedited Placements. Provide written notification to applicants regarding their approval status within five business days of the approval decision. Adhere to confidentiality and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in accordance with policy 2.5 Information Management: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and 2.6 Information Management: Confidentiality/Safeguarding Information.PROCEDURESThe Social Services Case Manager (SSCM) will: Inform the kinship caregiver that a Kinship Coordinator will be available to help them work with DFCS Caregiver Recruitment and Retention Specialists (CRRS)/CPA Resource Development (RD) Staff to become an approved foster parent. Discuss the desired permanency plan outcome for the child(ren) in DFCS custody and inform the kinship caregivers of the direction in which the case is moving (e.g. reunification or non-reunification).The Kinship Coordinator will: Notify the Caregiver Recruitment and Retention Specialist (CRRS)/CPA Resource Development (RD) Staff when a kinship caregiver expresses interest in becoming a foster parent and provide RD staff with the demographic and contact information within 30 calendar days of the kinship caregiver expressing interest. Inform the kinship caregiver that the RD staff will contact them to schedule an information session to discuss the process/requirements for becoming a foster parent (see policy 14.7 Resource Development: Inquiries and Information Sessions). Work with the RD staff and kinship caregivers to help facilitate the enrollment of kinship caregivers in pre-service training. Discuss with kinship caregivers other possible financial and non-financial supports available until approval as a foster parent. Ensure kinship caregivers have a clear understanding of the permanency plan for the child(ren) placed in the home or the child(ren) they are seeking to have placed in their home. Maintain ongoing contact with the RD staff and kinship caregiver to facilitate timely completion of the foster home evaluation (see policy 14.10 Resource Development: Initial Family Evaluation). Provide support to all parties involved (Kinship caregivers, SSCM, RD staff, HSP) to help overcome barriers to completion of the foster home evaluation. Monitor the foster home evaluation process and request a staffing (as needed) with the SSCM, RD staff, HSP and SAFE supervisor to address any issues or concerns that appear to be hindering the kinship foster home evaluation from being completed within 120 days. Document all contacts and case activity performed in the Narrative section of the Contact Detail page in Georgia SHINES within 72 hours of occurrence.The DFCS Caregiver Recruitment and Retention Specialist (CRRS)/CPA Resource Development (RD) Staff will: Review any Kinship Assessments completed on kinship caregivers in Georgia SHINES. Gather information from the Kinship Care Assessments that might help expedite the foster home evaluation process. Work in collaboration with the Kinship Coordinator to obtain information that may have already been provided by kinship caregivers to minimize duplication of efforts (e.g. references, supplemental verifications, etc.). Allow applicants 10 business days following receipt to submit the Prospective Caregiver Application and Live Scan Application Form to DFCS (see policy 14.7 Resource Development: Inquiries and Information Sessions). Make an appointment with an Electronic Fingerprint Technician to complete a fingerprint-based criminal history records check of the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database within 10 business days of receiving a completed Live Scan Application form (see policy 19.8 Case Management: Criminal Records Checks (CRC)). NOTE: Applicants will need to provide a copy of their valid drivers license, state issued identification, or other accepted form of identification at this time.Contact applicants to plan a home visit to assess their physical home environment. Explain DFCS obligation to maintain confidentiality and safeguard information to prevent unauthorized disclosure: Personal information provided during the completion of the Kinship Assessment or while serving as a kin caregiver will be kept confidential and used for the purpose of determining their suitability for the care of the child, unless otherwise permitted by law. See policy 2.6 Information Management: Confidentiality/Safeguarding Information.DFCS cannot share protected health information (PHI) with any person, agency or contractor without prior written authorization from the owner of the PHI, unless otherwise permitted by law. Provide a copy of the Notice of Privacy Practices and obtain signature. See policy 2.5 Information Management: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)Obtain any necessary identifying information (i.e. DOB and SSN) on all adult household members that was not previously obtained. Complete required safety screenings and review the results with the SAFE Supervisor prior to the home visit (see policy 19.9 Case Management: Safety Screenings). NOTE: CPA staff may decide to proceed with the home visit prior to receiving screening results from the DFCS Screening Unit. Review the results of the criminal history records checks with the SAFE Supervisor. Document a discussion of negative findings and justification for approval, if granted (see policy 19.8 Case Management: Criminal Records Checks (CRC)).Visit each applicants place of residence and carefully assess the physical environment (e.g. living space, condition of the home). NOTE: This is not a Home Study Interview. Complete the Caregiver Home Inspection Safety and Compliance Checklist. Confirm that the home has essentials such as safe drinking water, proper kitchen and bath facilities, etc.). If a home has a water well, the well needs to be inspected every three years as recommended by the Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH). Water wells also need to comply with the Georgia Water Wells Standard Act of 1985 that indicates the following: The upper terminal of the well shall be protected by a sanitary seal or cover to prevent entrance of pollutants into the well. Negative reports from sampling of the wells without the upgrade can be construed as safe with an advisory that the upper well terminus should be upgraded into compliance as soon as possible. Annual re-testing is required until the well is brought into full compliance with the Act. If a home has a septic tank, the septic tank needs to meet applicable specifications or criteria developed by DPH. Determine the date the tank was last inspected by a septic service professional and the date it was last pumped. If the septic tank has not been pumped within the last four years, consult with DPH to determine if there is a safety threat. Confirm that the home is safe and in a reasonable state of repair. Confirm that living arrangements are clean, safe, and free of hazardous conditions. Take photos of the sleeping areas proposed for children. Complete a water safety assessment on homes that have swimming pools, spas, lakes, etc. and take photos. NOTE: See policy 14.1 Resource Development: Safety and Quality Standards (SQS) for information on home safety standards.Meet with the SAFE Supervisor to discuss the results of the home inspection, safety screenings, and criminal records checks to determine whether the family is eligible to continue the family evaluation process. If all findings are acceptable, invite the applicant to pre-service training and initiate the SAFE Home Study evaluation. Provide applicants the required Caregiver Onboarding Forms and Instructions after they have been determined eligible to attend pre-service training. The instructions and HIPPA Notice of Privacy Practices are theirs to keep, but they must return the accompanying forms and other supplemental verifications with 10 business days. Download the SAFE Questionnaire 1 from the SAFE Home Study website and send to the family along with the Onboarding Forms. The primary caregiver, secondary caregiver, and other adult household members shall be given their own onboarding forms which must be returned. Onboarding documents include: Prospective Caregiver Application HIPPA Notice of Privacy PracticesAuthorization for the Release of Information Caregiver Home Inspection Safety and Compliance Checklist SAFE Questionnaire 1 (Q1)- Primary and Secondary Caregiver Safety and Quality Standards (SQS) Acknowledgement Statement Financial Statement for Resource Parenting Prior Service Reference Form Caregiver References List Caregiver Child Safety Agreement Confidentiality and Privacy Agreement Prospective Foster or Adoptive Parent Medical Evaluation Report Other Household Member Medical Evaluation Report (if applicable) Supplemental verifications include copies of the following: Marriage License/Divorce Decree Death Certificate (if applicable)Income Verification Lease/Mortgage Verification Automobile Insurance Verification TB Skin Test Results  if not completed during medical examination Drug screening results Most recent Water/Sewage Bill Approved well inspection within the last three years, if applicable Approved inspection of septic tank within the last four years, if applicable Pet Vaccination Record Immunization records for household members under the age of 18 Complete procedures 1-6 before sending a referral to a Foster Home Development Contractor or some other HSP for completion of the SAFE Home Study Evaluation.The SAFE Home Study Practitioner (HSP) will: Acknowledge receipt of a referral for completion of a SAFE Home Study within 72 hours. NOTE: This applies to contractors and may be accomplished via email. Confirm receipt of the onboarding documents and supplemental verifications from prospective caregivers before scheduling the introductory home visit.Schedule the introductory home visit with the prospective caregiver applicant(s) to begin the SAFE Home Study process within five business days of receipt of the referral. The visit shall be held no later than 10 calendar days after receipt of the referral. Use the Q1 Harvesting Sheet to review the Prospective Caregiver Application, Q1, and other documents submitted by each applicant. Make notes on the Q1 Harvesting Sheet regarding issues that generate curiosity about each applicant in preparation for home study interviews. Curiosity should be prompted by possible strengths, inconsistencies and issues that might be of concern.Review the results of safety screening and criminal records history check.  Meet with the SAFE Supervisor prior to the first home study interview to review the Prospective Caregiver Application, Questionnaire 1 (Q1) and Q1 Harvesting Sheet.  Organize all the information that has been received up to this point and plan the home study interviews. Identify things that generate curiosity and plan to address them over the span of all the home study interviews, not in a single interview.  If the results of the home inspection, safety screenings and criminal records history checks, etc. are satisfactory, contact the applicant to schedule the first home study visit. If the results are not satisfactory, consider other ways to partner with applicants (see policy 14.7 Resource Development: Inquiries and Information Sessions for ideas). Plan to conduct home study visits no less than seven and no more than 10 days apart.  Conduct the number of home study visits and interviews necessary to complete the SAFE Home Study (see Practice Guidance: Home Study Interviews). Interview all children and adults who reside in the home or are frequently in the home. Discuss things that made the HSP and SAFE Supervisor curious. Complete the Psychosocial Inventory (PSI) following each home visit. Provide applicants the forms and instructions needed to obtain required medical evaluations, drug screenings and CPR/First Aid training (e.g. Prospective Foster or Adoptive Parent Medical Evaluation Report, Other Household Member Medical Evaluation Report, etc.), as necessary. Directly administer Q2 to applicants while maintaining sight and control of the tool at all times. Do not provide Q2 to applicants before the moment it is administered. Administer Q2 in a private setting. For couples administer Q2 with both applicants present and together. Instruct members of a couple not to communicate with each other or ask any questions of each other or the HSP while completing Q2. Conduct a private, one-on-one interview with each applicant after Q2 has been completed. For couples, ask one applicant to leave or go to another area of the home and interview the other applicant privately. Repeat the process with the other applicant. Interview applicants privately and individually for no longer than 45 minutes each. Meet with the SAFE Supervisor following each home visit for consultation and feedback.Send all references the Reference Questionnaire. After receiving a response, speak with each reference as needed to gather more information and seek clarification of any of the information provided. If applicants indicate they were approved in other states, take steps to secure confirmation and begin collecting information for the home study: Obtain a Release of Information; Contact the other state in writing; Obtain a description of the training content and number of hours earned as part of pre-service and in-service hours; Request a copy of the familys initial evaluation and any subsequent evaluations; Request a written recommendation from the state regarding the capabilities and protective capacities of the family; upload into Georgia SHINES. Send a written explanation, signed by the County Director/Designee or CPA Director/Designee, to all families whose Kinship Foster Home Evaluation will not be completed within the 120-day timeframe. Indicate the reason for the delay and a projected timeframe for completion. Provide applicants the opportunity to read the authorized portion of the Home Study Report pertaining to their family and have them acknowledge doing so by signing the document.Send applicants a letter notifying them of the final approval decision within five business days. A home visit with approved caregivers will be scheduled within seven days of approval for the review and signing of the Caregiver Child Safety Agreement. Whether approved or disapproved, applicants must be made aware of their status within five business days. Initial contact may be made by telephone, immediately followed by a written letter to the family. If approval is granted, cordially welcome approved caregivers to the foster/adoption team and advise them of subsequent procedures. If approval is not granted, inform the applicants in an empathetic and supportive manner. Notwithstanding, the reason(s) for non-approval must be communicated in a clear, concise, and non-judgmental manner.The Social Services Supervisor will: Ensure all required safety screenings, criminal history records checks, and the Caregiver Home Inspection Safety and Compliance Checklist are completed before the HSP is assigned to begin the SAFE Home Study. Meet with the Caregiver Recruitment and Retention Specialist (CRRS)/CPA Resource Development (RD) Staff to review the results of the safety screenings, criminal history records checks and Caregiver Home Inspection Safety and Compliance Checklist to determine whether the family is eligible to continue the family evaluation process. Assign the home study for completion to a SAFE certified HSP who can address sensitive and difficult issues in an appropriate manner. Ensure all SAFE tools [Questionnaire1 (Q1), Questionnaire 2 (Q2), Q1 Harvesting Sheet, SAFE Desk Guide, Psychosocial Inventory (PSI) and Home Study Report] are used correctly. Meet with the HSP to discuss the Prospective Caregiver Application, results of Q1, and Q1 Harvesting Sheet to help organize the information and plan the home study interviews. Meet with the HSP following each home study interviewMeet with the HSP timely to prevent delays in the home study process. Review the Interview Worksheet to identify potential concerns and missed issues. Review the PSI after each home study interview and provide feedback to the HSP prior to the next home visit so the appropriate action can be taken regarding any concerns. Review Q2 after the Q2 home study interview. Review Desk Guide Ratings carefully. Check for expected SAFE Desk Guide ratings of 3, 4 or 5 as well as any surprise ratings that may require more discussion with the HSP. Ensure the HSP completes the sufficient number of interviews at the appropriate intervals (seven to 10 days apart).Meet with the HSP to discuss the final desk guide ratings and mitigation. Ensure that mitigation of a SAFE Desk Guide rating of 3, 4 or 5 is appropriate and supported by outside sources. Review the SAFE Home Study Report to ensure that it is thorough and that all issues are identified and discussed prior to final approval. Complete the SAFE Supervisor Home Study Certification and include in the file. Ensure applicants are given the opportunity to read the authorized portion of the Home Study Report pertaining to their family and have so acknowledged by signing the document. Routinely assess the foundational skills of the HSP (engagement and forensic interviewing skills; analytical and evaluation skills; and writing skills) and provide the education and support necessary to help the HSP strengthen skills as needed.PRACTICE GUIDANCEStructured Analysis Family Evaluation (SAFE) Home Study Components The SAFE Home Study is a placement document, an investigation, a psychosocial evaluation and a clear written report. It has four components: Information Gathering Tools- These tools support the Home Study Report and are designed to prompt the HSP to ask questions not provide answers: Questionnaire 1 (Q1)- It is completed by each applicant and covers eight areas of family history and functioning (i.e. Personal History; Parenting Practices; Personal and Family Values; Health; Support System; Work; Family Relationships; Marital/Partner Relationship).  Q1 Harvesting Sheet- It is used to review the Prospective Caregiver Application, QI and other documents submitted by applicants. It helps organize information to provide a complete overview of each applicants specific issues, behaviors, or events that should be addressed in upcoming home study interviews. Questionnaire 2 (Q2)- It contains the sensitive and critical questions that need to be addressed in a home study (i.e. Problem issues/behaviors; Personal alcohol consumption; Personal legal/illegal drug usage; Family substance abuse; History of sexual, emotional, or physical victimization; Child abuse allegations/convictions; Family violence and crime; Family sexual perpetrators; Domestic violence; Mental illness). Each applicant is interviewed privately and individually (one-on-one) immediately after the administration of Q2. Due to the sensitive and complex nature of these topics, this can be a very emotionally charged interview. Reference Letter- It was designed to enable the HSP to obtain more complex information about applicants for analysis and follow-up. After receiving the SAFE Reference Letter, the HSP should speak with each reference to gather more information and seek clarification of anything in the letter. Other than indicating they received the required references, the HSP should not mention the individual references specifically in the narration of the SAFE Home Study Report. Issues raised by references should be addressed with applicants. Any issues that merit a SAFE Desk Guide Rating of 3, 4, or 5 should be discussed in the Psychosocial Evaluation Section of the SAFE Home Study Report without revealing sources.Structured Analysis - SAFE has identified 70 Psychosocial Factors that research has demonstrated to be necessary for safe and effective parenting whether through adoption, kin or foster care. The Psychosocial Inventory (PSI) and SAFE Desk Guide allow the HSP to systematically analyze information gathered during the home study process, as well facilitate a clear and uniform identification of specific family strengths and issues of concern. The PSI and Desk Guide are grouped into the following nine sections: History; Personal Characteristics; Marital/Partner Relationship; Children/Others Residing/Frequently in the Home; Extended Family Relationships; Physical/Social Environment; General Parenting; Specialized Parenting; and Adoption/Foster Care Issues. The PSI is designed to look at a persons history of issues, concerns, behaviors and events and determine how they affect the persons current functioning and ability to parent. The PSI strives to help the HSP determine whether an applicant can parent, and if so, who they can parent. Only one PSI is used per family and is completed after each home study visit. The SAFE Desk Guide is a severity scale that indicates the potential seriousness of an issue, behavior or event experienced by an applicant. The PSI and SAFE Desk Guide contain research-based factors that support safe and effective family functioning and the ability to parent. The factors are rated on a scale of 1 to 5 and marked on the PSI. The ratings represent the following: 1=Exceptional Strength; 2= Strength; 3=Concern; 4=Serious Concern; 5=Extremely Serious Concern. A rating of 2 is the default rating until proven otherwise. A rating of 2 may also be used early in the home study process when the HSP does not have enough information to rate a factor. In other words, it can function as the I dont know rating until more information is gathered. A completed home study report should not have an abundance of 2 ratings which is not indicative of a thorough assessment. Any psychosocial factor that merits a rating of 3 (Concern), 4 (Serious Concern) or 5 (Extremely Serious Concern) must be specifically addressed in the Home Study Report. As more information is gathered during the home study interview process, a rating may move to a more serious rating, but not in reverse. As soon as possible following each home study visit, the HSP should mark the applicable SAFE Desk Guide ratings on the PSI. Entering the ratings while the visit is still fresh in ones mind prevents one from forgetting issues of concern or confusing them with other studies. A different symbol is used to mark the ratings on the PSI for each home visit. For example, the symbol used to mark the rating for the first home study visit is a backward slash, whereas the symbol used to mark the second home study visit is a forward slash. The SAFE Desk Guide ratings should reflect everything the HSP knows up to that point. After each interview, the HSP submits the PSI to the Supervisor for review and feedback. The final SAFE Desk Guide Rating is made after the last home study visit and must be made with a high degree of confidence based on the HSP and the SAFE Supervisors professional assessment.Home Study Report  The narrative is designed to assist the HSP in focusing on the issues of concern within a family that will or could impact its ability to care for a child placed in the home. A home study should be specific to the applicant. The HSPs should use behaviorally specific language and avoid repeating the same thing throughout the study. There are six sections to a SAFE Home Study Report: Non-narrative reporting required by the agency (i.e. general information; contact information; household demographics; medical/school reports; safety screening and criminal records history results; confirmation statements; attachments and verifications) Motivation, Profile and Lifestyles of Applicants SAFE Psychosocial Evaluation Conclusions and Placement Considerations Signatures and Approvals SAFE Psychosocial Inventory Results (NOTE: this page should be removed when the SAFE Home Study Report is shared with applicants) Compatibility Inventory - This is an optional matching tool designed to facilitate successful placements. This tool helps the HSP determine the willingness and ability of an applicant to parent children with certain issues and behaviors.Home Study Interviews The home study interview is the foundation of the home study process. The various gathering tools used with the SAFE model support the interviews and help the HSP develop questions for the applicants. HSPs learn more from applicants when applicants are interviewed at home where they are most comfortable. During interviews, HSPs should avoid using standardized questions and rushing ahead with their own agenda. Instead, the HSP should seek a natural, organic flow of communication with applicants. HSPs should trust their instincts but must be mindful of their own biases. HSPs must also remain keenly aware of non-verbal communication which guides about 80% of human interaction. No interview should take longer than an hour and a half. It is unlikely that any party will remain as alert as they need to be for longer than that period of time. Home visits should be no closer or further than a week apart because applicants need time to process the information covered between visits, but not so much time that they begin to lose information. The initial visit to during which the Caregiver Home Inspection Safety and Compliance Checklist is completed should not be confused with a Home Study Interview. These are two different things and should not be done at the same time. The home inspection is authoritative and regulatory whereas the home study interview is collaborative and transparent",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-22-kinship-section-224-kinship-foster-home-evaluation

Home Study Visit 1 (1st Interview)

This introductory interview is designed to develop the relationship between the Home Study Practitioner (HSP) and the applicants.
Discussion of SAFE Questionnaire 1 (Q1).
Home Study Visit 2 (2nd and 3rd Interview if it is a two-parent home)

Administration of SAFE Questionnaire 2 (Q2) which must never be out of the sight or control of the HSP.
This includes a one-on-one history interview focusing on issues, behaviors, and events that could affect the applicants current functioning or ability to parent, highlighting how past issues have been resolved.
Observations of all applicants while they complete Q2; applicants should not talk or discuss the questionnaire during completion.
After Q2, each applicant is interviewed separately and privately. No children or other adults should be present in the home during this session. If others must remain in the home, they should not be near the area where Q2 is administered.
Interviews for Q2 should be no longer than 45 minutes each, but additional one-on-one/history interviews might be necessary depending on complexity.
Home Study Visit 3 (4th Interview)

This session focuses on marriage or support interviews, examining the applicants relationships and the dynamics of their marriage/partnership. For single applicants, the focus is on their support systems.
Interviews may include family members and others residing in or frequently visiting the home.
Mitigation Process

Within the SAFE model, mitigation involves balancing the truth (Final SAFE Desk Guide Ratings) and justice (HSPs clinical analysis of the impact on an applicant's current functioning and ability to parent).
Mitigation applies to all Final SAFE Desk Guide Ratings of 3, 4, and 5, focusing on current functioning rather than past occurrences.
Mitigation results in a rating using the SAFE severity scale, reflecting the professional assessment of the HSP and their supervisor.
Options in mitigation include:
Sustain: The issue/behavior/event is not resolved.
Reduce: The issue/behavior/event is partially resolved but still affects current functioning or ability to parent.
Erase: The issue/behavior/event is fully resolved and does not impact current functioning.
Qualifications for Initial Family Evaluation

SAFE Certified DFCS staff, SAFE Certified CPA Resource Development staff, or qualified contractors can serve as SAFE Home Study Practitioners.
Contractors must meet specific criteria including:
Certification in the SAFE model.
A minimum bachelor's degree in Social Work, Counseling, Psychology, or a related field.
Comprehensive understanding of pre-service training philosophies and concepts.
Commitment to the agency's mission.

Kin includes: GrandparentsSiblings Extended family membersTribal members Godparents Stepparents Anyone with a family like relationship with the childWhen out-of-home care is needed, kinship care is the preferred option because it can reduce trauma and help children maintain family bonds, a sense of belonging, and their identity.Research shows that children benefit from kinship care in many ways. Kinship care can reduce the trauma that children may have previously endured and the trauma that accompanies parental separation by providing them with a sense of stability and belonging in an otherwise unsettling time. Kinship care has the following benefits: Connections with a childs birth family, extended family, siblings, and community bonds that are essential to well-being Minimize traumaPreservation of cultural identity Increase the chances the siblings will remain together Placement stability compared to children in other out-of-home care arrangements Prospective kinship caregivers should be provided all the information on the childs needs and situation to allow the prospective caregiver and DFCS to make the best possible placement decision for the child.Success of Placement with Kinship Caregivers The success of placement with a kinship caregiver(s) can be positively impacted by: The extent of kin caregivers preparation for meeting the child(ren)s needs. The accuracy of their kin caregivers perceptions of the requirements for managing the child(ren) and his/her needs (i.e., medical, physical, emotional, educational, and/or behavioral issues). The open communication and information sharing between the DFCS, the family and kinship caregivers. Their kin caregivers familiarity with and commitment to abide by the agencys requirements regarding children in out-of-home placements.Placement with a kinship caregiver(s) may not be appropriate when: Child abuse has been substantiated on the kinship caregiver. Unsatisfactory criminal records checks are received. Safety concerns are identified. They are unable to meet the on-going needs of the child(ren). Parental interference in the placement would negatively affect the child(ren).  They are not willing to accept the placement. They are openly or passively hostile or negative toward the parents, child(ren) or DFCS. They are unable or unwilling to protect the child(ren) from risks or harm from others. They are unable or unwilling to comply with agency or court ordered visitation plans or outcome of reunification.Kinship Coordinator The Kinship Coordinators partner with kinship caregivers to identify needs of the caregivers and children that would impact the kinship caregivers ability to provide adequate care for the children. Following the Kinship Needs Assessment, the Kinship Coordinator will partner with the SSCM to provide or arrange individualized services to address the identified needs. This includes providing kinship caregivers with information about how to access health care, financial support and public benefits, legal assistance, emergency services, respite etc. and/or linking the kinship caregiver with community services such as support groups and counseling. In addition, kinship caregivers are provided information on the court system, including the different types of hearings, court procedures, and the kinship caregivers role in any court proceedings. The Kinship Coordinators involvement begins at the initiation of out-of-home care with a kinship caregiver and continues until the kinship arrangement or placement is no longer needed.Full Disclosure Full disclosures will be provided to the voluntary kinship caregiver by the Kinship Coordinator when the child(ren) enters the home of the kinship caregiver. Explain the role and responsibilities of a voluntary kinship caregiver. Ensure that the kinship caregiver is willing to maintain the child(ren)s safety and wellbeing. Identify the role kinship caregiver(s) has in assisting the parent(s)/guardian(s)/legal custodian(s) in achieving the conditions for return.Explain agency terms and definitions (i.e. kinship caregiver, TAFC, conditions for return), including DFCS requirement to abide by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and confidentiality standards. Explore the available services. Inform of legal options and financial support. Advise how to access the Kinship Navigator Program. Explore short term and long-term implications for caring for a child(ren) who is unable to live with their parent(s)/guardian(s)/legal custodian(s). Provide the Kinship Pathway to help kin caregivers navigate DFCS. Advise decisions will be made in partnership with the family based upon individual needs of the child(ren) and family, while considering safety, permanency, and wellbeing.Although full disclosure is the discussion with the kinship caregiver, information will also be provided in writing to the kin caregivers via the Kinship Pathways. The kinship caregiver(s) will sign the Disclosure Statement Form acknowledging the discussion and receipt of the written information. The Kinship Coordinator will provide subsequent updated full disclosures when the permanency plan changes (i.e. non-reunification, adoption) or there is change in the kinship caregivers role (i.e. a kinship placement caregiver that transitioning into a kinship foster parent).Kinship Needs Assessment Kinship Caregiver Needs Assessment is a conduit to facilitate a discussion with the kinship caregivers regarding the tangible needs they will require to successfully care for the child(ren). The Needs Assessment assists the parent, kinship caregivers, case manager, and community providers to accurately identify what services and supports would be needed to strengthen the out-of-home arrangement. The Kinship Needs Assessment is an ongoing evaluation that is child and caregiver focused. Every kinship caregiver will have different needs based on their parenting experience and skills, prior knowledge of the child, and community resource knowledge. It should be expected that the identified needs of the kinship caregiver will change throughout the agency involvement. Tips for Supporting Kinship Caregivers The following Tips should be considered when placing a child with Kin/ Fictive Kin Caregivers:  Ensure the caregiver is informed and supported throughout the kinship assessment and foster home evaluation process.Maintain regular contact with the regional kinship coordinator and the resource development staff to assist with kinship placements. Ensure the safety screens are completed prior to initiating a home assessment. Inform the caregiver of the timeframes and keep them abreast of any delays. Work with the caregiver to get forms or other information that may be needed to expedite the process. Proactively address any barriers to the foster care kinship placement or foster home evaluation approval process. Consideration should be given to approving the Abbreviated Kinship Assessment and the Subsidy Application simultaneously to ensure continuity of approval dates.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-22-kinship-section-222-use-kinship-caregivers-foster-care

When children cannot remain safely with their parents, care provided by kin is preferred to maintain family connections and minimize trauma to the child. When considering a voluntary kinship arrangement, the SSCM has a vital role in helping the parent(s)/legal guardian(s) in determining if the use of a voluntary kinship is a viable option for their family by explaining what is and what to expect during a voluntary kinship arrangement. The SSCM, in collaboration with parents, should identify potential kin who can safely care for the child while parents receive services to help them address the issues that brought the child to the attention of child welfare and render them unsafe in the home. Factors to consider in identifying potential voluntary kinship caregivers: Who would the parent most want to care for the child? Who does the parent most often turn to in time of crisis? Who has cared for the child in the past when parents were unable to? With whom does the child have a close relationship? Who does the parent feel most comfortable with sharing confidential information? Voluntary kinship caregivers relationship to the child and length of involvement with the family. Description of the voluntary kinship caregivers involvement with the family, i.e., provided care for the child and/or parent, assisted the family through crisis, provided moral support, member of church or community organization, neighbor, etc. Whether the voluntary kinship caregiver ever resided in the home with the parent or child and, if so, how long and when.A voluntary kinship arrangement should not be considered in situations involving chronic and/or severe child maltreatment. Such situations should be addressed with court intervention. In addition, a voluntary kinship caregiver should not be used when the safety threat cannot be mitigated or resolved within 90 calendar days or less. Circumstances that may require more than 90 days to resolve the safety threats should be staffed with the Supervisor and the SAAG consulted to determine the need for legal intervention. When voluntary kinships are utilized improperly, it can have a negative impact on the family, and result in the unnecessary placement of a child into foster care.Out-of-State Voluntary Kinship Caregivers DFCS shall not support the use of out-of-state voluntary kinship caregivers unless an Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC) border agreement exists between the county and the other state. See policy 15.8 Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children: Border Agreements.Non-Custodial Parents and Voluntary Kinship Caregivers Non-custodial parents (absent parents, biological fathers, putative fathers, legal fathers, or biological mothers who do not reside with their child) are not voluntary kinship caregivers. The parent/legal guardian can elect to have a non-custodial parent care for their child in lieu of a voluntary kinship caregiver. Non-custodial parents providing care for their child is not a voluntary kinship arrangement. Under these circumstances, DFCS still has the responsibility to ensure child safety in the non-custodial parents home. This includes conducting safety assessments and developing an in-home safety plan with the non-custodial parents to address identified safety issues and strategies (example: how long the child will reside with the noncustodial parent, custodial parent contact, access to the maltreater, etc.) (see policy 19.12 Case Management: Safety Plan & Management).When the Parent/Legal Guardian Moves In When a parent/legal guardian moves into the home of the voluntary kinship caregiver, it is no longer a voluntary kinship arrangement. When this occurs, terminate the voluntary kinship arrangement in Georgia SHINES and conduct a safety assessment to evaluate child safety (see policy 19.11 Case Management: Safety Assessment) to determine if a new or updated safety plan is needed. Conditions for Return Conditions for return are written statements related to the safety (present or impending dangers) and risk issues identified that justified implementing an out-of-home safety plan. These statements describe what needs to occur before the child(ren) can safely return to their home and are specific to a parent/legal guardian and/or the home environment. Statements must include:The safety concerns and diminished caregiver protective capacities that created the need for the child(ren) to reside out of the home; The specific conditions and circumstances required for the safe return of the child (based upon the type and degree of change that is needed); How the changes will be implemented to achieve the safe and successful resolution of the safety concerns and the child(ren)s return home; and The parent(s)/legal guardian(s) response to intervention and willingness to make the changes necessary for the child(ren) to return home.Parent-Child Contact Recommendations The parent-child relationship should be protected and can be strengthened throughout a childs time in the home of a voluntary kinship caregiver by ensuring parents are fully encouraged and supported to participate in parenting activities and decisions. When considering parent-child contact during the voluntary kinship arrangement, safety is paramount. However, it is necessary to also consider the benefits of quality time children spend with their parents. The least limiting option necessary to ensure child safety should be recommended. In rare circumstances, DFCS may need to recommend no parent-child contact during a voluntary kinship arrangement to ensure child safety. These instances should be limited in duration, resolved quickly and safety assessed frequently to determine if parent-child contact can resume.7-10 Day Family Meeting The 7-10 day family meeting allows the family and kinship caregivers to build consensus on the roles and responsibilities of the kinship caregivers, parents/legal guardians and DFCS during the voluntary kinship arrangement. Individuals who play a role in supporting the family during Voluntary Kinship Arrangement should be included in the 7-10 day family meeting: Parent(s)/legal guardian(s) Investigations and Family Preservation SSCMVoluntary kinship caregiver(s) Kinship Coordinator Service provider(s)Child (if age appropriate)While preparing for and conducting the 7-10 day family meeting, adhere to confidentiality and protected health information (PHI) laws. See policy 19.3 Case Management: Solution-Focused Family Team Meetings for procedures for preparing the family and their family team members for the meeting. This includes exploring if disclosure of confidential information and/or PHI is relevant to addressing child safety and necessary for the purpose of the meeting and obtaining informed consent prior to disclosure.The family meeting should: Define the roles and responsibilities of all the kinship caregivers and discuss the requirements of the out-of-home safety plan; Develop a plan with the parent and the voluntary kinship caregiver(s) to ensure the minimal disruption to the childs life and the childs needs are being met, including parent-child contact (if applicable);  Identify who is responsible for transporting the child to and from school, how medical needs will be addressed and any other well-being concerns; Further explore the voluntary kinship caregivers capacity to continue the care of the child on a temporary basis;  Explain the parent/caregiver remains financially responsible for the child while in the care of the voluntary kinship caregiver(s); Clearly articulate that the child is not in DFCS custody; Discuss alternative safety responses, including foster care or an in-home safety plan.Kinship Caregiver 45th Day Meeting The Kinship Caregiver 45th day meeting assists the SSCM, family and kinship caregivers in ensuring that the case is progressing as needed to return the child(ren) home within the 90- day timeframe. The meeting should be used to discuss: The parent(s)/legal guardian(s) progress toward meeting the conditions of return; Any additional safety threats that exist; Barriers to returning the child home within the 90-day timeframe; Families progress with services; The voluntary kinship caregivers willingness to be a placement resource, if the child enters foster care; and Next steps to ensure permanency for the children.The case manager and supervisor must be honest and transparent with the family about the status of their case and the likelihood of them meeting the 90-day timeframe. The 45th day kinship caregiver meeting should be heavily focused on resolving or mitigating the safety threats that exist and prevent the child(ren) from returning home within the 90-day time frame. The 45th day meeting may be conducted in conjunction with the initial FPS FTM if all areas are addressed.Addressing Barriers and/or Lack of Progress in Voluntary Kinship Care Barriers are defined as circumstances that prevent the parent/legal guardian(s) from obtaining the conditions of returns. When barriers arise, they should be thoroughly evaluated, including determining how the barriers impact safety. Engage the family, voluntary kinship caregivers, and service providers regarding the barriers and how it is impacting the parent(s)/legal guardian(s) from obtaining the conditions of return. Hold an FTM with the family, supervisor, Kinship Coordinator and the voluntary kinship caregiver to develop a plan to overcome the barrier(s). Some barriers may not be able to be addressed immediately. In addition, some barriers may require court interventions to allot time for the family and permanency for the children. If it is determined that court intervention is needed, make every effort to discuss within the FTM. Multiple Voluntary Kinship Caregivers In cases, involving large sibling groups it may be necessary to have multiple voluntary kinship caregivers. If multiple kinship caregivers are needed ensure the Kinship Assessment is completed for each voluntary kinship caregiver. Invite each voluntary kinship caregiver to the family meeting and ensure that communication with each caregiver is maintained during the voluntary kinship arrangement. There may also be times when a child has to be moved to another voluntary kinship caregiver during the 90-day time frame. If this occurs a family meeting should be convened to ensure everyone is clear on the expectations and timeframe for the kinship placement. A kinship assessment must be completed for the new voluntary kinship caregiver. The 90-calendar day timeframe for a child to be in a voluntary kinship caregiver is calculated cumulatively from the date the initial voluntary kinship arrangement went into effect and does not begin again when/if a child has to be moved to another voluntary kinship caregiver. Under no circumstances should a child be in a voluntary kinship arrangement beyond 90 calendar days.Kinship Coordinator The Kinship Coordinators partner with kinship caregivers to identify needs of the caregivers and children that would impact the kinship caregivers ability to provide adequate care for the child(ren). Following the Kinship Caregiver Needs Assessment, the Kinship Coordinator will partner with the SSCM to provide or arrange individualized services to address the identified needs. This includes providing kinship caregivers with information about how to access health care for the child, financial support and public benefits, legal assistance, emergency services, etc. and/or linking the kinship caregiver with community services such as support groups and counseling. In addition, kinship caregivers are provided information on the court system, including the different types of hearings, court procedures, and the kinship caregivers role in any court proceedings. The Kinship Coordinators involvement begins at the initiation of outof-home care with a kinship caregiver and continues until the voluntary kinship arrangement is no longer needed or through the continuum if the child must enter foster care and is placed in a foster care kinship resource.Full Disclosure Full disclosures will be provided to the voluntary kinship caregiver by the Kinship Coordinator when the child(ren) enters the home of the kinship caregiver. Explain the role and responsibilities of a voluntary kinship caregiver. Ensure that the kinship caregiver is willing to maintain the child(ren)s safety and wellbeing. Identify the role the kinship caregiver(s) has in assisting the parent(s)/legal guardian(s) in achieving the conditions for return.  Explain agency terms and definitions (i.e. kinship caregiver, TAFC, conditions for return), including DFCS requirement to abide by HIPAA) and confidentiality standards. Explore the available services. Inform of legal options and financial support. Advise how to access the Kinship Navigator Program. Explore short term and long-term implications for caring for a child(ren) who is unable to live with their parent(s)/legal guardian(s). Provide the Kinship Pathway to help kin caregivers navigate DFCS. Advise decisions will be ",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-22-kinship-section-221-use-voluntary-kinship-caregivers

Discussions about the care of children are made in partnership with the family, considering the individual needs of the children and family, as well as safety, permanency, and well-being.
Full disclosure will be provided not only verbally in discussions with kinship caregivers but also in writing via the Kinship Pathways.
Kinship caregivers are required to sign the Disclosure Statement Form to acknowledge both the discussion and the receipt of written information.
The Kinship Coordinator will provide updated full disclosures when there are changes in the permanency plan (e.g., non-reunification, adoption) or changes in the kinship caregivers role (e.g., transitioning from a kinship placement caregiver to a kinship foster parent).
Kinship Caregiver Needs Assessment

This assessment facilitates discussions with kinship caregivers about the tangible needs required to successfully care for the children.
It helps parents, kinship caregivers, case managers, and community providers to accurately identify necessary services and supports to strengthen the out-of-home arrangement.
The Needs Assessment is ongoing, child and caregiver-focused, and acknowledges that every kinship caregiver's needs may change based on their parenting experience, prior knowledge of the child, and knowledge of community resources.
Power of Attorney (POA)

The POA is a legal agreement between the parents/legal guardians and the voluntary kinship caregiver, allowing the caregiver to act in place of the parents for the child.
POAs support voluntary kinship caregivers in circumstances where the parent is not readily available, such as registering the child in school or authorizing medical care.
Before initiating a voluntary kinship arrangement, the SSCM informs the parents/legal guardians about the option to enter into a POA.
Parents/legal guardians are advised to consult an attorney if they have concerns about the POA before initiation.
Responsibilities under the POA include:
The POA must be completed by both the parents/legal guardians and the voluntary kinship caregiver.
The completed POA needs to be filed in the probate court of the county where the child resides.
The voluntary kinship caregiver must keep an original copy of the POA as proof of their authority to make decisions on behalf of the child.
A copy of the POA must be provided to the DFCS SSCM.
Parents/legal guardians retain the right to dissolve the POA at any time, and the POA does not terminate the parents' legal rights or end DFCS involvement.

GA :: Child Welfare Policy Manual :: Chapter 22 Kinship :: Section 22.0 Introduction To Kinship,Georgia,Rules,"2023, 2022, 2021, 2020","Definitions, Kinship",,,"DISCUSSIONGeorgia Division of Family and Children Services (DFCS) strives to provide services and resources to keep children in their homes with their families whenever possible. When children cannot remain safely with their parents, DFCS recognizes that children thrive best in kinship care and through its Kinship Continuum prioritizes placement with kinship caregivers as the preferred and best option for children. Kinship care is the full-time care and nurturing of a child by a relative or fictive kin (an individual with a significant connection to the child, such as a close family friend). Kinship relationships should be respected based on the family's cultural values and emotional ties. Research shows that kinship care reduces trauma to the child by maintaining family bonds, connections, traditions, a sense of belonging, and identity for the child. Further, kinship care increases placement stability and permanency for children and creates an opportunity to strengthen the family. DFCSs Kinship Continuum includes voluntary kinship arrangements to prevent children from entering foster care, and kinship foster care placements when children must enter foster care. DFCS makes diligent efforts to identify and locate relatives or committed individuals who has a significant relationship with the child who can safely care for them while parents receive treatment and services. While the goal for children in kinship care is to safely return home with their parents, kinship caregivers are encouraged to support the goal of a safe return home but remain willing to provide a permanent home if children cannot return home. Kinship caregivers can assist families by providing safe, loving environments for the children, being positive role models for the parents, and generally supporting the families through difficult times. It is important for DFCS staff to understand the family dynamics and relationships and provide full disclosure so that everyone is aware of all aspects of the process to support positive outcome for children and families.Kinship (Kin) Kin includes relatives and fictive kin. A relative is someone defined by blood, marriage or adoption, including the spouse of any of those persons even if the marriage was terminated by death or divorce. Fictive kin is a person who is not related to the child by blood, marriage, or adoption but who prior to his or her placement in foster care is known to the family, has a substantial and positive relationship with the child, and is willing and able to provide a suitable home for the child. Kinship caregivers may include: Grandparents Siblings Extended family members Tribal members Godparents Anyone with a family like relationship with the childVoluntary Kinship Voluntary Kinship serves as the foundation of Kinship Care. The purpose of voluntary kinship is to serve as a safety and crisis intervention modality that works to stabilize the family dynamic and utilizes the Solution Based Casework tenants (natural helpers) and practices to address the identified safety threats leading to the need for temporary out of home placement via an out of home Safety Plan. Kinship Foster Care Kinship foster care may become necessary if safety threats cannot be mitigated via an in-home safety plan, voluntary kinship, or if the condition for return were not met within the 90-day voluntary kinship arrangement. Kinship caregivers typically are motivated by a desire or obligation to step in at a critical moment to meet the caregiving needs for a specific child when a biological parent/caregiver is unable. A growing body of research confirms that, in most circumstances, kinship foster care is the best option when children cannot live with their own parents. Several studies have found that children in kinship foster care are better able to adjust to their new environment and are less likely to experience behavioral problems and psychiatric disorders than those in the general foster care population. Finally, children in kinship foster care experience fewer school disruptions than children in non-kin foster care, and their sense of identity and self-esteem is reinforced.Kinship Assessment Child safety is paramount when identifying kinship caregivers. It is vital for all frontline staff to ensure that children are being placed in a home that will meet the childs needs for safety, permanency, and well-being. The Kinship Assessment is an evaluation of the kinship caregiver(s), the home environment and the capacity of the kinship caregiver(s) to safely meet the needs of the children. Kinship Coordinators Kinship Coordinators partner with kinship caregivers to identify needs of the caregivers and children that would impact the kinship caregivers ability to provide adequate care for the child(ren). They assist kinship families in identifying and locating resources within their local community, and work to close gaps and/or delays in service delivery to kinship caregivers.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-22-kinship-section-220-introduction-kinship

welfare agency in the state of the childs legal residence. NOTE: This will be completed by the permanency SSS.PRACTICE GUIDANCEDFCS is legally authorized to provide emergency care and supervision to any child without seeking a court order for a period not to exceed seven calendar days when the child is a victim of human trafficking (labor or sexual servitude) and one or more of the following circumstances apply: The childs legal residence is outside of Georgia and contact with the states child welfare agency will be or has been initiated for transfer of custody or contact has been made with the parent(s) to regain physical custody of the child. The child is a national of another country (someone other than a U.S. citizen or U.S. permanent or temporary legal resident alien) and contact will be initiated with the consulate where the child has citizenship to facilitate the childs return to his/her country of origin. There is concern that the child will return to the human trafficking situation and a secure facility is required and will be available within seven calendar days.Any person who has knowledge of the human trafficking and has reason to believe its true can make a request for STEC (Human Trafficking). However, prior to executing a STEC (Human Trafficking) DFCS must determine the circumstances meet the criteria for a Special Circumstance STEC (Human Trafficking). Human trafficking is a form of maltreatment; therefore, an investigation must be conducted within the Special Circumstance Short Term Emergency Care (Human Trafficking) unless there is an active or previously conducted investigation concerning the human trafficking allegations. The investigation is not required to be concluded or substantiated to determine the child is a human trafficking victim; the childs or law enforcements confirmation is sufficient to qualify the child as a victim for the purposes of STEC (Human Trafficking). Once executed, the STEC (Human Trafficking) agreement gives DFCS the same rights and powers regarding the child as the parent, including the authority to consent to medical care. At any point, during the even calendar day STEC period, the legal custodian may authorize a designated caregiver. A designated caregiver is a person or facility who will assume care and supervision of the child. The legal custodian may designate whomever he/she wishes as a caregiver of the child. The child can be released to the person having custody at the time the child was taken into DFCS custody or the designated caregiver, at any time during the seven days STEC period. Upon releasing the child terminate the STEC (Human Trafficking) agreement by completing the Emergency Care and Supervision of a Child Without a Court Order (Termination) form to relieve DFCS of custody and all responsibility for the child. When the parent(s), designated caregiver (person of facility), or child welfare agency in the state of the childs legal residence is unable to assume care and supervision of the child within seven calendar days of executing STEC (Human Trafficking) agreement, DFCS is required to file a dependency petition in Juvenile Court seeking temporary legal custody of the child (see policy 17.1 Legal: The Juvenile Court Process).STEC Human Trafficking/Child is a Resident of Another State When DFCS accepts a STEC (Human Trafficking) when the child is resident of another state contact should immediately be made with the states child welfare agency to arrange for the transfer of custody or with the childs parents to regain physical custody of the child.STEC Human Trafficking/Child is a Foreign National of Another Country When DFCS accepts a STEC (Human Trafficking) when the child is a foreign national contact should immediately be made with the consulate where the child has citizenship in accordance with policy 10.17 Foster Care: Service Needs of an Immigrant Child to arrange for the transfer of custody to repatriate the child.STEC Human Trafficking/ Secure Facility Required For DFCS to accept a STEC (Human Trafficking) request when there is concern that the child will return to the human trafficking situation, the designated caregiver must be a secure facility where the child has a confirmed acceptance or is expected to be enrolled within seven calendar days.

The VPA may be extended once, under limited circumstances, for an additional 90 days. DFCS is under no obligation to accept the request for a voluntary placement when it is determined not to be in the childs best interests, maltreatment exists, or the child is deemed unsafe. Prior to accepting a request for a VPA, the SSCM must make reasonable efforts to prevent the removal of the child from his/her home.This includes exploring the reasons the parent is requesting the placement, efforts made to mitigate the need for placement, kin who are available to provide support care, and any services DFCS could provide that may alleviate the need for placement. Once executed, the VPA gives DFCS the same rights and duties as an order from the court granting DFCS temporary custody of the child. Therefore a Family Functioning Assessment is required to inform the case plan addressing the need for placement (permanency) and wellbeing. While the child is in DFCS custody under the VPA, the parent, guardian, or custodian, is allowed to submit a written request for the child to be returned to their custody.Voluntary Placements Involving Indian Children When a parent requests to voluntarily place an Indian child in foster care DFCS must comply with, and afford all rights under the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA). This includes making active efforts to prevent removal, notifications to the childs Tribe, and selection of a placement resource. In addition, a VPA involving an Indian child must be recorded and certified by the judge or the court in order to be considered valid.

GA :: Child Welfare Policy Manual :: Chapter 20 Special Circumstances :: Section 20.0 Introduction To Special Circumstances,Georgia,Rules,"2023, 2022, 2021","Administrative process, Investigations, Safety",,,"DISCUSSION As the designated child welfare agency in Georgia, the Division of Family and Children Services (DFCS) is legally mandated to investigate reports of known or suspected instances of child abuse; including physical or mental injury, sexual abuse or exploitation, or negligent treatment/maltreatment under circumstances that indicate the childs health or welfare is threatened. Federal and state laws also identify other distinct conditions that must be evaluated, addressed, or are allowable under the law related to child welfare that DFCS manages. These unique situations as classified a special circumstance.Types of Special Circumstances There are two types of special circumstances; the first of which includes no allegations of maltreatment. These assessments are not considered Child Protective Services (CPS) investigations and there is no maltreatment finding. These include: Child Withdrawn From Public School: This assessment is limited by the law to determining whether the school withdrawal was to avoid educating the child when the child has not attended school for a period of 45 days or more and there is no record of a Home Study Program Declaration of Intent Form filed with the Georgia Department of Education (GaDOE). Juvenile or Superior Court: Generally, these situations include a request by the court for DFCS to evaluate a home, assess family dynamics, conduct interviews, etc. These requests could be a result of DFCS filing a petition with the court or a private dependency case. Child in Need of Services (CHINS): When a child is identified as in need of care, guidance, counseling, structure, supervision, treatment, or rehabilitation due to certain behaviors or conditions and adjudicated as a CHINS by juvenile court, DFCS may be ordered to complete an assessment of family functioning, provide services, take custody of the child, or become a plan manager for an unrestorably incompetent youth.Safe Place for Newborns: This law provides an opportunity for mothers in crisis to safely relinquish their newborn babies to designated locations where the babies are protected from endangerment; providing mothers with an alternative without fear of being prosecuted for abandonment or neglect. DFCS is required to assume physical and legal custody of the newborn within six hours of an intake report meeting Safe Place for Newborns criteria.  Infants Prenatally Exposed to Substances: Infants identified as affected by prenatal exposure to substances are assessed for any health and developmental needs along with an assessment of the health and substance use disorder needs of parents and their families. Following identification of needs, a Plan of Safe Care is developed and implemented with the family to address child and family well-being. Voluntary Placement of a Child in Foster Care: DFCS may recognize that a family is experiencing a short-term crisis unrelated to safety or maltreatment, and at its discretion provide foster care services through the use of a Voluntary Placement Agreement for a period of 90 calendar days without a court order. An assessment of family functioning is completed to inform the case plan addressing the need for placement (permanency) and well-being. Voluntary Surrender of Parental Rights: DFCS may, at its discretion utilize a voluntary surrender of parental rights when a parent wishes to place their child, who is not in foster care, for adoption. Prior to accepting a voluntary surrender of parental rights DFCS must fully disclose to the parent(s) about the impact of the decision; explore alternative plans, determine whether adoption is a viable plan for the child, and examine the parents ability make an informed decision about a voluntary surrender. Short Term Emergency Care (Emergency or Illness): When a parent has an emergency or illness requiring immediate care and supervision of a child, DFCS may provide emergency care and supervision to the child without a court order for a period not to exceed seven calendar days through the use of Short Term Emergency Care.The other types of special circumstances are situations containing allegations of maltreatment and are therefore required to be completed as a CPS Investigation in accordance with policy 5.1 Investigations: Conducting an Investigation. These include: Short Term Emergency Care-Human Trafficking (Labor or Sexual Servitude): DFCS may provide emergency care and supervision to any child without seeking a court order for a period not to exceed seven calendar days when the child is a victim of human trafficking (labor or sexual servitude) under certain circumstances. Prior to executing a STEC for a human trafficking situation DFCS must determine that the circumstances meet the specific criteria for this type of special circumstance. In addition, as human trafficking is a form of maltreatment an investigation must be active or previously conducted concerning the human trafficking allegations. Temporary Custody of a Child Taken by a Physician Without a Court Order and Without Parental Consent: A physician may take temporary protective custody a child without a court order or parental consent when he/she has reasonable cause to believe that the child is in a circumstance or condition that presents imminent danger to the childs life or health as a result of suspected abuse or neglect; or he/she determines there is reasonable cause to believe that the child has been abused or neglected and there is not sufficient time for a court order to be obtained for temporary custody of the child before the child may be removed from the presence of the physician. DFCS must assume physical custody of the child within six hours of the physician taking custody and begin assessing the circumstances or conditions that present an imminent danger to the child's life or health as a result of suspected abuse.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-20-special-circumstances-section-200-introduction-special

A contracted provider may be used to ensure appropriate supervision of the child, when applicable. NOTE: The medical hospital will not provide supervision for children with behavioral issues, however, if a child is in a treatment facility supervision should be provided.Discharge Planning for a Child in Foster Care The SSCM will: Begin discharge planning at the time of admission. Identify placement options as soon as the child enters the hospital or treatment facility considering any special medical or behavioral health needs the child may have, when applicable (see policy 10.4 Foster Care: Selecting a Placement Resource).  If the child has special medical or behavioral health needs, arrange for or ensure that the placement resource and any other designated caregivers of the child complete any needed training to appropriately address the childs condition prior to the discharge. NOTE: The hospital or treatment facility may also request that a secondary caregiver be trained to care for the child. Have a solid plan for transitioning the child from the hospital or treatment facility to an approved placement setting, including arranging transportation and obtaining any medication the child may need post-discharge. Obtain information from the medical/treatment care team regarding needed outpatient follow-up and share information with the placement resource. If adjustments are needed to the discharge plan, escalate the matter as follows:  County Director Regional Director DFCS Care Coordination Treatment Unit Be present at the specified date and time of a childs discharge (including evenings, weekends, and holidays). Obtain copies of the discharge summary and any recommendations from the hospital/treatment facility regarding services and supports the child may need to be successful at home or in an out-of-home placement. Provide a copy of the discharge summary to the placement resource to maintain continuity of care.Documentation of Hospital and Treatment Facility Care The SSCM will:  Submit the release of information (ROI) request to the hospitals or treatment facilitys medical records department. Obtain health records and copies of all documentation related to the childs hospitalization. Obtain written information on the childs diagnosis and recommended treatment;  Enter the treatment provided in the childs Health Log. Share the childs health information with the placement resource and document that it was shared.  Document all activities in Georgia SHINES within 72 hours of occurrence. This includes updating Contacts and Summaries, the Health Detail and uploading health records to External Documentation. Include the following information: Discharge planning activities and documents;. Recommendations from the hospital or treatment facility regarding needed services and supports the child may need to be successful.PRACTICE GUIDANCECoordination with Caregivers During Hospitalization Caregiver involvement is essential throughout the hospitalization to ensure information sharing, success of treatment, appropriate post-hospital placement and provision of aftercare services. The SSCM should use every opportunity to gather information on the child and their caregiver while the child remains in the hospital. Ensure that sufficient time and opportunity is given to observe and evaluate the parent-child relationship. Observe the interaction between the child and the caregiver. Observe the caregivers response to the child, and their attention to the needs of the child. Assess the childs vulnerability and parental capacity to maintain the childs safety upon discharge from the hospital.Coordination with Hospitals when Children are in Foster Care When children in foster care require short-term, specialized hospitalization services to manage critical or immediate health or behavioral needs, it is important that DFCS staff is available and responsive to the hospital and treatment team providing care to the child. In some cases, family members are not available to participate in treatment and support activities. Consequently, DFCS has the responsibility to fill in the gaps and ensure full engagement in the treatment process. Collaboration with hospitals and healthcare providers ensures a seamless continuum of care for the child. Upon admission of a child to the hospital, the SSCM should coordinate with medical staff, participate in treatment when appropriate, and begin discharge planning in advance of the anticipated discharge date. Delay in planning can result in a disruption to the continuum of care for the child. Ensuring an appropriate placement option is available upon the childs release from the hospital is essential for a smooth transition from the hospital/treatment facility to the placement. Because a hospital setting is not intended to serve as a placement for a child, no child should remain in a hospital setting beyond the time that is medically necessary.DFCS State Office ResourcesChildrens Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA) Liaison The unique partnership between DFCS and CHOA continues to strengthen the response to children who have been alleged to be abused.

See Forms and Tools: Developmental Milestones for Children O-5. NOTE: For many children who enter foster care, indicators of developmental delays or other manifestations of trauma may not emerge for six months or more after the initial placement. Make another referral to Children 1st via the Children 1st Screening and Referral Form, by completing the form in Georgia SHINES and faxing/mailing to Children 1st when developmental delays are suspected or identified: Clearly document on the referral form that the case is being re-referred;  Specify the reason for re-referral, including the developmental delays suspected or identified since initial referral; and For children in foster care include the name, address and contact information for the new caregiver/surrogate and attach a copy of the court order, ROI-BCW, and FERPA forms signed by the new caregiver/surrogate. Document the following information in Georgia SHINES:Referral dates and childs Status of Eligibility (SOE) for BCW services;  Children 1st/BCW recommendations and referrals for services to address identified needs; Other identified needs and referrals for services to address these needs if the child is not eligible for BCW services; Participation in relevant meetings, ongoing follow-up, and monitoring of services; and Upload copies of BCW evaluations/reports and IFSPs to External Documentation.The Social Services Supervisor will: Ensure that all children who meet the eligibility criteria are referred to Babies Cant Wait. Ensure the Children 1st Screening and Referral Form is completed in Georgia SHINES and review it for accuracy and completeness prior to submission. Ensure that the childs caregiver signed the Authorization for Release of Information Form-BCW Specific (ROI-BCW) and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) Consent Form before the provision of services. Ensure the Children 1st Referral Form, ROI-BCW, and the FERPA forms are submitted to the Children 1st District Coordinator based on the protocol between DFCS and the local county health department in the county where the child resides. Verify the following: The date the Children 1st Screening and Referral Form was faxed or mailed to Children 1st.  The SSCM contacted the Children 1st District Coordinator to confirm receipt of the referral form. DFCS received a copy of the IFSP and Status of Eligibility (SOE) within 60 days of the date of the referral to Children 1st. DFCS received an Acknowledgement Letter within three days of the referral, if Children 1st referred the child to BCW.  The completion of the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Assessment by the caregiver, if the child is ineligible for BCW, but eligible to enroll in Children 1st. and enroll the child in Children 1st. The Status of Eligibility letter was forwarded to the primary SSCM, if the case was transferred to another program or SSCM.  Ensure the documentation identifies the specific reason for the referral to BCW (i.e. observed and/or reported developmental delays, a diagnosed disability, physical impairment, prenatal exposure to substances or an FASD, and/or involves a substantiated investigation). Ensure the SSCM is assessing child development on an ongoing basis to determine if any indicators of developmental delays or physical impairment were manifested later in the life of the case. Ensure a new referral to BCW is made when concerns are identified related to the developmental milestones for children 0-5. Ensure all documents are uploaded to Georgia SHINES within 72 hours of receipt.PRACTICE GUIDANCENotifications of Childrens 1st Referrals and Updates to Amerigroup, Rev Max, and DCH for Children in the Custody of DHS Amerigroup Notification Form (E-Form) DFCS communicates with Amerigroup, Rev Max, and DCH utilizing an electronic notification form (E-Form). It is the primary means for communicating information about a member enrolled in Georgia Families 360Ë. The E-Form must be completed and sent to Amerigroup, Rev Max, and DCH within 24 hours of a youth entering foster care. It should be completed thoroughly to include demographic information, medical information, placement information, the identified CCFA provider and other referrals (e.g., Babies Cant Wait). The E-Form is also used to report updates such as placement changes, a youth exiting care, etc. If there is information not available at the time of the initial referral to Amerigroup, submit an E-Form (update) as soon as the information is obtained. Accurate and timely communication with Amerigroup is vital to the Medicaid eligibility determination and the assignment of a CCT and service providers. Important decisions regarding the assignment of primary care providers and referrals are made based on the information submitted on the E-Form.Babies Cant Wait Babies Can't Wait (BCW) is Georgia's statewide interagency service delivery system for infants and toddlers with developmental delays or disabilities and their families. The Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) is the lead agency administering the Babies Can't Wait (BCW) Program in Georgia. DPH ensures: Services are provided in accordance with federal guidelines. Families have access to the services that are needed to enhance their child's development. Training is available to ensure that professionals who work with children and families have up to date information.BCW serves Georgia children from birth up to their third birthday, regardless of income, who meet one of the following criteria: Have a diagnosed physical or mental condition which is known to result in a developmental delay, such as blindness, Down syndrome, or Spina Bifida; or Have a diagnosed developmental delay confirmed by a qualified team of professionals.For children in foster care referred to BCW, the BCW Service Coordinator will contact the foster/surrogate parent for consent and conduct an assessment. The BCW Service Coordinator will also develop a primary service provider (PSP) team that includes the SSCM and the CCT. The PSP team will: Have the licensed provider on the primary service provider team submit the prior authorization request to the CMO to conduct a full developmental evaluation. Develop the IFSP to identify services. Send SOE letter to DFCS within 60 days of the BCW referral notifying DFCS that services will be provided. Send IFSP evaluation report to DFCS. NOTE: BCW will notify DFCS in writing if a caregiver of a child declines participation with the BCW process and procedures and will provide the reason given by the caregiver for refusal of servicesChildren 1st Children 1st is a Georgia Department of Public Health program which promotes the healthy development of young children [birth to five years old] and assures that they arrive at school healthy and ready for success. Children 1st is the single point of entry to a statewide collaborative system of Public Health and other prevention-based programs and services. This system helps caregivers provide their young children with a healthy start in life. It allows at-risk children to be identified early and gives them a chance to grow up healthy and ready for school. Children 1st collaborates with local hospitals, pediatricians and other health care providers, schools, community-based organizations and other agencies to ensure the healthy development of newborns and young children. Children 1st completes developmental screenings and refers families to other public health programs, including Babies Can't Wait (BCW). If a child is found ineligible for BCW, DFCS refers the child back to Children 1st for appropriate monitoring and follow-up. Informed written consent from the parent or legal guardian is required.What Happens After DFCS Makes a Referral to Children 1st Category 1 Referral When Children 1st receives a referral from DFCS, they request a faxed copy of the most current standardized developmental screening results (if DFCS has one on file) within 24 hours of receipt of the referral. The Children 1st referral completed by DFCS is sent to BCW within two business days of when criteria are met. The referral is sent to the next staffing of the Birth to Five Review Team (BCW, Children 1st, 1st Care, Childrens Medical Services (CMS), and Universal Newborn 1st Care (formerly known as High-Risk Infant Follow-Up). This is a nurse case management service provided through Children 1st that is designed to provide services to infants who are very low birth weight or are low birth weight and have medical/health conditions.Hearing Screening and Intervention Coordinator (UNHSI) to determine the most appropriate Public Health program referral(s). Category 2 Referral The Developmental Specialist or other trained DPH staff will initiate contact with the family within three business days. Once contact has been made with the family, a home visit will be scheduled to gain consent to screen the childs development using the appropriate Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ-3)1 or the Ages and Stages Questionnaire Social and Emotional (ASQ-SE)2 . If the screening indicates possible developmental delays, then Children 1st will send the referral along with the ASQ-E or ASQ-SE to BCW within two business days. If the screening indicates that the child is age appropriate or in the monitoring zone, the Children 1st Developmental Specialist or Registered Nurse will offer to enroll the child in Children 1st and complete the Maternal Child Health Integrated Assessment.Developmental Delay Developmental Delay is a chronological delay in the appearance of normal developmental milestones achieved during infancy and early childhood, adjusted for prematurity in one or more of the following areas: cognitive, physical (including vision and hearing), communication, social/emotional and adaptive. Developmental delays may be caused by organic, psychological or environmental factors. For example, if most children crawl by eight months of age and walk by the middle of the second year, then a child five or six months behind schedule in reaching these milestones may be classified as developmentally delayed regarding mobility.Disability A disability means a child has a diagnosed physical or mental condition that has a high probability of resulting in a developmental delay (e.g., Down syndrome, autism, cerebral palsy). Early Intervention Services Early intervention services are interventions designed to meet the developmental needs of children age birth to three who have or are at risk of developmental delays. Developmental services are provided in several areas, including physical, cognitive, communication, social-emotional and adaptive functioning. Caregivers of children receiving early intervention services receive education and support to assist them in understanding and enhancing their child's development.Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP) The IFSP is a written plan for providing early intervention supports and services to eligible children/families. It is developed jointly by the family, service coordinator and other appropriate, qualified personnel providing early intervention services. The IFSP is based on a multidisciplinary evaluation and assessment of the child and the strengths and needs of the childs family. The IFSP includes developmental outcomes, strategies, activities and services necessary to meet the IFSP outcomes, to enhance the development of the child, and to meet the special needs of the child.Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) IDEA includes specific provisions to ensure that all children with disabilities have a parent to act on their behalf. Per Section 602(23) of the IDEA of 2004, a parent is:  A natural, adoptive or foster parent of a child (unless a foster parent is prohibited by state law from serving as a parent). A guardian (but not the state if the child is a ward of the state). An individual acting in the place of a natural or adoptive parent, including a grandparent, stepparent or another relative with whom the child lives or a person who is legally responsible for the childs welfare. An individual assigned to be a surrogate parent, in accordance with Babies Cant Wait Standards.Physical Impairment A physical impairment is defined as a dysfunction of the musculoskeletal and/or neurological body systems, which affects the ability of an individual to move or coordinate movement. This includes one or more of the following body systems: neurological, musculoskeletal, sensory organs, respiratory (including speech organs), cardiovascular, reproductive, digestive, genital, urinary, hemic and lymphatic, skin and endocrine. A physical impairment on its own does not make a child eligible for BCW, but if there is a significant developmental delay due to the physical impairment then the child may be eligible.Plan of Safe Care and Prenatal Exposure to Substances The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) requires that healthcare providers identify and make appropriate referrals to DFCS of infants affected by prenatal drug exposure or a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder; and that plans for safe care (safety, family and case plans that promote health and well-being) be developed for infants and families.). This identification of affected may occur during any stage of DFCS involvement, including at birth, or later during the infants development and/or as symptoms manifest. The Plan of Safe Care that is created will address actions and services to address the infants and familys needs, and these needs must be incorporated into the case plan/action plan when developed. The developmental screening by Children 1st is an important component of the assessment of needs for infants and determining services needed as part of the development and implementation of the plan of safe care. See policy 19.27 Case Management: Plan of Safe Care for Infants Prenatally Exposed to Substances or a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder [FASD]Surrogate Parent A surrogate parent is an individual who has been appointed to represent a child in all matters related to BCW early intervention services. A surrogate parents responsibility is to ensure that the child is provided with appropriate early intervention services under Part C of IDEA. The surrogate parent has the right to make decisions relating to the development and implementation of the childs IFSP, including evaluation, assessment, ongoing provision of services, annual evaluations and periodic reviews and any other rights established under Part C regulations. Appointment as a surrogate parent does not mean the surrogate parent has authority over care and maintenance, financial support of the child, custody of the child, foster home placement or any other matters that are not directly related to BCW early intervention services. The surrogate parent must always act in a manner that he/she believes is in the best interest of the child. A surrogate parent is not liable to the child for damages that result from any act or omission in representing the child in decisions relating to participation in early intervention. The surrogate parent would be liable for gross or willful acts of negligence or misconduct. A surrogate parent shall not be an employee of the state lead agency or other state agency and shall not be any person or any employee of a person providing early intervention services. A surrogate parent must:Be a citizen of the United States, a resident of the state of Georgia and above the age of 18.Have no interest that conflicts with the interests of the child represented. Have sufficient knowledge and skill to ensure adequate representation of the child. Have time and desire to become involved in the early intervention process. Possess an understanding of the cultural and linguistic background of the child he/she represents.Activities performed by a surrogate parent include: Visiting the child and observing the childs development and environment, as appropriate. Attending the childs evaluations and assessments as appropriate. Participating in the development of the childs IFSP. Participating in the development of the annual IFSPs and reviews. Reviewing the childs BCW record to become familiar with the child and as needed. Exercising independent judgment in pursuing the childs interests within early interventions. Representing the child within the BCW Early Intervention System.A surrogate must be appointed to ensure that the rights of eligible children are protected if: No parent can be identified in accordance with Section 602(23); After reasonable efforts, the whereabouts of the parent cannot be discovered; or The child is a ward of the state pursuant to Georgia state law.NOTE: A surrogate parent can be assigned to a child in foster care once that child is in DFCS custody and before the court has terminated parental rights. In Georgia, a foster parent may be appointed as a childs surrogate parent since there is no conflict of interest between the foster parent and child since the foster parent has the requisite knowledge and skills to adequately represent the child. Foster parents are not deemed employees of DFCS, but rather DFCS agents. If a foster parent meets the criteria, he or she may be considered the parent and there is no need for the appointment of a surrogate parent. When there is a foster parent, the BCW Coordinator is still responsible for ensuring that a copy of the court order stating that DFCS has legal custody of the child is maintained in the BCW record. The DFCS SSCM is responsible for providing a copy of the juvenile court order appointing DFCS as temporary legal custodian of a child to BCW each time a child is referred to BCW. When a foster parent serves as the parent, the foster parent has the authority to sign the IFSP and all related documents, forms and releases. The DFCS SSCM should sign the IFSP document as a participating team member (not the parent) and should participate in the development and implementation of the IFSP. If a foster parent is unwilling to serve as the parent, a surrogate parent must be appointed. When the surrogate and foster parent are different, the ultimate decision related to the provision of BCW early intervention services is determined by the surrogate parent. A person acting in the place of a parent, such as a grandparent or a stepparent with whom the child lives or a person who is legally responsible for the childs welfare, may be considered the childs parent under IDEA. Before assuming a grandparent or relative is the parent under IDEA, the BCW Coordinator must interview the person and document that the child lives with the individual and that this person is responsible for the childs day-to-day care. It is understood that any time there is someone acting in the place of the parent and if the parent returns, all rights immediately revert to the parent (as long as the parental rights have not been terminated through the court system). A person whose role is a caregiver and whose contact is only incidental (e.g., babysitter, childcare worker) cannot assume the responsibility of a parent. Significant Developmental Delay A significant delay is identified through the informed clinical opinion of the Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT). A delay is considered significant when it interferes with the childs ability to achieve expected developmental milestones of cognitive, communication, adaptive, physical, social, or emotional development. These delays are so significant that ongoing development for the child is compromised. Secondary delays relative to the initial delay are also likely to occur (e.g., because of significant delays in expressive communication, social skills with peers are jeopardized). Criteria include identification of deficits in skills that are prerequisite to or instrumental in accomplishing later developing skills or functional tasks that would be expected of peers who are developing typically. If the use of standardized diagnostic measures is deemed appropriate, a score of two standard deviations below the mean in one of the five developmental domains or at least 1.5 standard deviations below the mean in two or more of the five developmental domains constitutes a significant delay through the informed clinical opinion of the MDT.FORMS AND TOOLSAuthorization for Release of Information - Babies Cant Wait SpecificAuthorization for Release of Information - Babies Cant Wait Specific (Spanish)Developmental Milestones for Children 0-5Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) Consent FormFamily Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) Consent Form (Spanish)",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-19-case-management-section-1928-children-1st-and-babies-cant

A Plan of Safe Care is a process that involves a multi-agency partnership with families to develop a written plan for families affected by prenatal exposure to substances and/or alcohol, that: Ensures the safety and well-being of infants following release from the care of healthcare providers; Addresses the health and substance use disorder treatment needs of the infant and affected family or caregiver; Ensures the provision of services to address the identified needs of the infant, family and caregiver; Monitors the plan to ensure services are addressing the identified needs. The Plan of Safe Care incorporates into one document the plans from various agencies providing services to the family, such as the child welfare assessment, hospital discharge plan, substance use treatment case plan and prenatal care plan to address the medical, behavioral, developmental, social and emotional well-being of the family. Coordinated services to the family ensures timely access to a continuum of care, minimizes barriers to accessing care, improves infant and maternal outcomes, and facilitates identification of the familys overall needs and engagement into the appropriate services.When is a Plan of Safe Care Required The Plan of Safe Care is required when a healthcare provider has identified that an infant has been affected by substance abuse; or withdrawal symptoms resulting from prenatal drug exposure; or a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder. This identification may occur during any stage of DFCS involvement, including at birth, or later during the infants development and/or as symptoms manifest. DFCS may develop the Plan of Safe Care prior to the birth of an infant, if child welfare is providing services due to other children in the home and the family agrees.While prenatal exposure may include cases with child maltreatment (prenatal abuse) not all cases requiring a Plan of Safe Care involve maltreatment. Some examples of cases involving prenatal exposure with no allegations of maltreatment are as follows: The infant is prenatally exposed resulting from the mothers use of prescribed medication for an illness. The mother is following her medication and treatment plan, as verified by her healthcare provider. The infant is prenatally exposed resulting from the mother being given prescribed medication during the delivery process. The infant is prenatally exposed due to the mothers participation in a Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) program for a substance use disorder. The mother is in compliance with her medication and treatment plan, as verified by the substance treatment provider and her healthcare provider.Prenatal Exposure  Affected An infant affected by prenatal exposure to substance use means: The infant is experiencing symptoms of withdrawal, or exhibiting harmful effects in his/her physical appearance or functioning due to exposure to substances (legal or illegal); or The infant has tested positive for the presence of a substance or a metabolite thereof in his/her body, blood, urine or meconium; or The infant has symptoms of a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder; or The mother testing positive for illegal substances at the birth of the infant; or The mother testing positive for prescription drugs due to misuse at the birth of the infant; or  The mother self-disclosed at the birth of the infant a substance or alcohol use problem and use during pregnancy.Prenatal Exposure and Infant Development The full impact of prenatal substance exposure depends on several factors, including: the frequency of use during pregnancy, timing, the type of substances used by pregnant women, co-occurring environmental deficiencies, and the extent of prenatal care (AIA, 2012). The effects of parental substance use disorders on a child can begin before the child is born. Research suggests powerful effects of legal drugs, as well as illegal drugs on prenatal and early childhood development (HHS SAMHSA, 2014). Maternal drug and alcohol use during pregnancy have been associated with premature birth, low birth weight, slowed growth, and a variety of physical, emotional, behavioral, and cognitive problems (AIA, 2012; National Institute on Drug Abuse [NIDA], 2011). Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are a set of conditions that affect an estimated 40,000 infants born each year to mothers who drank alcohol during pregnancy (Prevention First, n.d.). Children with FASD may experience mild to severe physical, mental, behavioral, and/or learning disabilities, some of which may have lifelong implications (e.g., brain damage, physical defects, attention deficits) (National Organization on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, 2012). Research suggests that some of the negative outcomes of prenatal exposure can be improved by supportive home environments and positive parenting practices (NIDA, 2011). Symptoms of FASD can include facial abnormalities, growth deficiencies, skeletal deformities, organ deformities, central nervous system handicaps and behavioral problems. These symptoms can have lifelong implications for children who were exposed to alcohol in the womb; however, some FASD children who receive special education and adequate social services are more likely to reach their developmental and educational potential than those who do not receive those services. FASD diagnostic conditions include: Type I: Fetal Alcohol Syndrome with confirmed maternal exposure. Type II: FAS without confirmed maternal exposure. Type III: Alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD)  Type IV: Alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND).Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), formerly known as withdrawal symptoms, may occur when a pregnant woman takes drugs such as heroin, codeine, oxycodone (OxyContin), methadone or buprenorphine. Because the baby is no longer getting the drug after birth, the withdrawal may occur as the drug is slowly cleared from the baby's system. Symptoms may appear within a few hours of birth to 14 days after birth, and depend on the type of substance used, length of time used, etc. Symptoms generally include but is not limited to, blotchy skin coloring (mottling), diarrhea. excessive crying or high-pitched crying, excessive sucking, fever. hyperactive reflexes, increased muscle tone, irritability, poor feeding, rapid breathing, seizures, sleep problems, slow weight gain, stuffy nose, sneezing, sweating, trembling (tremors), vomiting.Prenatal Exposure and Child and Adolescent Development Children and youth of parents who use or abuse substances and have parenting difficulties have an increased chance of experiencing a variety of negative outcomes (Felitti et al., 1998; HHS, 1999; Staton-Tindall et al., 2013) including: poor cognitive, social, and emotional development, depression, anxiety, and other trauma and mental health symptoms, physical and health issues, and substance use problems. Parental substance use can affect the well-being of children and youth in complex ways. For example, an infant who receives inconsistent care and nurturing from a parent engaged in addiction-related behaviors may suffer from attachment difficulties that can then interfere with the growing childs emotional development. Adolescent children of parents with substance use disorders, particularly those who have experienced child maltreatment and foster care, may turn to substances themselves as a coping mechanism. In addition, children of parents with substance use issues are more likely to experience trauma and its effects, which include difficulties with concentration and learning, controlling physical and emotional responses to stress, and forming trusting relationships (Staton-Tindall et al., 2013).Considerations for Developing and Implementing Plans of Safe Care When developing, and implementing the Plan of Safe Care, consider the following: The post-partum period is a time of unique vulnerability for the mother due to:  Increased stress associated with motherhood, infant care, sleep deprivation Limited social support and resource availability Increased financial demands Pain and physical recovery from deliveryPhysiologic transition from pregnant to non-pregnant stateAlcohol and substances cause significant changes in brain chemistry, which affects a persons mood, thinking, behavior and perception. It can be difficult for a person to follow through on scheduling and keeping appointments; therefore, it is essential that Social Services Case Managers assist families with making and keeping appointments or identify a responsible person to assist the family. The mothers or fathers child welfare-related history that indicates unresolved substance use disorders related to a prior case of child abuse or neglect; Any prior abuse and/or neglect reports related to substance use and response to agency intervention or substance abuse treatment; Whether any siblings have been prenatally exposed to substances or have been exposed in the home or family environment; Evidence of co-occurring mental health concerns that may affect immediate parenting capacity such as post-partum depression and substance use; The mothers willingness to seek treatment and parenting instruction; Family environmental challenges due to parental substance use disorders; and Access to sufficient income/resources, employment, and lack of access to a medical home can all interact with substance use disorders, and could impact the infant.What to include in the Plan of Safe Care Needs of the mother: Health care Identification by the mother of a consistent and stable primary caregiver Medication management Pain management Breast Feeding, if recommended by the physician. Substance use and mental health, should include the following: Timely access  Engagement, retention and recovery supports Appropriate treatment (i.e. gender-specific, family focused, accessible, medication assisted treatment, trauma responsive) Depression/anxiety/domestic violence Identify and assist the mother in accessing the appropriate assessments and treatment services. Parenting/Family Support: Coordinated case management/home visits to assess/address infant care, parent/infant bonding, nurturing, mothers understanding of the special care needs of the infant(s) and ability to provide such care, parenting guidance and skill development, safe sleep practices, and maternal support. Child Care Benefits/Eligibility Determination Employment support HousingTransportationSupportive network (having relationships and social networks that provide support, friendship, love, and hope)Needs of the Infant: Healthcare Identification of a consistent pediatrician/healthcare provider Referral to specialty care, as indicated High-risk follow-up care Safety with the caregivers Developmental screening and assessment Linkage to Early Intervention Services Early care and education program Needs of other children in the home: Identification of a consistent pediatrician/healthcare provider Safety with the caregivers Developmental screening and assessment  Linkage to Early Intervention Services e. Early care and education program Needs of other family members: Substance use disorder assessment and treatment Mental health assessment and treatment Pain management Medication management Parenting skills (i.e. bonding, nurturing, understanding of the special care needs of the infant and the ability to provide it, safe sleep practice, etc.) Their ability to meet the care and protection needs of the infant and any other children living in the home.Monitoring the Plan of Safe Care Ensuring the services identified in the Plan of Safe Care is implemented is critical to assuring the ongoing health and substance abuse needs of the infant and family. The Plan of Safe Care will address actions and services for the infant and familys needs that support the family achieving long-term recovery. Therefore, the needs must be incorporated into the case plan if the case is transferred to Family Preservation Services or Foster Care to ensure ongoing monitoring. If the family does not continue child welfare services with DFCS, another individual or agency must be identified to monitor the plan of safe care. This could be the medical provider, Babies Cant Wait or other providers already involved with the family and who can obtain information to monitor the plan. Plan of Safe Care vs. Safety Plan A Plan of Safe Care is different from a safety plan aimed at addressing present or impending danger situations that have already occurred.4 A safety plan is designed to control safety threats and have an immediate effect, and stays in effect as long as the threats to child safety exist and the family remains unable to provide for the childs safety.5 The Plan of Safe Care moves beyond the immediate safety factors to the ongoing health, treatment and well-being needs of the infant and family. Therefore, it can remain in effect even when a comprehensive assessment indicates there is no need for child welfare services or after the termination of child welfare services.Five-Point Intervention Framework Since many Substance Exposed Infants (SEI) are not identified prenatally or at birth, an approach that addresses all stages of development for the affected child is critical. Most previous work related to SEIs has focused on pregnancy and the birth event. However, a more comprehensive view is needed that takes multiple intervention opportunities into account, beginning with prepregnancy and continuing throughout a childs developmental milestones. The framework around which this report is organized asserts that there are five major timeframes when intervention in the life of the SEI can reduce the potential harm of prenatal substance exposure: Pre-pregnancy: This timeframe offers the opportunity to promote awareness of the effects of prenatal substance use among women of childbearing age and their family members; Prenatal: This intervention point encourages health care providers to screen pregnant women for substance use as part of routine prenatal care and make referrals that facilitate access to treatment and related services for women who need those services; Birth: Interventions during this timeframe incorporate testing newborns for substance exposure at the time of delivery; Neonatal: Developmental assessment and the corresponding provision of services for the newborn as well as the family at this intervention point, immediately after the birth event, are the emphasis; and Throughout childhood and adolescence: This timeframe calls for ongoing provision of coordinated services for both child and family.FORMS AND TOOLSAuthorization for Release of InformationAuthorization for Release of Information (Spanish)Know Your Rights: Rights for Individuals on Medication-Assisted TreatmentPlan of Safe Care",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-19-case-management-section-1927-plan-safe-care-infants

Upload a copy of the drug screen results and any other relevant forms (referral, ROI, etc.) into Georgia SHINES External Documentation.PRACTICE GUIDANCEDrug Screens Drug screening refers to the use of various biologic sources, such as urine, saliva, sweat, hair, breath, blood, and meconium to determine the presence of specific substances or their metabolites in an individuals system. Timing is a crucial factor in drug and alcohol screening. The amount of time a drug remains in the body is dependent on a variety of factors including the amount of drug taken and the metabolism of the individual. A negative drug screen result does not always mean there are no drugs present in the person being tested, it means there are not drugs present in the sample tested above the cut off limit. There is no form of screening that can absolutely guarantee that an individual is not using drugs. A provider or facilitys drug screening procedures should differentiate between legitimate therapeutic drug use and illegal drug use or misuse. The screens should rule out legal medications that individuals use for legitimate medical reasons before declaring a drug screen result to be positive. A Medical Review Officer (a licensed physician who reviews and interprets lab results) can assist with interpreting the results1. For a list of commonly abused drugs and their effects see Forms and Tools: Commonly Abused Drugs & Their Effects.Covered entities [under federal disability rights laws] are not prohibited from drug testing designed to ensure that a person who formerly engaged in the illegal use of drugs is no longer currently engaged in the illegal use of drugs. In other words, federal disability rights laws do not prohibit a covered entity from conducting drug testingUsing Drugs Screens in Case Assessment and Case Planning Social Services Case Managers have the opportunity to collect relevant information about family functioning, make informed decisions, and take timely and appropriate action to safeguard children, when a caregiver is unable to do so. Drug and alcohol use may impair a parent/guardian/legal custodians judgment and therefore interfere with their ability to provide proper care and control of their child. Drug screens should not be approached with a focus on trying to catch a parent/guardian/legal custodian using drugs or alcohol. Rather, it should be used as part of the comprehensive assessment process to help the parent/guardian/legal custodian identify whether he/she is developing or has an alcohol or substance use problem, and whether they need treatment or how are progressing in treatment. This approach will encourage parents/caregivers to be honest about their substance or alcohol use including lapses or relapses in their recovery and seek assistance. Further, the use of the drug screen may help staff to identify the condition(s) that may be impacting the caregivers parental functioning. However, drug screens alone do not provide sufficient information for making decisions about the disposition of a case (i.e. substantiating allegations of child abuse or neglect, child removal, family reunification or termination of parental rights). When determining whether a child is in present or impending danger due to the parents/guardians/legal custodians substance abuse it is important to use a combination of screening and assessment processes that include a family functioning assessment, collaboration with substance abuse treatment providers and medical professionals, clinical instruments, random drug screens, self-reports, and observations of behavioral indicators (see policy 19.26 Case Management: Case Management Involving Substance Abuse or Use).Appropriate Uses for Drug and Alcohol Screens include: As one component of a case assessment when there are indicators that substance and alcohol use is a contributing factor to maltreatment; To assist a parent/guardian/legal custodian in their readiness for treatment interventions; When substance and alcohol use is a contributing factor in maltreatment and the parent is not participating in a substance abuse treatment program; To provide positive reinforcement and to monitor parents, particularly in early recovery.Obtaining Drug Screens for Parents/Caregivers in Treatment When a parent/guardian/legal custodian is actively participating in a substance or alcohol treatment program and in compliance with their treatment plan that includes random drug screening, the SSCM should coordinate with the substance or alcohol treatment provider to obtain the drug screen results.Lapse vs. Relapse There is a difference between having one slip and having a relapse. A lapse represents a temporary slip or return to a previous behavior that one is trying to control or quit (usually a one time occurrence). A relapse represents a full-blown return to a pattern of behavior that one has been trying to moderate or quit altogether. The SSCM should assess the positive drug screen along with other indicators (such as a change in behavior or appearance, missed appointments, failure to through, etc.) to determine the potential impact on the childs safety (see policy 19.26 Case Management: Case Management Involving Substance Abuse or Use).Full Disclosure / Informed ConsentThe SSCM has the responsibility to disclose all significant information about drug screens to parents/caregivers including the implications of completing drug screens such as the drug screen may be presented as evidence if legal action is necessary. Also, the SSCM should explain the benefits of completing drug screens such as to assist with evaluating their physical, psychological and social well-being and evaluating progress in substance abuse treatment and recovery. When requesting a drug screen, avoid using statements that can be perceived as coercive or punitive. Statements to avoid include: If you dont agree to testing, Ill have no choice but to remove your children, or Ill limit your visitation with your children. Unless drug screens are mandated by court order or other legal requirements, individuals have the right to choose whether to participate in the drug screens. Three conditions must be met before a decision can be considered fully informed: Capacity: The individual can make rational decisions. Comprehension: Information must be provided in a way that the individual understands, including language and words the individual understands. The individual should be asked to repeat her/his understanding of the information, so it is assured things were fully understood and fill in whatever gaps exist. Voluntariness: Implies that the individual is free to make this choice and is acting without any coercion. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)CocaineOpiatesPhencyclidine (PCP)AmphetaminesBenzodiazepinesBarbituratesMethadonePropoxypheneEthyl Glucuronide (EtG)Oxycodone3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine(MDA)6 Panel (Oral Fluid)ï¸ï¸ï¸ï¸ï¸ï¸      7 Panel (Urine)ï¸ï¸ï¸ï¸ï¸ï¸ï¸     7 Panel (Hair)ï¸ï¸ï¸ï¸ï¸ï¸     ï¸12 Panel (Urine)ï¸ï¸ï¸ï¸ï¸ï¸ï¸ï¸ï¸ï¸ï¸ï¸Urine Synthetic Cannabinoids  A urine panel comprised of over 40 synthetic cannabinoid metabolites, including substances such as Spice, K2, etc. (must be court ordered)Urine Synthetic Stimulants  A urine panel comprised of over 60 synthetic stimulant metabolites, including substances such as Bath Salts, Flakka, etc. (must be court ordered)Urine Kratom  A urine panel comprised of Mitragynine and 7 Hydroxymitragynine (must be court ordered)NOTES Always verify with the vendor or facility the substances included in the drug panel. THC mind-altering (psychoactive) commonly known as marijuana and cannabis. Cocaine is a euphoria-producing stimulant drug. Commonly known as Coca, Coke, Crack, Flake and Snow. Opiates is a narcotic, commonly known as Heroin, Big H, Black Tar, Chiva, Hell Dust, Horse, Negra and Smack. Phencyclidine (PCP) is a mind-altering drug. PCP is in a class of drugs called hallucinogens (substances that cause hallucinations). Amphetamines are stimulants and many are legally prescribed and used to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Commonly known as crank, ice, speed, uppers, meth, bennies, black beauties. Benzodiazepines are psychoactive drugs used to treat panic attacks, generalized anxiety, seizures, and alcohol withdrawal. Commonly known as Valium, Xanax Barbiturates are a sedative-hypnotic drug, used to decrease anxiety and fight insomnia. Known commonly as downers. Methadone can be abused as a pain reliever and can cause extreme exhaustion and numbness.  Propoxyphene, also known as Darvon, is a narcotic pain reliever and is highly addictive. EtG test is used to detect the presence of ethyl glucuronide, breakdown of ethanol (alcohol). MDA acts as both a stimulant and psychedelic commonly used by adolescents and young adults. Commonly known as Sally, Sass. MDA is the parent drug of MDMA (commonly known as E, Ecstasy, X, Molly).Urine Toxicology Detection Periods for Different Substances Most substances of abuse can be detected for approximately 2 to 4 days, the higher the dose taken and the more frequently the substance has been used over an extended time, the more likely that it will be detected. Although substances are excreted at various rates, they accumulate in the body with continued use. Whereas a single use of cocaine may be detectable in urine for only a day or less, continued daily use is likely to be detectable for 2 to 3 days following its discontinuation. Chronic use of such drugs as marijuana, PCP, and benzodiazepines may be detectable for up to 30 days, whereas alcohol remains in the system for 24 hours or less. Realistically, it may be difficult to detect illicit substances in most clients who stop all use for several days before a drug screen. An accurate profile of a client's substance use over more than a few days requires both urine test results and a good retrospective history.SubstanceTypical Urine Detection PeriodAmphetamine or methamphetamine2  4 daysBarbiturates Short-actingSecobarbital1  2 days Long-actingPentobarbital 2  4 daysPhenobarbital10  20 daysBenzodiazepines Therapeutic dose3  7 daysChronic dosingUp to 30 daysCocaine1  3 daysCannabinoids/THC Casual use1  3 daysDaily use5  10 daysChronic useUp to 30 daysEthanol (alcohol)12  24 hoursOpioids (e.g., codeine, morphine)1  3 daysMethadone2  4 daysPropoxyphene6  48 hoursMDMA1  5 daysPCP Acute use2  7 daysChronic useUp to 30 daysCommonly Used Medication for Medication Assisted Treatment MAT encompasses treatment for drug and alcohol addiction with other medications and psychotherapies.Medications for Alcohol Dependence Medications for Opioid DependenceNaltrexone: (ReVia®, Vivitrol®, Depade) Disulfiram: (Antabuse®) Acamprosate: (Campral®)Methadone: Methadose®, Dolophine®;10 Buprenorphine: (Suboxone® and Subutex®) Naltrexone: (ReVia®, Vivitrol®, Depade ®)FORMS AND TOOLSCommonly Abused DrugsCommon Drug Testing TopicsKnow Your Rights: Rights for Individuals on Medication-Assisted TreatmentPros and Cons of Different Specimen SourcesThe Effects of Substance of Abuse on Behavior and Parenting",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-19-case-management-section-1925-drug-screens
GA :: Child Welfare Policy Manual :: Chapter 19 Case Management :: Section 19.23 Paternity Testing,Georgia,Rules,2023,"Administrative process, Birth parents, Investigations",,,"REQUIREMENTS The Division of Family and Children Services (DFCS) shall: Initiate deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) paternity testing, when appropriate, to determine/ verify biological fathers and paternal relatives, to inform and/or support child welfare decision making regarding safety planning, case planning, placement, and permanency. NOTE: DNA paternity testing provides scientific evidence of paternity by comparing the genetic markers from the child's DNA with those of the alleged father. DNA testing may be initiated whenever a biological father cannot be conclusively identified by other methods, and establishment of paternity is needed to support safety planning, case planning, placement, and permanency. Refer individuals for DNA paternity testing: When ordered by court; To identify/verify biological relationships for placement and permanency for children in foster care, or termination of parental rights (TPR); During family preservation services, if needed (e.g., to identify paternal relatives such as grandparents, or to identify biological fathers if paternity may be in doubt); To prevent the placement of a child into foster care; Other situations, as needed. Complete a service authorization to initiate DNA paternity collection and testing.  Use only approved vendors for DNA paternity testing. Obtain a court order to: Conduct DNA paternity testing for incarcerated alleged parents. Use available DNA samples from the medical examiner, funeral home, coroner, etc., if a DNA sample from an alleged parent is not available (e.g., due to them being deceased). Determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether to initiate a family case study when a DNA sample is not available from an alleged parent: Consult with the Contract Director and/or the Regional Webmaster before initiating a family case study as each family circumstances are unique. Family case studies are not recommended for uncooperative parties, such as a father refusing to have the DNA paternity test. In these situations, a petition to the court to order the DNA paternity test may be appropriate. NOTE: A family case study is done by testing two or more biological family members of the alleged parent, as well as the mother of the child. Document all requests for DNA paternity testing and results in Georgia SHINES within 72 hours of occurrence. Adhere to confidentiality and Health Insurance Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) provisions outlined in policies 2.6 Information Management: Confidentiality/Safeguarding Information and 2.5 Information Management: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.PROCEDURESThe Social Services Case Manager (SSCM) will: Initiate DNA paternity testing: Complete a service authorization: Date service authorizations to allow a minimum of 30 days if collection will be done by a DFCS staff. Date service authorizations to allow a minimum of 90 days if collection will be done through a vendor. NOTE: All collections require a valid updated service authorization. Use funding source PUP (see policy 18.3 Support Services to Prevent or Reunify Families: Prevention of Unnecessary Placement (PUP) and the COSTAR Manual. List all parties needing testing in the persons referred section; and Obtain approval from the Social Services Supervisor (SSS). Email the request for DNA collection and testing to the DNA Collector. Attach a copy of the approved service authorization to the email. EXCEPTION: The DNA collection and testing request must be made directly to the Regional Webmaster rather than the DNA Collector for an incarcerated alleged parent, an alleged parent being deceased, or out-of-state requests. If the alleged parent is incarcerated, email the request for DNA collection and testing to the Regional Webmaster. Include the following: An approved service authorization dated with a minimum of 90 days of coverage;A court order for paternity testing collection on the incarcerated alleged parent; The Inmate Number and prison contact, if available. If the alleged parent is deceased and a DNA sample is needed from the medical examiner, funeral home, or coroners office, etc., e-mail the request for DNA collection and testing to the Regional Webmaster. Include the following: An approved service authorization dated with a minimum of 90 days of coverage; A court order authorizing the testing vendor to collect the sample from the named facility. NOTE: If a DNA sample for a deceased alleged parent is not available from above sources, consult with the Regional Webmaster or Contract Director to determine the appropriateness of initiating a family case study. If the alleged parent or family member lives in another state (out-of-state requests):Email the request for DNA collection and testing to Regional Webmaster. Include an approved service authorization dated with a minimum of 90 days of coverage; The Regional Webmaster will arrange for the DNA Collector to conduct DNA collection and testing for the child in Georgia. NOTE: Consult with the Regional Webmaster for paternity testing from other countries.Provide the child and parents timely notification of their DNA collection appointment(s). Upon receipt of the DNA paternity test results from the Regional Webmaster: In conjunction with the SSS, review the results to determine how the results impact case decision making. Discuss the results to the alleged parent.  Document all requests for DNA paternity testing and results in Georgia SHINES: Upload the results to External Documentation within 72 hours of receipt. If paternity is established: Select Paternity Established Checkbox in Person Detail; Change the relationship from Putative to Biological Father. NOTE: Establishing paternity through DNA paternity testing does not mean that the child has been legitimated. Refer to policy 17.15 Legal: Legitimation for the legitimation process.The DNA Collector will: Collect DNA samples. NOTE: Samples may be collected at the DFCS office, the individuals home, or the court. Consider collector safety when determining location for sample collection. Follow guidelines for submitting pictures, including: On a blank sheet of paper: Write the individuals full name, date of birth, date, and obtain the signature of the individual being tested; Place DNA Collectors initials.  Have the individual hold the paper to take the picture; Take a picture with an approved camera. Update records of collection and shipment to the vendor on the Well-Being Paternity SharePoint website. Share DNA collection and testing information with the Regional Webmaster via WellBeing Paternity SharePoint site or email. NOTE: DNA collectors may be any DFCS staff identified by the county, including but not limited to SSCMs and Office Support staff. However, to avoid any perception of conflict of interest, the childs parent and/or guardian or assigned SSCM cannot serve as the DNA collector.The Regional Webmaster will: Schedule collections for incarcerated alleged parents, deceased alleged parents, out-of-state request with approved DNA vendors. Order all DNA supplies. Provide the SSCM and SSS the DNA paternity test results. Process invoices. Initiate family case studies with the Contract Manager, as needed. Review and update the DFCS Well Being Support Services SharePoint site to reflect any changes to the DNA Collection process, such as changes to DNA Collectors. Track DNA collector activity, including missing DNA specimens. Serve as a resource for DNA Collectors and county staff on DNA paternity testing concerns.The SSS will: Provide guidance to the SSCM regarding when and how to seek DNA paternity testing.  Review the service authorization to ensure it is accurate, completed timely and allows for the appropriate coverage time based on the case circumstances prior to approval. Consult with other county/regional leadership where appropriate, or in accordance with any established county/regional protocols. Ensure referrals to DNA Collectors and Regional Webmaster are completed timely and according to the established processes.  Ensure that the SSCM requests court orders when needed for DNA paternity testing. Participate in family case study consultations. Review paternity testing results with the SSCM, including discussing how the results impact case decision making.PRACTICE GUIDANCEDNA Paternity Testing The most common DNA paternity sample type is a buccal swab. This sample is collected using a cotton swab that is gently rubbed on the inside of the cheek. Blood samples are also acceptable and are always done by the vendor. NOTE: At-home paternity tests, such as Ancestry.com, 23&Me, etc., are not considered legal evidence of paternity and are not used or accepted as evidence of paternity by DFCS. Family Case Study While a family case study is not as accurate as the traditional father-child DNA testing method, it can still be used to determine paternity with a high degree of accuracy. The more family members that are tested the more accurate the results will be. DNA Collectors Each county is expected to have a minimum of two staff trained as DNA collectors, though counties may have as many DNA collectors as needed. To identify the current DNA Collector, the SSCM may request a current DNA Collector Directory from their Regional Webmaster or the Contract Director. DNA collection is also conducted by a vendor when warranted by case circumstances and coordinated with Regional Webmaster. Regional Webmasters The Regional Webmasters work closely with the Contract Director to coordinate most aspects of DNA collection and testing. They serve as a resource for the DNA Collectors, as well as SSCMs and SSSs. The Regional Webmaster in conjunction with the Contract Director monitors and supervises the DNA collection and testing work of the DNA Collectors. Well-being Paternity Testing SharePoint Site The Contract Director manages a SharePoint site for DNA Collectors and Regional Webmasters to provide a resource for DNA collection and testing, and to be a central data point for use by DNA Collectors and Regional Webmasters to record and monitor all DFCS DNA collection and testing activities.FORMS AND TOOLSN/A",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-19-case-management-section-1923-paternity-testing

In a CPS case, partner with the caregiver to notify law enforcement and the court of the child being located. Submit a new IV-E application in Georgia SHINES if a child returns to foster care from runaway/missing episode. NOTE: New determinations of all eligibility factors, including judicial determinations of contrary to the welfare and reasonable efforts, are required if the child returns to foster care after six months as this is considered a new placement episode for IV-E. Call the NCMEC Hotline Number, 800-THE-LOST (800-843-5678) immediately to notify them that the missing child has been located, if they did not locate the child. In CPS cases, this will be done by the birth parent/legal guardian. Make every effort to place children previously missing from foster care in the same placement they were in prior to becoming missing, when appropriate. Interview the child within 24 hours of the childs return to determine factors that contributed to the child being missing, the childs experiences while absent from care, and to assess whether the child is at risk or is a victim of sex trafficking1 (see Practice Guidance for sample interview questions). If the results of the assessment suggest a child is a victim of sex trafficking: Follow the procedures outlined in the Human Trafficking Case Management Statewide Protocol (see Forms and Tools).  Obtain services specifically to address the issues for the child determined to be at risk or a victim of sex trafficking (see policy 19.17 Case Management: Service Provision).Arrange for or request the parent/caregiver obtain a medical examination with the childs primary physician and/or other appropriate medical professional within 48 hours of the childs return. In CPS cases, the parent must obtain the medical examination. NOTE: The decision to take this action should be based on information revealed during the interview with the child, and/or based on the length of time the child has been missing. Refer the child and family for appropriate services to address identified issues related to the runaway episode or other identified at-risk behaviors (see policy 19.17 Case Management: Service Provision). Develop a written youth runaway prevention plan with the child, their caregivers and others working with the child to address situations that might lead to a recurrence of the runaway behavior (see Practice Guidance: Runaway Prevention Plan). Ensure a copy of the plan is provided to the child and a copy is uploaded to External Documentation in Georgia SHINES. Visit the child more frequently (weekly or more often as needed) to work with the child and caregiver(s) to stabilize their relationship and to address the factors that led to the runaway episode and prevent further disruption. Make efforts to coordinate visits with service providers or CPA/CCI staff, if applicable. Update the case plan when there are newly identified or modified services, treatment and/or needs based on the runaway episode (see policies 8.3 Family Preservation Services: Case Planning and 13.3 Independent Living Program: Written Transitional Living Plan). Document all case management activities and updates in Georgia SHINES within 72 hours of occurrence.The Social Services Supervisor will: Provide oversight of case management activities needed to ensure the safety and wellbeing of children who are at risk of running away, those that are missing and the DFCS staff searching for them. Ensure a runaway plan is developed for children at risk of running away and for those who have returned from runaway episode to prevent the reoccurrence. Explore ongoing efforts to locate the child, discuss case plan progress and provide direction and assistance as needed. Initiate staffings with the County Director or Designee at a minimum of every 90 days (if the child remains on runaway status) to discuss ongoing efforts to locate the child.Regularly review the missing childs case record in Georgia SHINES to ensure all appropriate pages have been updated and all appropriate notifications, search activities, etc. have been documented.Provide timely approval of the Placement page in Georgia SHINES to facilitate the notification to the DFCS Missing Children Team within 24 hours of the child being missing. Maintain regular communication with the SSCM to assess and discuss case activity related to locating the missing child, and ensuring that appropriate assessments and services are provided upon the child being located (see policy 19.6 Case Management: Supervisor Staffing).PRACTICE GUIDANCEMissing Children/Youth The term runaway is used by DFCS to refer to youth (under 18 years of age) whose whereabouts are unknown to their caregiver and there is a reasonable suspicion that the child/youth has absconded from his/her place of residence, and preliminary efforts to locate the child/youth have yielded no results. However, it is important to remember that just because a child is missing does not mean the child ran away. Children may go missing for a number of reasons and it is important to determine why they are missing to improve efforts to locate them and prevent future episodes. There may also be occasions when the whereabouts of a youth 18 years of age and older, who is receiving foster care services, may be unknown. Since such youth are legally adults, they can choose to exit foster care independently without being considered a runaway. Nevertheless, just like young children, youth 18 years of age and older could be missing due to some other reason (e.g. abduction, human trafficking) so it is important to take the appropriate measures to ensure their safety. In all instances, diligent efforts must be made by the caregiver and DFCS to locate missing children/youth. Missing children/youth are at great risk of victimization and exploitation. They usually do not perceive the inherent risks or see themselves as potential victims. Because of the potential dangers to the child, the SSCM is to consider a runaway/missing child episode a major event that requires intensive intervention and safety planning. When children in foster care are missing, DFCS maintains responsibility to conduct a comprehensive search to locate the children and ensure their safety and well-being. Missing children are extremely vulnerable and could be in a dangerous situation. Moreover, the issues that brought the children into care need to be adequately addressed with the parent/caregiver before DFCS intervention is concluded, regardless of the location of the child. DFCS does not seek to be relieved of custody based on the child being missing. In fact, DFCS has formed a Missing Children Team to manage the tracking of missing children in foster care. The DFCS Missing Children Team is comprised of representatives from several sections within the State Office, field operations, and the Georgia Bureau of Investigations. Since the team is notified that a child is missing or located via Georgia SHINES, it is extremely important that the Placement Information Page be completed timely whenever a child is determined to be missing or has returned from being missing. Doing so will ensure accurate accountability for children.Children at Higher Risk for Runaway Behavior Any child can make the decision to run away. Nonetheless, some children seem more inclined to runaway than others. Below are some factors that might indicate that a child is at a higher risk for runaway behavior. Children age 14 years and older; Children with a history or running away; Children who have previously threatened to run away; Children who have experienced multiple placement disruptions; or Children who have been victims of commercial sexual exploitation or human traffickingRunaway Prevention Plan A runaway prevention plan is a method of addressing circumstances and situations that might lead to a runaway episode or a recurrence of runaway behavior. The plan is a written document which helps to promote clarity and accountability. To be more effective, the youth runaway prevention plan should be developed collaboratively with children, their caregivers and others working with the children. After all, if children are not committed to the plan, the plan will not work. The plan needs to be realistic, positive, and based on a childs strengths which will increase the chances of success. Since people and circumstances change, the plan should be updated to ensure it remains applicable to current circumstances. When developing the plan, help children identify their strengths in language easy to understand (e.g. good at being on time, friendly, respectful, athletic, etc.). Ask children what has prevented them from running away in the past (e.g. talking to their case manager, listening to music, talking to a friend, taking a walk, sports, etc.). Try to help children identify triggers, feelings or behaviors that occur when they have thoughts of running away (e.g. feeling overwhelmed, trapped, not knowing what to do, etc.). Ask children how their case manager and caregivers can best support them in remaining in their placement. List any other supports that may be needed (e.g. counseling, mentoring, etc.). Include contact information for DFCS and other significant persons in the youths support network. These will be individuals the youth may contact at any time they find themselves in an unsafe situation or simply wish to return from runaway status. Ask children their caregivers, and all involved parties to sign the plan and give everyone a copy. This makes the plan feel like a real commitment between all the parties involved. Below are some tips for plan development: If a child runs away to see friends, work with caregivers to increase activities the child has with friends. If a child runs away to see biological family, increase family visits (if possible) and make efforts to secure placement with a relative with whom the child is willing to remain. If the agency can limit trauma to the child/young adult and increase connections with supportive people, the child/young adult will be more likely to make progress toward a stable adulthood.  If a child runs away to reunite with parents or caregivers from whom he/she was removed determine if the factors that prevented reunification in the past still relevant. If not follow the Department requirements for pursuing the possibility of reunification. If a child runs away to use drugs, refer the child for a substance abuse assessment and any recommended treatment. If a child runs away because of problems with school, increase educational supports.  If a child runs away because of conflicts with the foster caregivers, work with the child and the caregivers to resolve the conflicts. If it is not possible to resolve the conflicts between the child and caregivers, then seek a more suitable placement for the child.Present Danger Indicators for Runaway Youth These are conditions or behaviors that, in conjunction with the child/youths absence from an environment known to be safe, severely compromise the childs safety. This includes one or more of the following: The child has been or is believed to have been abducted; The child is age 13 or younger; The child has one or more health/mental health conditions that will place the child at serious harm without required treatment; The child is pregnant and/ or parenting, and the infant/child is believed to be with him/her; The child has a physical or developmental disability/delay that impairs the child's ability for self-care; The child has a substance abuse problem; The child was previously the victim of human trafficking or sexual exploitation; The child is in a potentially life-threatening situation; The child is believed to be with persons who could endanger his/her welfare.Law Enforcement Reporting Some law enforcement jurisdictions may not be inclined to accept a missing person report for a specified number of hours or may not timely enter the report into the NCIC database. However, Federal law requires that law enforcement take a report on a missing child and that there be no wait time to take the report. Furthermore, Federal law requires a report of a missing child to be entered within two hours of receipt into the State law enforcement system and the National Crime Information Center computer networks and made available to the Missing Children Information Clearinghouse within the State or other agency designated within the State to receive such reports. Therefore, if told there is a wait time, DFCS staff should reference 34 U.S.C. § 41308 (State requirements for reporting missing children). Seek assistance from the Social Services Supervisor and Special Assistant Attorney General (SAAG) if there is concern that a law enforcement agency is inappropriately handling reports of a missing child. When notifying law enforcement of a missing child, the following information shall be provided: The childs full name, aliases and nicknames, age, date of birth, social security number, and drivers license number (if applicable); A description of the child [i.e., height; weight; hair color; eye color; skin color; braces; clothes worn; book bag; hat; shoes; contact lenses; eyeglasses; dentures; gold or silver teeth; any impairments (physical, hearing, vision, speech); moles; scars; body piercings; or tattoos]; Physical or psychological conditions, developmental delays, or any condition that may affect the ability of the child to respond to environmental dangers; Other factors of endangerment, such as young age, hazardous location, medical needs, disability, etc.; Medications or history of suspected substance abuse; Recent photograph of the child; A copy of the most recent court order granting legal custody of the child and other relevant facts about childs custody status; Type of missing episode (e.g. runaway, family abduction, non-family abduction, etc.); Where, when, and with whom the child was last seen;Possible method of travel (e.g., car, bicycle, public transportation, or on foot);  Names and addresses of foster parents (if applicable), birthparents, relatives, former foster parents (if applicable), and friends; Locations and activities the child is known to frequent; Any suspected destinations; and any prior disappearances and outcomes.National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) The NCMEC is much more than a hotline. It was established in 1984 and is the leading nonprofit organization in the U.S. working with law enforcement, families and the professionals who serve them on issues related to missing and sexually exploited children. When contacted, the NCMEC will send media forms requesting a release of information and a photo of the child. Its Critical and Runaway Unit provides technical assistance to law enforcement and support to those with a claim to custody of children who are missing under critical circumstances or who have run away from their legal guardian. Upon assignment of a case, the case management team makes initial contact with listed parents or guardians and law enforcement to verify circumstances surrounding the childs disappearance. Each team provides the relevant technical assistance and uses the full array of NCMEC resources, including NCMEC missing child posters, requests for analytical reports from NCMECs Case Analysis Division, referrals to NCMECs in-house federal liaisons (including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, United States Marshal Service, United States Postal Inspection Service, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Naval Criminal Investigation Service) and referrals to other NCMEC divisions (Exploited Children Division for possible sexual exploitation, Family Advocacy Division for family support, reunifications and post-recovery support). Once a case is ready, the case management team develops and implements a strategy for poster distribution. Incoming leads are closely monitored and promptly forwarded to law enforcement. The case management teams keep in regular contact with parents or guardians, as well as law enforcement, and continue to assess appropriate resources to help resolve each case.Interview with the Caregiver When a Child is Missing If a child is missing, the SSCM should explore the following issues with the caregiver: Has the child ever run away before, for how long, and where did the child go? Did the child express a desire to run away, go to a specific place, or see a specific person? Did the caregiver observe any cues that the child was planning to run away? Whom is the child permitted to visit? Where (neighborhood, home, school)? Are the parents of the childs friends known by the placement provider? What are the rules of the residence concerning allowable areas for the child to be without first securing caregiver permission? Has the child started any new friendships, or hanging out with new people? Have there been any changes in the childs behavior? What are the changes?Are there issues being experienced by the caregiver that may have contributed to the child running away? Who are the childs friends? Is their contact information known to the caregiver? What steps can be taken to avoid future occurrences of running away?Interview with a Child or Youth Returning from Running Away The interview should be conducted in a manner which demonstrates empathy and concern, while also communicating to the child/youth that their safety is the primary concern. The SSCM shall explore the following:Why did the child run away? (Explore what they expected to accomplish by running away) What led up to the decision to run away? Who was with the child when he/she ran away? Was he/she encouraged to run away? If so, by whom? Where did he/she go?

Whenever possible, children should be placed with relatives as it minimizes trauma for the child, maintains familial and cultural connections, and increases contact with parents and siblings. Additional benefits include decreasing the number of placement disruptions, reducing the amount of time the child spends in foster care and expediting permanency. Information gathering about absent parents, relatives, and the family support network begins during the CPS phase of the case and continues if the child is placed in foster care and continues throughout the life of the case. Timely identification of relatives and fictive kin increases the likelihood of making sound placement decisions. Diligent search efforts should immediately begin when a child enters foster care. It requires pursuing every lead and responding rapidly to every indication of familial interest. Diligent search efforts are not complete when the report is submitted and approved by the Court. When a relative is identified through the diligent search process, it is important to immediately engage him/her to provide timely notification and emphasize the need for him/her to respond timely to DFCS regarding their interest and willingness to provide a permanent home for the child. If the relative does not demonstrate their interest and willingness to provide a permanent home for the child within six months of the Diligent Search Notification, the court has the option to excuse DFCS from considering the relative as placement resource. When this occurs, it is essential that DFCS staff review all applicable court orders to determine whether the court used their discretion to excuse the consideration of a relative. See policy 10.4 Foster Care: Selecting a Placement Resources Practice Guidance: Placement Selection for additional assistance regarding situations in which relatives come forward within the six months time-frame and period for completing an assessment will fall after the child has been placed with a foster parent for 12 months.Who is a Relative of the Child? Relative of the child is a person related to the child by blood, marriage or adoption, including the spouse of any of those persons even if the marriage was terminated by death or dissolution. Relatives include: Maternal and paternal grandparents Great grandparents Uncles and aunts Nieces and nephews Siblings, including siblings that are related through a putative father First cousins and first cousins once-removed (a parents cousin)Who is a Fictive Kin? Fictive kin means a person who is a not related to the child by blood, marriage, or adoption but who prior to his or her placement in foster care is known to the family, has a substantial and positive relationship with the child, and is willing and able to provide a suitable home for the child. There is no comprehensive list of such persons but may include the following. Godparents Neighbors Close family friends Spiritual advisors or congregation members Person defined as a relative of a refugee childDomestic partner or former domestic partner of the childs parent if the child had a relationship with the former domestic partner prior to coming into care Adoptive parent of a childs sibling Legal or biological parent of a childs half sibling Person defined as a relative by the childs tribe if the child is an American Indian/ Alaska Native child under the ICWA or is in the legal custody of the tribe  Others identified by the child or familyWho are Other Persons? Other persons are individuals identified by the child or the family that have an emotional significant relationship with the child includes but are not limited to: Previous neighbors Teachers Scoutmasters Previous foster parents Parents of friends of the child, with whom such child has resided or had significant contactWho is a Sibling of a Child? A child's sibling is an individual with whom a child shares one or both parents in common by blood, adoption or marriage, even if the marriage was terminated by death or dissolution. Such an individual shall still be considered a sibling of the child following termination of parental rights (TPR) up until a finalized adoption occurs. Such an individual shall also still be considered a sibling of the child following the death of their common parent(s). Initiating a Diligent Search The SSCM assigned to the childs foster care case has the primary responsibility for conducting the diligent search. Once the child is removed, the search intensifies. The CPS and Permanency SSCMs share in the responsibility of obtaining relevant information and documenting the search efforts in Georgia SHINES. Interviewing the parent and the child are key activities to beginning a diligent search. Diligent search is also required for a child who enters foster care as a result of Voluntary Placement Agreement (VPA).Diligent Search and Significant Safety Issues Contact is not required with any absent parent, relative, fictive kin and other committed individuals when it may cause a significant safety issue for the child or parents. Each situation must be assessed with the SSS to determine if contact is required. The decision will be staffed with the SSAG and clearly documented in Georgia SHINES. When assessing whether an absent parent should be contacted, the SSA must be included. Some instances in which safety may be of a concern are: Domestic violence/Intimate partner violence Protective orders Criminal history related to abuse of a childParents/Legal Custodian Engagement A child entering foster care is a traumatic event which impacts the lives of all involved. There may be times when the SSCM will need to engage the parent/legal custodian about diligent search during their first encounter. The parent/legal custodian may be emotionally overwhelmed and may not trust DFCS and is defensive in his/her response to DFCS urgency in obtaining relative information. The parent/legal custodian may prefer not to involve their family for fear that relatives may not approve of their circumstances. This is an opportunity for the SSCM to build rapport by having an honest conversation with the parent/legal custodian explaining diligent search, the purpose of a diligent search, and the urgency is of conducting it timely. Also, explain that specific information about the circumstances that precipitated the child entering care cannot be disclosed to family and other individuals, however, family can be informed that the child is in foster care. Terms should be explained in a manner that the parent/legal custodian can understand and answer any questions he/she may have. Ask the parent/ legal custodian his/her placement preferences, if reunification is no longer an option. The SSCM should be empathetic and nonjudgmental about the parents/legal custodians feelings. Inform the parent/legal custodian they will be asked to testify under oath about absent parent(s), relatives, fictive kin and other committed individuals. Re-engage the parent(s)/legal custodian at each contact for additional information about relatives, friends, fictive kin and other committed individuals that could support the child and family while their child is in foster care. Ongoing communication with the parent/legal custodian regarding who was located and contacted and the next steps is also necessary to build a partnership and overcome any barriers.Child Engagement Children want their voices to be heard and input in the changes occurring around them. A child should be involved in the diligent search process and the decision-making when age and developmentally appropriate. The diligent search process should be explained to the child in a manner that he/she can understand and answer any of his/her questions. Engage the child in identifying relatives and other important people in his/her life and provide the benefits of finding family to support the child while in foster care. Keep the child informed on who was located and contacted and the next steps. Contacting Identified Persons All identified persons should be contacted whether in the state of Georgia or out of the state. When contacting identified persons, it is important to provide the reason for the communication. Take into consideration the person maybe be unaware of the familys child welfare involvement or the child is out of the home and may become emotional. The SSCM should discuss the different options that the person can play in the childs life while in foster care to demonstrate his/her interest and willingness to provide a permanent home if reunification is not possible, for example: Providing care for the child while in foster by becoming a kinship caregiver or foster parent; Visiting with the child (i.e. summer vacation, weekends, holidays); and Providing additional support (i.e. transportation, maintaining regular contact with the child, participating in case planning activities).Communication is important in managing expectations about the potential outcomes. The SSCM should be clear about his/her intentions, the six-month timeframe of being considered a permanent resource for the child, and not make promises he/she cannot keep. Always ask about additional relatives, friends, fictive kin, or other supportive persons in the parent or child lives. Be sure to provide the SSCMs contact information if he/she has additional questions or information. Following the initial contact, provide the Diligent Search Notification form to relatives or parents of a sibling of the child where the parent has legal custody of the sibling outlining the services available to the individual if he/she decides to become a resource. The SSCM should encourage the persons timely response. The SSCM should follow up on every potential lead and document the results. When individuals have been identified as a possible resource for the child or the family, it is important to maintain contact to provide updates even if there is no progress to report. A person may be ruled out due to CPS history or criminal history, he/she should be promptly notified of the determination and informed of any role he/she can play in the childs life while in foster care. Some persons may not be emotionally ready to become involved in the case and may need some additional time to consider his/her options. It is important to periodically revisit persons who at one point may have declined as feelings change over time.Absent Parents Parents help children understand who they are, their family, culture and heritage. When a parent is absent or missing from a childs life, the child is in essence missing a piece of him/her self. It is important for a child to maintain contact with both parents. When a child is removed from the custody of either one parent or a legal custodian, diligent search efforts must include a search for the absent parent(s). This includes inquiring about the absent parent(s) with the parent/legal custodian from whom the child was removed, the child, relatives, and other persons contacted while conducting a diligent search. Sometimes a parent/legal custodian will not reveal the identity of the absent parent(s) or only identify the absent parent by first name or proclaim no knowledge about the absent parents location. The parent/guardian may have a number of reasons he/she will not provide this information which may include fear that absent parent(s) may seek or be granted legal custody, they had a problematic relationship that he/she wishes to leave in the past, or the absent parent has not played a role in the childs life. The SSCM should acknowledge and normalize the parents/legal custodians feelings about the situation. However, it should not impact DFCS due diligence to locate an absent parent, unless there is family violence and it imposes a significant safety issue for the child or parent. Keep in mind an absent parent may not be aware of DFCS involvement or the circumstances that precipitated the involvement. Also, an absent parent may not be aware that he/she even has a child. Even vague information that you receive may help you locate the absent parent. Other sources of information used to identify and locate absent parents are the following: Childs birth certificate can provide the following: Mothers maiden name Mothers marital status at the time of birth  The identity of the father. Putative Father Registry is a list of names of men who have acknowledged paternity of a child by completing the Paternity Acknowledgement form or have indicated the possibility of paternity without acknowledging paternity of the child (see policy 11.2 Adoptions: Putative Father Registry & Birth Certificates). Military branches of services can be contacted if the individual is believed to be in the military or recently discharged from the military. Federal Parent Locator service documents new hire information and can locate persons in the county where they are presently working. http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cse/newhire Federal Bureau of Prisons Inmate Locator website can be used if information indicates that an absent parent is currently incarcerated in a federal ",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-19-case-management-section-1920-diligent-search

The genogram is a visual representation of a childs current and extended family which is a useful tool that can support child welfare practice in various ways including: Family engagement Clarifying family relationships Identifying household composition safety and family functioning assessments as well as case planning Determining the family stage Facilitating diligent search efforts  Identifying a potential voluntary kinship caregiver, placement resource, permanency resource, visiting resource, and/or support network Providing critical information regarding a childs life historyConstruction of the genogram should begin early in the life of the case as it is invaluable in clarifying and documenting family relationships. Completing the genogram with the family is an effective strategy for engaging the family as it encourages a more inclusiveness and provides an opportunity to demonstrate the SSCMs interest in the family. Embrace cultural differences when considering who is family. Kinship relationships should be respected based on the family's cultural values and emotional ties. The genogram may also be used as a conversation-starter to explore additional information about culture, religion, ethnicity, behavioral and emotional relationship patterns, strengths, supports and everyday tasks that present challenges for individuals within the family. As more information emerges so does the relationship context. The construction of the genogram should make sense to the family, or it can appear intrusive. Therefore, the SSCM should provide a clear explanation of the purpose, process, and symbols to the family. The diagram should be hand-drawn during face-to-face contact to promote family engagement. The genogram construction should always clearly reflect the name, age, gender, and relationship of family members over three generations; and must identify family members who comprise the household; and non-relatives and fictive kin identified as family. During construction, inquire about other family members that may provide additional information to include in the genogram. A review of the hand-drawn genogram with the family is required for completion and accuracy.If the hand-drawn genogram is converted into a computer-generated version, it should be clearly explained to the family it was created from the hand-drawn version developed with the family. Updates or amendments to the genogram (hand-drawn or computer-generated) must be made in partnership with the family. A review of the updated or amended genogram with the family is required for completion and accuracy. It should also be clearly documented that the genogram was reviewed with the family.FORMS AND TOOLSGenogram Symbol Sheet",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-19-case-management-section-1919-genogram

 Meet with the family and service provider to address and resolve any service barriers.Develop a consensus with the family and service provider on case outcomes and the path to address the familys needs. Explore the possibility of court involvement if unable to engage the family to overcome the barriers to service provision. Participate in a supervisory staffing for feedback and case direction.The SSS will: When a barrier to service provision has been identified, prior to making a decision, ensure information is gathered and assessed to determine the nature of the problem. During supervisor staffing, in conjunction with the SSCM, using information gathered identify if the barrier is a resource or implementation issue and provide guidance to overcome the barriers.Staff Changes During Service Provision The receiving SSCM will: Prior to DFCS staff changes, review service notes to evaluate services and progress towards case plan outcomes with the current assigned SSCM and initiate a staffing to discuss case progress, barriers, etc.  Conduct a joint visit with the family, current SCCM if available and service provider to discuss:  Current services being provided to the family and any barriers. Expected outcome and timeline of service completion. Timeline for staff change to occur. Current contact information for the family and newly assigned SCCMPrior to any changes in providers (formal/informal), the SSCM will: Discuss changes with the provider and any impact on service provision. Implement services using guidelines above. Ensure that all service notes/reports have been received, reviewed and uploaded into Georgia SHINES External Documentation from the outgoing provider. Schedule a meeting with the family, current provider and newly assigned provider, when possible to facilitate a smooth transition for the family. NOTE: Conducting meetings with informal providers when there is a staff change may be challenging but should be completed when possible. Assist the family in processing any feelings they may have around changing providers and building rapport with the new provider by: Listening to the familys concerns. Explaining the need for the change in service providers (i.e. promotions, resignations, expertise). Reassuring the family of DFCS role in ensuring the change does not negatively impact service provision and case outcome.PRACTICE GUIDANCEServices are family-centered, community-based, and culturally competent activities that help achieve case plan outcomes and should be built around the specific developmental tasks that a family is having difficulty managing. The goal of services is to maintain children safely in their homes, ensure timely reunification when children must be removed from their families, and prevent the need for future child welfare involvement by fostering sustained behavioral changes. Services should be tailored to the individual and/or family and should always be focused on the attainment of outcomes.Case Manager Role in Service Provision Service provision begins with preparing the family to manage the difficult situations they are facing in their lives by engaging the family in a discussion of available service options that include, possible providers, community resources the family would like to utilize, formal providers contracted with DFCS, and in-home or out-of-home providers. It is necessary to engage the service provider to ensure that services identified in the case plan are provided to assist the family in meeting case plan outcomes. Every effort should be made to transition the family into services as smoothly as possible. Best practice is to complete an initial visit with the provider and family to establish the partnership between the two and discuss outcomes and expectations for service completion. Once services have begun, periodic discussion with the family and the service providers regarding the effectiveness of provided services toward outcome achievement, should occur.Warm Hand-off A warm handoff is a handoff that is conducted in person, between DFCS staff and the provider, with the family present. Warm handoffs can help to minimize communication breakdowns which can interfere with the timely and appropriate provision of services. It can also help to engage families and encourage them to ask questions, allow them to clarify or correct the information exchanged, and ultimately build relationships through transparent partnership.Formal and Informal Services Formal services are those provided by professional or trained employees or contractors and may be paid or unpaid. Informal services are services and supports provided by individuals/entities, such as extended family, friends, church or other organizations, etc. Trauma Informed Services Trauma may adversely impact child development and should be effectively minimized in a manner that does not cause additional trauma. To recover from trauma, children and families often require treatment delivered by skilled professionals. Trauma informed services are services that understand, recognize and respond to the effects of all types of trauma. Trauma informed services incorporate knowledge about trauma prevalence, impact, and recovery, in all aspects of service delivery, minimize re-victimization, and facilitate recovery and empowerment. Traumatic stress impacts children and families, many behaviors and responses that may seem ineffective and unhealthy in the present, represent adaptive responses to past traumatic experiences. Every child that enters foster care receives a trauma assessment that helps to identify traumatic experiences in their lives that may impact their physical and emotional wellbeing. SSCMs should inquire about whether services being sought from providers are trauma informed and make every effort to secure such services for children and families served.Cultural Competence in Service Provision Cultural competence refers to the process by which individuals and systems respond respectfully and sensitive to people of all cultures, languages, classes, race, ethnic backgrounds, religions, spiritual traditions, immigration status and other diversity factors (gender, sexual orientation, disability, profession) in a matter that recognizes, affirms and values the worth of individuals and families and protects and preserves the dignity of each. To provide culturally competent services one must identify and understand a familys culture. A persons culture is a combination of the attitudes and practices that ultimately shape the behaviors of individuals and groups of people. When culture is considered in service provision, the SSCM is knowledgeable about and skillful in the use of services, resources, and institutions available to serve multi-cultural individuals and make cultural appropriate referrals within both formal and informal networks.Barriers to Service Provision When the provision of services hit a roadblock in implementation, participation and completion we commonly refer to it as a barrier to service provision. It is important to assess barriers in each individual circumstance as there could be varying reasons. Overcoming barriers requires the commitment of the case manager as well as the involvement of service providers and families. Included below is a list of common barriers and possible solutions: Lack of consensus: building a consensus with the family around services at the beginning of the case, including have a discussion around service options. Relation issues: meet with the family and service provider to resolve conflict and redirect the focus to case plan outcome achievement. Scheduling issues: prior to selecting a provider verify the familys and the providers schedules are not in conflict.  Lack of local providers: research service providers outside of the familys community that may be able meet the identified need.Services to Address Family Needs Can include, but are not limited to: Children 1st and Babies Cant Wait to assess and meet the developmental delays, physical disability, physical impairment or diagnosed disability of children under age three. Educational Programming Assessment & Consultation (EPAC) to address the educational needs/stability of Unaccompanied Homeless Youth and children in foster care. Individual counseling or psychotherapy can help with: Unresolved individual issues that are incapacitating; Poorly developed interpersonal relationships; Mental health disorders; and  Children who have been identified as victims (or suspected victims) of sex trafficking also known as the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children (CSEC) Marital and family counseling can help with: Families with destructive relationships; Generational conflict; Blended families; Child development; and Role conflicts, boundary issues, or scapegoating. Substance use assessment and treatment to address: Recovery;Relapse prevention; Child dependency issues related to parent/guardian/legal custodian substance and/or alcohol use.

Characteristics and behaviors that demonstrate mutual caring, feeling secure, a sense of belonging, open communication, and making each person in the family feel valued are desired. Some questions to consider when determining whether a family is functioning well include: Does the family have fun together despite their daily demands: What activities do they do together; What were they doing the last time they laughed together as a family; or  Does the family sit down to meals together. Are there clear family rules that apply equally to all members: Are family members expectations of each other realistic, mutually agreed upon, and usually met; or Are these rules flexible enough to adapt to a change in the family dynamics/situation How does each caregiver spend individual time with the child(ren): Do family members achieve their goals, and are their needs being met; Do all the children in the home have the same opportunities to participate in extracurricular activities. Is there genuine respect between the caregiver and children:How do they demonstrate love, trust, and concern for one another; Are love, trust, and concern shown the same way when disagreements occur; or How does the family adapt to change (upset, unhappy, unphased).FORMS AND TOOLSFamily Functioning Assessment Tool",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-19-case-management-section-1913-family-functioning

When Safety Plan protection strategies have been integrated into the case/family plan, it is not required to maintain a separate Safety Plan.  Ensure the Safety Plan is ended when the safety assessment determined the child is safe and confirm the family is aware they are no longer responsible for adhering to the Safety Plan.PRACTICE GUIDANCEA Safety Plan is a written arrangement between a parent(s)/legal guardian(s) and DFCS that establishes protection strategies or actions required to stop or prevent harm to the child. The Safety Plan is implemented and active as long as the child is determined to be unsafe. The Safety Plan specifies the safety threat, how the safety threat will be controlled using what actions, tasks, or services; who will participate in the actions, tasks, or services; and specification of time requirements.Evaluate with the parent/legal guardian what option is best for the family, and what controls will be effective. Reaching a consensus with the parent/legal guardian around the protection strategies is an integral part of evaluating Safety Plan sufficiency since each family and each situation are different. What worked for one family may not work for another family with a similar situation. The alleged maltreater cannot serve as the one expected to provide the protection or relied on to follow through with the directives (i.e., Ms. Jones will not use physical discipline). The parent(s)/legal guardianship(s) role in the Safety Plan is limited to their assessed diminished capacity. A Safety Plan must: Manage or control the safety threat(s) identified during the safety assessment using the actions and services described within the Safety Plan.  Have an immediate effect. Include persons involved in the Safety Plan who are immediately accessible and available.Safety Plans and Present Danger A safety plan developed to address present danger is usually based on limited information and established during a period in which there is an active family crisis. The protection strategies must be immediate, short-term (until assessment is completed), and control the present danger identified. Safety Plans and Impending DangerThe safety plan developed to address impending danger is usually based on a fuller understanding of family functioning. The protection strategies must be sufficient to control the impending danger identified.Safety Plan Options In-home Safety Plan: where the child remains in their home with protection strategies to assure a child safety. The maltreating caregiver leaves the home; A support person temporarily moves into the home; A support person assumes partial or full-time child supervision (e.g., daycare, weekends); A non-custodial parent (putative, legal, biological) assumes care of the child in their home; or Services placed in the home or outside of the home but contribute to the child remaining in the home.In-home Safety Plan criteria: The parent(s)/legal guardian(s) are residing in the home which is an established residence.The home environment is calm and consistent enough for protection strategies to have the necessary effect; and service providers and the safety support person(s) can be safe in the home.  The parent(s)/legal guardian(s) are: Willing to participate in carrying out the Safety Plan within the home; Accepting and recognize the need for the Safety Plan; and Capable/possess the ability to implement the Safety Plan. The availability of informal (family network) and formal (community/services) resources to assure child safety in the home.If the circumstances do not meet the criteria for an in-home safety plan, an out of-home safety plan is required. Out-of-home Safety Plan: An out-of-home Safety Plan is where the child is separated from the home and the safety threats. The child(ren) is cared for outside of the home by a voluntary kinship caregiver; or The child(ren) is placed in foster care.Out-of-home Safety Plan criteria Safety threats are so extreme or occurring within the family in such a way to prevent in home child safety management.  A child is so provocative or out of control. The nature of the home environment is so chaotic, unpredictable, or dangerous. The parent(s)/legal guardian(s) are unwilling to accept an in-home Safety Plan option; are unwilling to accept people, resources or services that are available for a Safety Plan. The parent(s)/legal guardian(s) willingness to accept an in-home Safety Plan option cannot be confirmed or relied upon.Identifying and Assessing Informal and Formal Resources When developing a Safety Plan, assist the family with identifying informal (family) and formal (community) resources that can support the Safety Plan: Inquire about the family network: Is there any resource (family, neighbors, and individuals in the community) within your family network that can help control the safety threat? How do you know if they are willing/able? What is known about these resources? How can we find out? Partner with the family to locate community service providers (see policy 19.17 Case Management: Service Provision) Assess whether the resources are sufficient and available to control the safety threats, and meet the following criteria: Be a responsible, physically, and cognitively adequate adult who must understand the dangers and accept that the dangers exist. Be fully aware, committed, and capable of carrying out assigned task(s).  Be available, which means that he/she can begin providing the safety support the same day the Safety Plan is enacted. Be accessible, which means near transportation and easily and immediately reachable.Be trustworthy, willing to work with DFCS in a cooperative/collaborative relationship and willing to communicate regularly. Understand the schedule, activities, and expectations that are established to ensure child safety.  In addition, support persons must have: A viewpoint towards the child that is appropriate and realistic.An attitude about the child and family that is consistent with the facts. An attitude toward the caregivers that is appropriate and realistic. An availability to enter the home and to provide sufficient support to the family. A safe and stable home.A history of being protective and providing acceptable care to children. No active CPS case or a history that would exclude them from providing support.Monitoring the Safety PlanSafety Plans require uninterrupted oversight or monitoring to assure protection strategies to stop or prevent harm to the child are effective. Monitoring the Safety Plan requires a thorough knowledge of a family and the identified safety threats. Information obtained through purposeful contacts with the parent(s)/legal guardian(s), child, collaterals etc.; conducting safety assessments; and monitoring service provision is used to monitor the Safety Plan. Monitoring a Safety Plan includes: Confirming all parties involved are adhering to the Safety Plan; Evaluating if the Safety Plan is sufficient to control the threats to child safety; and Assessing if the least restrictive Safety Plan option is being utilized to control safety threats.Modifying the Safety Plan Safety Plan modification is required when the safety assessment determines that the child continues to be unsafe despite the current Safety Plan. This means the current Safety Plan is not sufficient to control the threats to child safety and must be immediately modified to assure the safety of the child. The Safety Plan is also required to be modified if a less restrictive Safety Plan option can be used to manage the threats to child safety. A range of Safety Plan options exists, and the Safety Plan can be adjusted along that continuum based on the safety assessment. Modifying the Safety Plan from an out-of-home to an in-home option should be considered to accelerate a childs return home when child safety can be maintained. For example: A transition from a voluntary kinship arrangement to the voluntary kinship caregiver residing in the childs home providing the safety supports. Additional information on the parent/legal guardian is pending (medical or psychological evaluation), but the support person can provide the level of supervision required in the childs home until results are received. The child is vulnerable due to a physical disability that requires constant medical care outside the home due to lack of access to medical supports. Medical supports subsequently become available for in home care and support for the child.Safety Plan Confidentiality The Safety Plan and information included in the Safety Plan is confidential and can only be shared with the parent(s)/legal guardian(s). Engaging with support persons who can assist with the Safety Plan is necessary to provide protection for a child but may also create a situation where confidential information can be unlawfully disclosed. Any information shared outside of the parent/legal guardian including with the school, support person, etc. is an unlawful disclosure. When the disclosure of confidential information is necessary to implement the Safety Plan, the SSCM will reach a consensus with the SSS that the disclosure of such information is necessary and the specific information the parent/legal guardian will be requested to disclose to the support person to help assure child safety. Engage the parent/legal guardian and explain since they are willing to enter into a Safety Plan SSCM recognizes they would like to keep their child safe, but in order for the support person to be successful in fulfilling their role, confidential information would need to be shared. Explain to the parent/legal guardian:DFCS responsibility in maintaining confidentiality and safeguarding information, including DFCS cannot share their information without their written consent. The specific information DFCS is requesting to disclose to the support person(s). He/she has the right to choose what information, if any, can be discussed and with whom the information can be discussed. Supports persons sign a confidentiality agreement, however, they are not legally required to maintain confidentiality of your information. The authorization is restricted to sharing information with the support person regarding the Safety Plan He/she has the right to decline the request to share confidential information. Declining to authorize disclosure, will not negatively impact his/her DFCS case. He/she retains the right to withdraw the authorization at any time. A new Safety Plan will be necessary if he/she does not consent to disclosure of the information.When the parent/legal guardian agrees to the release of their confidential information to the support person, request the parent/legal guardian personally share the information with the support person. Inform that self-disclosure allows them to take control of the situation and is more likely to result in family buy-in. Describe the assistance the SSCM can provide the parent/legal guardian with the disclosure such as role playing, help framing the discussion, and/or being present at the time of disclosure. When the parent/legal guardian agrees to the release of their confidential information to the support person but does not wish to personally share the information with the support, request the parent/legal guardian, complete an Authorization for Release of Information in accordance with policy 2.6 Information Management: Confidentiality/Safeguarding Information. When the parent/legal guardian does not agree to the disclosure of their confidential information, sharing information with the support person is not permitted. When this occurs, the SSCM should consult with the SSS and re-engage the family to develop a new Safety Plan to ensure child safety.Ending a Safety Plan Ending the Safety Plan terminates the agreement between the family and DFCS that established the protection strategies to stop or prevent harm to the child. A Safety Plan should be ended following the completion a safety assessment that determined a child to be safe (see policy 19.11 Case Management: Safety Assessment). Ending the Safety Plan is the process of communicating to the parent/legal guardian and support persons that they are no longer responsible for implementing the protection strategies outlined in the Safety Plan or Safety Plan Support Person Agreement. Ending a Safety Plan is critical as it can provide a family a sense of accomplishment and alleviate them of implementing protection strategies that can often be burdensome. While, Safety Plans are not valid beyond case closure, closing a case is not the equivalent of ending a Safety Plan and neither does it eliminate the need to end the Safety Plan.Difference Between a Safety Plan and Case Plan Safety Plans During Special Investigations During a special investigation Safety Plans are limited to addressing safety threats related to a child in the legal custody of a: DFCS foster or adoptive parent  Child placing agency (CPA) foster or adoptive parent Kinship caregiver Parent/legal guardian during a child death, near fatality, or serious injury (CD/NF/SI) To address safety threats to a child in DFCS custody during a special investigation see Chapter 6: Special Investigations.FORMS AND TOOLSSafety Plan (e-version)Safety Plan (e-version)  SpanishSafety Plan (example)Safety Plan Support Person Agreement (e-version)Safety Plan Support Person Agreement (e-version)  Spanish",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-19-case-management-section-1912-safety-plan

A safety assessment does not only focus on proving or disproving the events and occurrences (incidents) associated with the maltreatment. Through the collection and analysis of information a picture of the family and caregiver functioning is formed. The safety assessment process will: Gather quality and sufficient safety related information about family conditions (family functioning). Identify the presence of conditions or actions within the childs current living situation that represent the likelihood of imminent serious harm to the child (present or impending danger). Determine if the child is vulnerable to safety threats. Evaluate caregiver protective capacities to determine if a caregiver can and will protect a child from safety threats.  Examine how the identified safety threats are occurring within the family in order to determine what is required to effectively control them, if applicable.Make a safety decision (safe and unsafe).Gathering Safety Related Information A safety assessment is totally dependent upon the quality and sufficiency of safety-related information known about the family. Four methods for gathering foundational information during a safety assessment are: Analyzing DFCS history and evaluating the impact on the current circumstances. Interviewing children, parents (custodial/non-custodial), caregivers, and current household members. Observations of interactions between caregivers, children, and other household members and the physical conditions of the home environment. Engaging collateral contacts (teachers, other professionals, family members, law enforcement, etc.) and obtaining relevant information (medical records, police reports, photographs, school records, etc.).Conditions or Actions That Represent the Likelihood of Imminent Serious Harm to the Child Present Danger  Present danger is an immediate, significant, and clearly observable family condition, child condition, individual behavior or action, or family circumstance which is in the process of occurring and which obviously endangers or threatens to endanger a child and requires immediate action to protect. Immediate means that the danger in the family is happening right before your eyes. You are in the midst of that which endangers or threatens to endanger the child. The dangerous family condition, child condition, individual behavior or acts, or family circumstances are active and operating. What might result from the danger for a child could be happening or occur at any moment.Significant qualifies the family condition, child condition, individual behavior or acts, or family circumstances as exaggerated, out of control, and extreme. The danger is recognizable because what is happening is onerous, vivid, impressive, and notable. What you encounter or what is happening exists as the dominant matter that must be addressed immediately. Present danger is clearly observable because what is happening or in the process of happening is totally transparent. You see and experience it in obvious ways. There is no guesswork. Here is a rule of thumb concerned with identifying present danger. If you have to interpret what is going on to be present danger¦ then it is likely not present danger. Usually when present danger exists because of extreme family conditions, a childs condition, individual behavior or acts, or family circumstances you will know even without conducting interviews. Of course, when Present Danger does exist, conducting interviews should proceed in accordance with good practice.When judging present danger, there are a number of other concerns that you should consider. Understand that these additional areas of consideration do not represent present danger but help to qualify present danger situations: Child is 0 - 6 Years Old: In all safety assessments, the age of the child is relevant. The ability to self-protect is fundamental when assessing child vulnerability. Young children are emphasized here because of the higher vulnerability factor and propensity to suffer from danger. Children under six years of age and socially isolated (not in school or day care etc.) who are injured must be assessed to be in present danger. History of Reports: Within the context of judging present danger, a history of CPS reports on the family is important to consider. To judge present danger, it can be helpful to consider the number of reports, reports that indicate progressively more serious concerns related to family functioning, reports of the same nature as the current area of concern, and so forth.The Family Situation Will/May Change Quickly: You may have information that describes a current circumstance occurring with the family which reveals exactly what is going on that could be considered as present danger. Because this situation could change rapidly, the opportunity to gather important information may be lost. In this sense, this influence does not necessarily constitute a present danger situation; however, it is pertinent in judging how intervention will proceed.Services Inaccessible or Unavailable: This is a family circumstance which, in and of itself, is not a present danger situation. The issues could become a present danger situation when considered in relation to other negative family conditions, which demand access to services. For instance, if a service is unavailable or inaccessible for a child who has a life-threatening condition that requires medical intervention, a present danger circumstance may be applicable. Accessible to a Threatening Person: This is another issue that must be considered in concert with other family conditions. It refers to a situation such as a single caregiver who is responsible for primary care of their child; however, the child may also be required to spend a significant amount of time with a secondary caregiver who isolates the child, exhibits threatening behavior toward the child or the primary caregiver, etc. This circumstance can be used to consider current accessibility as well as anticipated accessibility in the near future to the caregiver who is threatening to the child, such as when a child goes home from school or on weekends. Family Isolated: This situation does not qualify as present danger just because a family may be isolated from others. Present danger must be considered along with what is actually occurring within the family in conjunction with geographic and social isolation.Impending Danger refers to a child who is in a continuous state of danger due to a parent/caregivers behavior, attitude, motives, emotions and/or situations posing a specific threat of severe harm to a child. These threats are negative family conditions that are out of control in the presence of a vulnerable child, and therefore likely to have severe effects on a child at any time in the near future. These threats are specific, observable and can be clearly understood and described in the assessment content. Impending danger safety threats have four distinct features: Refers to threats to a childs safety that exist and are insidious but are not immediate, obvious, or active at the onset of DFCS intervention. Refers to threats that eventually are identified and understood upon more fully evaluating and understanding individual and family conditions and functioning.  Refers to threats that reasonably will result in severe harm if safety intervention does not occur and is not sustained. Family situations and behaviors must meet safety threshold criteria to qualify as impending danger safety threats.The five criteria used to justify impending danger are: Observable refers to family behaviors, conditions or situations representing a danger to a child that are specific, definite, real, can be seen and understood, and are subject to being reported and justified. The criterion observable does not include suspicion, intuitive feelings, difficulties in worker-family interaction, lack of cooperation, or difficulties in obtaining information. Vulnerable Child refers to a child who is dependent on others for protection and is exposed to circumstances that he/she is powerless to manage. The child is susceptible, accessible, and available to a threatening person in authority over them. Vulnerability is judged according to age, physical and emotional development, ability to communicate needs, mobility, size and dependence, and susceptibility. This definition also includes all young children from 0-6 years and older children who, for whatever reason, are not able to protect themselves or seek help or protection from others. Out of Control refers to family behavior, conditions or situations that are unrestrained, resulting in an unpredictable and possibly chaotic family environment that is not subject to the influence, manipulation, or within the familys control. Such out-of-control family conditions pose a danger and cannot be managed by anyone or anything internal to the family system. Imminent refers to the belief that dangerous family behaviors, conditions, or situations will remain active, or become active, within the next several days or weeks. This is consistent with a degree of certainty or inevitability that danger and severe harm are possible, even likely outcomes, without intervention. Severity refers to the effects of maltreatment that have already occurred and/or the potential for harsh effects based on the vulnerability of a child and the family, coupled with a behavior, condition or situation that is out of control. As far as danger is concerned, the safety threshold is consistent with severe harm. Severe harm includes such effects as serious physical injury, disability, terror and extreme fear, impairment, and death. The safety threshold is in line with family conditions that reasonably could result in harsh and unacceptable pain and suffering for a vulnerable child.Impending Danger and the Danger Threshold Criteria The danger threshold criteria must be applied when considering and identifying any of the impending danger safety threats. In other words, the specific justification for identifying any of the impending danger safety threats is based on a specific description of how negative family conditions meet the danger threshold criteria. Risk to Safety Continuum: The safety threshold is the point at which a negative family condition (difficult family situation) goes beyond being concerning (risk) and becomes dangerous to a childs safety. Difficult family situations or negative family conditions that rise to the level of the safety threshold and become impending danger safety threats are, in essence, negative circumstances and/or caregiver behaviors, emotions, etc. that negatively impact caregiver performance at a heightened degree and occur at a greater level of intensity. Impending Danger is where risk crosses the safety threshold.Child VulnerabilityChild vulnerability refers to a childs capacity for self-protection. Safety is only an issue when there is a vulnerable child in the family; if the child is not vulnerable to the identified threats, the child is safe. The following factors should be used to help judge child vulnerability: Age Children from birth to six years old are always vulnerable. Physical Disability Regardless of age, children who are physically handicapped and therefore unable to remove themselves from danger are vulnerable. Mental Disability Regardless of age, children who are cognitively limited are vulnerable because of a number of possible limitations: recognizing danger, knowing who can be trusted, meeting their basic needs, and seeking protection.  Provocative A childs emotional, mental health and behavioral problems can be such that they irritate and provoke others to act out toward them or to totally avoid them.  PowerlessRegardless of age, intellect and physical capacity, children who are highly dependent and susceptible to others are vulnerable. These children are typically so influenced by emotional and psychological attachment that they are subject to the whims of those who have power over them. Powerlessness could also be observed in vulnerable children who are exposed to threatening circumstances that they are unable to manage. Defenseless Regardless of age, a child who is unable to defend him/herself against aggression is vulnerable. This can include children who are oblivious to danger. Children who are frail or lack mobility are defenseless and therefore more vulnerable. Non-Assertive Regardless of age, children who are so passive or withdrawn and are not able to communicate their basic needs are vulnerable. A child who cannot or will not seek help and protection from others is vulnerable. Illness Regardless of age, some children have continuing or acute medical problems and needs that make them vulnerable.  Invisible A child who is not noticed and observed should be considered vulnerable regardless of age.Child Vulnerability Summary Child vulnerability is the first conclusion one makes when completing a safety assessment.  A judgment about child vulnerability is based on the capacity for self-protection. Self-protection refers to being able to demonstrate behavior that: Results in defending oneself against threats of safety; and Results in successfully meeting ones own basic (safety) needs. Child vulnerability is not a matter of degree. Children are vulnerable to threats of safety, or they are not. Older children may also have characteristics that make them vulnerable to safety threats.  As a safety assessment concern, a childs vulnerability helps inform us about what must be done to manage threats and assure protection.Caregiver Capacity Caregiver Protective Capacities are personal and caregiving behavioral, cognitive, and emotional characteristics that can be specifically and directly associated with being protective of ones young. Protective capacities are personal qualities or characteristics that contribute to vigilant child protection and can be described as follows: The characteristic prepares the person to be protective. The characteristic enables or empowers the person to be protective. The characteristic is necessary or fundamental to being protective.The characteristic must exist prior to being protective. The characteristic can be related to acting or being able to act on behalf of a child.How Safety Threats Are Occurring with a Family How safety threats are occurring within a family is evaluated to determine the need and kind of safety planning (i.e., in-home safety plan, out-of-home safety plan, or a combination of both) required to effectively control and manage threats to child safety. How safety threats are occurring within a family can be understood by breaking down the conditions associated with the safety threat and how the parts reveal the way the safety factor is manifested within the family during everyday life. There are six analytical questions that help break the safety threat down.How long have conditions in the family posed a threat to safety? How frequent or often does the family condition pose a threat to safety? How predictable is the family condition or the safety factor? Are there occasions when either is more likely to be an active influence? Are there specific times during the day, evening, night, etc. that might require special attention due to the way in which the family condition or the safety factor is occurring? Do individual or family conditions or safety threats prevent a caregiver from adequately functioning in primary roles (i.e., individual life management and parenting)? What is associated with, occurs at the same time, or influences the family condition or the safety factor?Safety Decision (Safe or Unsafe) The decision about whether a child is safe or unsafe is based on the evaluation of the family. The conclusion about safety is based on safety-related information, the identification of safety threats and an evaluation of the capacity of caregivers to protect. Safety informs and guides all decisions made throughout the life of the case, including removal and re-unification decisions. Safety is not defined by determining the presence or absence of injuries. Safety is not subject to degree; a child is either safe or unsafe. A child is not somewhat safe or conditionally safe. The location of a child will not make a child safe. For example, just because a child is in a voluntary kinship arrangement, foster care, or living away from his/her primary residence, does not make the child safe. The governing question about child safety related to assessing safety is: Without intervention if this child were in his/her home would he/she be in a state of danger  would he/she be unsafe? The conclusion is not a suspicion; a general concern; an intuitive judgment. Safe - Children are considered safe when there are no identified present danger situations or impending danger safety threats, or caregiver protective capacities are sufficient to control existing danger. Unsafe - Children are considered unsafe when there is an identified present danger situation or impending danger safety threat, and caregiver protective capacities are insufficient to control existing danger.FORMS AND TOOLSCaregiver Protective Capacity ToolSafety Threats",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-19-case-management-section-1911-safety-assessment

See Practice Guidance: Additional Considerations in Special Investigations or Policy Violations Assessment. 4. Discuss history with the caregivers to obtain their perspective regarding the previous history, including correlation to current circumstances. 5. Document a summary of the analysis of DFCS history in Georgia SHINES: a. Dates of reports, allegations, dispositions and overall outcomes of intervention; b. A detailed description of how the historical information impacts the current assessment or decision; and c. The caregivers perspective of the history. The Social Services Supervisor (SSS) will: 1. Ensure the SSCM has analyzed all in-state and out-of-state child welfare history obtained from the safety screenings. 2. Review the DFCS history to support decision making. 3. Ensure that the SSCM has discussed the child welfare history with individuals, when applicable. 4. Provide guidance to the SSCM regarding the consideration of history in decision-making. 5. Review Georgia SHINES to ensure that the analysis and consideration of the child welfare history is documented. PRACTICE GUIDANCE Why is History Important History is often a predictor of future behavior and the information included in a familys DFCS history plays a significant role when making any decision concerning child safety during DFCS involvement with a family. History on household members as children and as adults should be analyzed and considered during all decision points of a case. Research has found that caregivers who were abused as children is a predictor for the caregivers to abuse their own children. Also, a history of problems, such as, chronic and/or untreated substance use and mental health disorders are risk factors for future child maltreatment. Reviewing and analyzing DFCS history can provide an abundance of information about a family and the level of intervention needed to assist the family with the challenges they are facing in everyday life tasks. Some of the information that can be gathered from a familys history includes, but is not limited to: 1. Family and caregiver strengths. 2. The familys cultural beliefs and values. 3. The underlying challenges that a family is currently facing. 4. The familys previous response to intervention and treatment strategies. 5. Support networks previously used to reduce or mitigate safety concerns, and the effectiveness of such supports.6. Traumatic events affecting family members. 7. Coping skills used by the family to deal with traumatic events. 8. Identifying relatives, family supports, or any information to assist with locating a parent, family or youth who cannot be located or have moved to an unknown location. A thorough analysis and deliberate consideration of the DFCS history of all caregivers and household members must be incorporated into decision-making throughout the life of a case. Chronicity When analyzing history, it is essential to consider the number of reports, reports that indicate progressively more serious concerns, reports with similar or the same concern, the type of maltreatment, etc. The chronicity of the maltreatment should be assessed when reviewing previous history. Chronicity is the frequency of the recurrence of maltreatment. Chronicity involves an assessment of the following areas: 1. Is there a history of sexual abuse of any family member as a victim or perpetrator? This includes both civil and criminal reports of sexual abuse in Georgia and other localities; regardless of the disposition or the role of the principles in those past reports. 2. Has there been a recent incident, or indication, of abuse (within last 6 months)? This question applies to any indication of abuse within the last 6 months and is not restricted to official agency reports. It may include statements from the child, family, community, professionals or others. 3. Has there been a prior child abuse investigation, regardless of finding? This includes any DFCS involvement in Georgia or in other states, regardless of the disposition. 4. Has any child been removed from the home by a protective service agency? This question applies to the court ordered removal of any child in Georgia or in other states. This also includes serious incidents in licensed foster/adoptive homes. 5. Has any prior incident resulted in a severe outcome? Indications of severe outcomes are those which require prompt medical attention; may require medical or psychiatric hospitalization; may endanger the child life; may cause permanent functional impairment, death, or disfigurement; and, sexual intercourse or sexual acts performed with a child.Discussing DFCS History with the Caregiver The analysis and consideration of history provides additional evidence to support the safety and case determination and permanency decision. Obtaining the caregivers perspective about the agencys previous involvement will allow DFCS to: 1. Gather additional information. 2. Clarify any inaccuracies in the information. 3. Assess the caregivers ownership and honesty about past problems. NOTE: Caregivers who do not admit to having problem behaviors are less likely to work towards changing those behaviors. Knowing their perspective can assist in determining strategies for engagement and building partnership. Additional Considerations in Special Investigations or Policy Violations Assessment When analyzing DFCS case history, information regarding the approval and history of the placement resource (foster care kinship placement, foster of adoptive homes, Child Placing Agencies (CPA), Child Caring Institutions (CCI), etc.) must also be considered and includes: 1. Foster care stages for each alleged child victim in DFCS custody stages; 2. The foster or adoptive parents case record (FAD); 3. Information on a kinship placement available; ans 4. CPA/CCI resource information.FORMS AND TOOLS Analyzing and Assessing DFCS History Tool",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-19-case-management-section-1910-analyzing-dfcs-history

In addition, at re-evaluation an existing caregiver may have substantiated CPS history where a waiver has been granted from the State Office Placement and Permanency Section for the home to remain open for the sole purpose of permanency for a specific child.There is a current, open CPS investigation;  A caregiver has a history of unsubstantiated CPS investigations that revealed concerns related to safety or diminished caregiver protective capacity; An applicant who has previously been a caregiver or is an existing caregiver has two or more discipline (or other serious) policy violations; A caregivers home was previously closed due to the caregivers unwillingness to recognize the need for change or failure to cooperate with the agency; The name of a prospective or existing caregiver or an adult household member appears on a Sexual Offender Registry in Georgia or any other state; or There are unsatisfactory results from any safety screening source.Develop a process for each County Departments handling of safety screening after hours, on holidays and in emergency situations to ensure the screenings are conducted prior to the placement of children.PROCEDURESIntake Reports The Child Protective Services Intake Communication Center (CICC) Social Services Case Manager (SSCM) will: Conduct safety screenings on every intake report received with the exception of Information and Referrals. Add additional household members identified when conducting safety screenings to the Intake Assessment in Georgia SHINES and document in the Comments section they were added independent of the reporters initial information. Review and analyze all DFCS history and document how prior history was considered in the decision (see policy 19.10 Case Management: Analyzing DFCS History). Document safety screenings results in the Record Check Summary or Record Check Detail page in Georgia SHINES. Notify the County Department upon case assignment of the need to complete the outstanding safety screenings when technology issues prevent the CICC from completing the required safety screenings.Voluntary Kinship or TAFC Caregivers The County Department will: Conduct safety screenings on voluntary kinship or TAFC caregivers and all their household members. Review and analyze any DFCS history to assess protective capacities and their ability to care for the child (see policy 19.10 Case Management: Analyzing DFCS History). Document the safety screenings results in the Record Check Summary or Record Check Detail page in Georgia SHINES.Kinship Caregivers in Foster Care The County Department will: Conduct safety screenings on the kinship caregivers and their adult (18 years or older) household members prior to approval for placement of a child in foster care. If the safety screenings indicate the caregiver or any adult household member has child welfare history: Review and analyze the child welfare history to gather information about the caregiver(s) protective capacities and his/her ability to care for the child(ren) (see policy 19.10 Case Management: Analyzing DFCS History). NOTE: Caregivers who have questions about the child welfare history provided by another state should be directed to contact the other state agency for case information. If the DFCS record is missing, lost, or has been purged, conduct an interview with the individual who is the subject of the child welfare history to ascertain the nature of the history (what occurred, who was involved, whether services were provided, and any other information about the case). Document the interview on the Contact Detail and in the Record Check Detail pages in Georgia SHINES. The County Director will make the kinship caregiver approval decision, and within ten business days of the decision submit for 2nd level approval to the State Caregiver Recruitment and Retention Unit (CRRU) at DFCS-Waivers@dhs.ga.gov. If the DFCS record is missing, lost, or has been purged, include with the request a narrative of the interview with the individual subject to the child welfare history. Document the safety screenings results in the Record Check Summary or Record Check Detail page in Georgia SHINES.Foster or Adoptive Homes at Initial and Re-Evaluation  DFCS Foster or Adoptive Homes The Resource Development (RD) SSCM will: Direct prospective and existing caregivers and their adult (18 years or older) household members to complete the Child Abuse Screening Request Information form and Prior Caregiver Service Report and return it to the designated RD team member within five business days. Determine the need to request an out-of-state CAN Registry check. If an out-of-state registry check is required, the information must be received and considered prior to proceeding with the safety screenings. Complete all required safety screenings. NOTE: Safety screenings are considered timely if conducted within 90 calendar days prior to the re-evaluation due date. Document the safety screening results in the Record Check Summary or the Record Check Detail page in Georgia SHINES.CPA Foster or Adoptive Homes The CPA staff will: Direct prospective and existing caregivers and their adult (18 years or older) household members to complete the Child Abuse Screening Request Information form and Prior Caregiver Service Report and return it to the designated CPA staff. Submit the safety screening request to the CPS Screening Unit via email at cpsscreening@dhs.ga.gov, include: A written request on agency letterhead indicating the purpose for the request; and  Child Abuse Screening Request Information form and Prior Caregiver Service Report completed and signed by the caregiver(s) and/or their adult household member(s). NOTE: A CPA may only submit request for safety screenings to the CPS Screening Unit. County DFCS offices are not permitted to respond to such requests.Review the summary of the safety screenings results from DFCS. Conduct a name search in the following databases, print and summarize the results: Sex Offender Registry: Sex Offender Search;Sexually Dangerous Predator Search; andAbsconder Search.  Board of Pardons and Parole; and Department of Corrections Offender Query. Document the safety screenings results in the prospective or existing caregivers file. Submit all the safety screening results to the CPA Director or Designee for review.The State Office CPS Screening Unit will: Accept safety screenings request from the CPA via email at cpsscreening@dhs.ga.gov for initial and re-evaluation of prospective and existing caregivers. Complete the required safety screenings, not conducted by the CPA provider. Review and analyze any DFCS history and summarize the results (see policy 19.10 Case Management: Analyzing DFCS History). Submit to the Office of Provider Management (OPM) within ten business days from the date of request: Safety screenings results; Summary of the DFCS history; and Caregiver approval recommendation. NOTE: OPM will make the final approval decision and notify the agency of the final approval decision.Initial Placement and Subsequent Foster Care/Adoption Placement Changes (including Respite) The County Department will: Obtain the following information from RD or CPA staff: Foster parent(s) name and address; Names of other adult (18 years or older) household members; and Resource ID and Person ID.  Conduct safety screenings to review and assess if the caregiver continues to be eligible for placements. Document the safety screening results in Georgia SHINES under the Contacts/Summaries Tab in the Foster Care Child (FCC) stage: Select Pre-placement as the Purpose of the contact; The foster parents name(s) and the name, age, and relationships to the foster parent for each household member;Date screening was conducted, databases screened, and results; and Recommendation for whether child can be placed in the home based on the results of the screening.Routine Caregivers The SSCM will: Conduct safety screenings on every individual who is or will be providing routine care for a child involved in an active DFCS case (Initial Safety Assessment, Investigation, Family Support Services, Family Preservation Services, Permanency). Review and analyze any DFCS history to make a decision regarding their ability to care for the child (see policy 19.10 Case Management: Analyzing DFCS History). Document the safety screening results in the Record Check Summary or Record Check Detail page in Georgia SHINES.Other States Public Agencies, Tribal Agencies, Courts and Adoptions for Specified Resources The State Office CPS Screening Unit will: Accept safety screening requests from other states public agencies (agencies similar to DFCS), tribal agencies, courts (court ordered), and adoptions for specified resources via email at georgiaadamwalshcheck@dhs.ga.gov, that include: A written request on the requesters agency letterhead indicating the reason for the request; and The Child Abuse Screening Request Information Form completed and signed by agency representative. Provide the safety screenings results to the requester.PRACTICE GUIDANCESafety screenings are a significant component of the overall assessment process and can be initiated any time during the life of the case, including at Intake, Initial Safety Assessment, Investigation, Family Support Services, Family Preservation Services and Foster Care (Permanency or Adoptions). Information gathered from safety screenings increases DFCS ability to ensure the safety of children. Safety screenings should not be considered simply as check-off items but used to provide critical information to determine a caregivers or prospective caregivers protective capacity. When gathering information about a family, assess whether or not expanded safety screenings are warranted. For instance, DFCS policy may only require checking child welfare records in other states pursuant to the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act when a person has lived outside of Georgia within the last five years. However, based on information gathered about a family, it may be determined that such a check is warranted on a person who lived in another state seven years ago. Best practice and professional judgment dictate going beyond minimum requirements when making safety assessments. For instance, a SSCM should carefully assess whether checking another states CPS records is warranted for applicants who live in Georgia but work in another state. Such a situation may present itself more often in Georgia counties that border other states and have applicants who engage in commerce, school, work, or other activities of daily living in both states.Safety Screening Databases Board of Pardons and Parole A database of offenders who have been released from confinement (prison) after he/she has served an appropriate portion of his/her prison sentence and will serve the remainder of the sentence in the community under state supervision and control. Generally, individuals included in this database are 16 years of age and older. The Board of Pardons and Parole database is available at https://papapps.pap.state.ga.us/paroleesearch/search/searchPage CLEAR® DFCS Family Locator Tool CLEAR® offers fast, efficient search technology that allows one to locate people and authenticate their identities. It verifies such essential personal information as name, current/previous addresses, social security numbers, telephone numbers, email addresses, and criminal history. CLEAR® reports may also include relatives, associates, neighbors, social media accounts and vehicle registrations. NOTE: CLEAR® reports contain personal identifiable information and should be keep confidential. CLEAR® reports cannot be uploaded in Georgia SHINES External Documentation as they may contain other persons information, who are not associated with the case. County Master Files - Legacy County master files include services card files, services computer files, paper files and other files or logs the County Department used for case tracking. These records may also include information related to DFCS history that has been expunged as a part of DFCS record retention policy. The county department will conduct the screening of the County Master Files as this information is not available outside of the county offices.  Department of Corrections Offender Query This website maintains history on individuals who have been incarcerated in the Georgia prison system. Generally, individuals included in this database are 16 years of age and older. The website is: http://www.dcor.state.ga.us/GDC/OffenderQuery/jsp/OffQryForm.jsp Gateway An integrated computer system that records information and generates benefits to a group of individuals applying for or using OFI benefits (TANF, FS and Medicaid). Information contained include the names, addresses, birth dates, Social Security numbers, household composition, income, and employment information. This information can be used to assess a financial means of providing and verify self-reported information from the caregivers Financial Statement for Resource Parenting. Georgia Medicaid Management Information System (GAMMIS) GAMMIS is used to determine if a child is receiving SSI, Medicaid, or services from Childrens Medical Services. In addition, the information obtained from Georgia Health Partnership (GHP) can assist the user in obtaining well-being information and completing the Targeted Case Management (TCM) billing process. A User ID and password is required to access GAMMIS. Contact the Countys security manager to obtain a User ID and password. The website is www.mmis.georgia.gov/portal/default.aspx.Georgia SHINES Georgia SHINES is the states automated child welfare information system implemented in June 2008. All child welfare case management information is recorded in the Georgia SHINES system and gives the user both historical and current information concerning a family, adult or child that is or has been involved with DFCS. The State of Georgia does not maintain a CAN registry; however, it conducts Georgia SHINES screening for CPS history.  IDS Online Master Index  Legacy System IDS Online provides historical child welfare case information in Georgia prior to Georgia SHINES implementation. Once screened and the results are documented in Georgia SHINES, future reports involving the same individual will not require additional screening in this resource. IDS Online is available at https://idsonline.smipc.net/ IDS Placement Central  Legacy System IDS Placement Central provided the physical location of all children in DFCS custody prior to Georgia SHINES implementation. IDS Placement Central also maintained a database of all providers caring for children in the custody of the DFCS. The information from this database maybe helpful in making placement decisions by providing previous placement information for a child that may assist in identifying the needs of the child. Once screened and the results are documented in Georgia SHINES, future reports involving the same individual will not require additional screening in this resource. IDS Online is available at https://idsonline.smipc.net/ Out-of-State Child Abuse and Neglect (CAN) Registry A child abuse and neglect registry is a centralized database of child abuse and neglect investigation records for the state. Registries assist in the identification and protection of abused and neglected children and are typically used to aid child welfare agencies in the investigation, treatment, and prevention of child abuse cases and to maintain statistical information for staffing and funding purposes. The type of information contained in central registries and length of time the information is held varies from state to state but usually includes the childs name and address; the name of the mother, father, or guardian; the name of any siblings; the nature of the harm to the child; the name of the alleged perpetrator(s); and the findings of any investigations. Protective Services Data System (PSDS)  Legacy System PSDS is a historical list of child abuse and neglect incidents in Georgia from the period of 1991 through January 01, 2003. This includes date reported, case name, case number and case determination. It is necessary to review the case information to determine if an individual is identified as a maltreater. PSDS is available at https://idsonline.smipc.net/ Sex Offender RegistryThe sex offender registry is a database of individuals who has been convicted of a criminal offense against a victim who is a minor or any dangerous sexual offense; Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) is the central repository for Georgia's Violent Sexual Offender Registry. The sexual offender records are entered on the registry by the Department of Corrections and State Board of Pardons and Paroles. The GBI enters the sexual offender records for the sexual offenders who relocate to Georgia from another state. The GBI Sex Offender Registry search option all compiles results from sexual offenders, sexually dangerous predators, and absconders; incarcerated offenders are excluded when location criteria is provided.

Users can search for specific cases using Case ID, Case Name, Case Manager (name), facility name, stage type, and additional criteria. When the search criteria do not yield a match, perform another search using different criteria. Foster/Adoptive (F/A) Homes Search F/A homes search is used to search for a non-DFCS or DFCS foster or adoptive homes, Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children (ICPC) homes, and relative homes. In addition to completing the normal search parameters on an F/A home, a search should also be conducted using the providers resource ID in Georgia SHINES which should identify any prior incidents involving the F/A home and the outcome of the investigation or policy violation assessment. Searches can also be conducted for homes that are in inquiry status. Person Search A person search is used to search for a person in any stage. A person search can be performed using any of the following identifying information: Date of birth Full name Partial first and last (only the first three letters are needed) Phonetic Address Social Security number Person ID CRS or Medicaid/MHN Number NOTE: Use the least amount of information and try multiple searches before determining a person does not exist in Georgia. Resource Search Resource search is used to search for resources in the Resource Directory. Resource search includes providers, law enforcement, hotlines/help lines, schools, mental and behavioral health facilities and home/other facilities. The resource search page provides the user with multiple methods to conduct a search for providers. Search options include name, specific identifiers, services provided and location. NOTE: Resources may have multiple contracts in Georgia SHINES. The user needs to review all matches to select the best resource that matches.CPS Screening Unit The CPS Screening Unit is responsible for conducting safety screenings and Adam Walsh requests for prospective foster parent(s), current foster parent(s) re-evaluations, and substitute caregivers to obtain a thorough background history for the purpose of making an approval recommendation.FORMS AND TOOLSAdam Walsh State Contact ListChild Abuse Screening Request InformationChild Abuse Screening Request Information - SampleCLEAR® Address & Household Composition VerificationOverview of Search Functionality  Georgia SHINES Job Aid",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-19-case-management-section-199-safety-screenings

Documents containing such responses are to be treated as official CHRI. Maintain a CHRI log in each DFCS office and have a unique sheet for each criminal history record currently maintained in a secured location. The log shall be stored with other secured CHRI files. Maintain CHRI for a minimum of three years for GBI/FBI audit purposes. Emergency placement inquiries (i.e., those run after normal business hours) require the use of Purpose Code X. The individual whose criminal history record was requested MUST BE FINGERPRINTED within five business days. A completed Live Scan application is required and must be presented by the applicant to the Electronic Fingerprint Technician (EFT) prior to a fingerprint-based CRC being initiated.Each Child Protective Services (CPS) CHRI inquiry must be linked to an official investigation involving child neglect, abuse, or exploitation; therefore, a copy of the initial CPS report related to the specific inquiry must be provided to the OIG at the time of the request. The appropriate consent form must be used for each CRC and maintained in the case record. The Consent for Criminal Records Check (Form 404) provides consent for a local/Georgia name-based CRC (GCIC only). The Live Scan Application Form provides consent for a national fingerprint based CRC (NCIC & GCIC).Conduct a check of the GCIC crime information databases on adult household members as needed when providing Child Protective Services (CPS), including when assessing Safety Resources and Temporary Alternatives to Foster Care. Conduct a check of national and state crime information databases (as defined in section 534(f)(3)(A) of title 28, United States Code) utilizing electronic fingerprinting (Live Scan) on any prospective foster and adoptive parent before the applicant may be finally approved for placement of a child, regardless of whether foster care maintenance payments or adoption assistance payments are to be made on behalf of the child. This includes all adults (age 18 and over) residing in the home (permanently or temporarily) who have access to children placed in the home. Require a fingerprint-based check of national crime information databases (as defined in section 534(f)(3)(A) of title 28, United States Code) be conducted on any adult working in a child caring institution (CCI), including a group home, residential treatment center, shelter, or other congregate care setting where children in DFCS custody are placed (see policy 16.8 Room Board Watchful Oversight: Minimum Standards). Not approve any prospective foster or adoptive parent or claim Federal Financial Participation (FFP) for any foster care maintenance or adoption assistance payment made on behalf of a child placed in a foster home operated under the auspices of a Child Placing Agency (CPA) or on behalf of a child placed in an adoptive home through a private adoption agency if DFCS finds (in any case involving a child on whose behalf such payments are to be made), via a criminal records check conducted in accordance with the above requirement, that a court of competent jurisdiction has determined that the prospective foster or adoptive parent has been convicted of a felony involving: Child abuse or neglect; Spousal abuse; A crime against a child or children (including child pornography); or A crime involving violence, including rape, sexual assault, or homicide (but not including other physical assault or battery). Not approve any prospective foster or adoptive parent or claim FFP for any foster care maintenance or adoption assistance payment made on behalf of a child placed in a foster home operated under the auspices of a CPA or on behalf of a child placed in an adoptive home through a private adoption agency if DFCS finds (in any case involving a child on whose behalf such payments are to be made), via a criminal records check conducted in accordance with the above requirement, that a court of competent jurisdiction has determined that the prospective foster or adoptive parent, within the last five years, has been convicted of a felony involving:Physical assault; Battery; or A drug or alcohol related offense.Conduct a check of the GCIC crime information databases on substitute caregivers providing routine care (more than once a week, usually at designated times) for children in DFCS custody. EXCEPTION: A letter from Department of Early Care and Learning (DECAL) issued within the previous 12 months stating that the substitute caregiver has received a satisfactory CRC determination may be accepted in lieu of a new CRC. Allow an exception to the fingerprinting requirement for persons with a physical disability that makes it impossible to obtain their fingerprints. In such instances, a national name-based or social security number-based CRC must be completed. A waiver is required from the DFCS Regional Director (for DFCS) or the Placement and Permanency Services Director (for CPAs) and is for limited, case-specific situations such as the following: a. When the subject has no fingers; b. When a person trained to take fingerprints has documented that the subjects disabling condition prevents fingerprinting; or c. When a qualified medical practitioner has documented that the subjects disabling condition prevents fingerprinting. NOTE: This exception does not apply to persons who can be printed, but the quality of the fingerprints is poor. Ensure that a fingerprint-based CRC is conducted every five years on each foster and/or adoptive parent (prior to an adoptive placement). Use a fingerprint-based CRC only for the purpose for which it was originally intended. Ensure a CRC is conducted within 30 calendar days on any new household member 18 years of age and older, as well as any current household member who attains 18 years of age. Continue to be responsible for the security and integrity of Criminal History Records Information (CHRI) received before September 1, 2013.Follow the following guidelines regarding dissemination of CHRI: Refrain from disseminating any CHRI outside of the Department of Human Services (DHS) or across state lines. When CHRI is disseminated within DHS, the recipient must have successfully completed Georgias Security Awareness Training and have a current Georgia Crime Information Awareness Statement on file with his/her manager. When CHRI is disseminated within DHS, the sender must complete a secondary log that includes the date, time, GBI Transaction Control Number (TCN), the name of the individual referenced in the CHRI, the name of the recipient of the CHRI, and the reason the CHRI was disseminated. NOTE: Refer to Room Board and Watchful Oversight Minimum Standards for Child Placing Agencies and Child Care Institutions in policy 16.8 Room Board Watchful Oversight: Minimum Standards for CRC procedures for Child Placing Agency (CPA) foster and adoptive homes and CCIsPROCEDURESWhen requesting a statewide name-based CRC only, the county DFCS will: Request the individual(s) for whom the CRC is being requested to complete and sign the Consent for Criminal Records Check (Form 404). During business hours, send an email with the signed Consent for Criminal History Records Check (Form 404) to DFCS-GCIC@dhs.ga.gov or a fax to 404-463-0873.When requesting a national (NCIC) fingerprint-based CRC, the county DFCS will: Complete the Live Scan Application Form for a state and federal fingerprint-based CRC and ensure: All fields are completed; A service authorization number is provided for internal accounting purposes; A finance/UAS code is provided for GBI billing and payment purposes; The application form is authorized by the DFCS official; and The applicant presents valid government issued photo identification. Forward the completed and authorized Live Scan Application Form to the Electronic Fingerprint Technician (EFT). The EFT is not authorized to capture fingerprints if all items in procedure one above are not completed. Make an appointment with the EFT to complete the applicants Live Scan. Carefully review the applicants CHRI provided by the EFT to make a fitness determination. Negative findings are to be reviewed with the Supervisor and County Director/Designee. Any reported offenses are to be fully explored with the parties involved. Factors, including the following, are to be weighed during the review process: Nature of the activity; When the activity occurred; Length of time since last occurrence; Specific circumstances involved; Applicants lifestyle in recent years; and Likelihood of recidivism, etc. Only allow CHRI to be accessed by DFCS staff who have successfully completed Security Awareness Training and have a current GCIC Awareness Statement on file in their home office. Current means within the last two years. Maintain a log of CHRI received, shared, and destroyed. Document a discussion of negative findings and justification for approval, if granted. When applicable, provide a CPA with written confirmation that a CRC has been conducted on a youth who reaches 18 years of age while residing in the CPA foster home and be prepared to discuss negative findings that would impact the safety of anyone in the home.The Electronic Fingerprint Technician (EFT) will: Capture and process fingerprints; Transmit the fingerprints through a secure server to the GBI/ FBI for the CRC; Receive each applicants CHRI;Upload the CHRI into External Documentation in Georgia SHINES. There must be a case number related to the applicant in Georgia SHINES for the CHRI to be uploaded.If the applicant is not related to a case number, or a new EFT has not yet received authorization to access Georgia SHINES, a criminal history summary is completed by the EFT and sent to the Point of Contact (POC) for the individual agency.Criminal Records Checks for Emergency and After-Hours Placement When a CRC is required to secure immediate placement for a child under exigent circumstances involved in a DFCS case, this situation is an emergency and requires use of OIG Emergency On-Call procedures. An exigent circumstance is an emergency, pressing necessity, or set of circumstances requiring immediate attention. The child must be in DFCS custody and cannot be placed prior to request of an afterhours CRC. After normal business hours, DFCS must call the OIG Emergency on-call number at 404-798-0217 and request a CRC for an emergency. During normal business hours, email the CRC request to DFCS-GCIC@dhs.ga.gov. The emergency on-call operator will conduct a Purpose Code X (name-based) CRC for each adult in the placement household. A copy of the law enforcement notification version of the CPS Intake Report must be provided to OIG (if the request takes place as part of a CPS case). The individual whose criminal records history was requested must be fingerprinted within five business days as mandated by federal and state law governing the use of Purpose Code X. This process must be followed without exception. If at any time within the five business-day period any adult in the placement refuses to complete the fingerprint-based CRC, the child must be removed from the home immediately.PRACTICE GUIDANCECriminal History Record Information (CHRI) CHRI is information collected by criminal justice agencies on individuals consisting of identifiable descriptions and notations of arrests, detentions, indictments or other formal criminal charges and any disposition arising therefrom, including acquittal, sentencing, correctional supervision, and release (GCIC Council Rule 140-1-02). The following documents are considered CHRI: Criminal history fingerprint cards; Final disposition reports; Record of Arrest and Prosecution (RAP sheet), including Live Scan responses; and Criminal history information received from the OIG Background Investigations Unit (BIU).Georgia Crime Information Center (GCIC) GCIC is the division of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) that maintains the database that contains Georgia Criminal History Records Information (CHRI). It is the access point for federal CHRI. GCIC is responsible for ensuring compliance with both state and federal rules for the use, security, and dissemination of CHRI. Failure to abide by federal and state laws, federal rules and regulations, and GCIC rules regarding access, use, and dissemination of information available via the Criminal Justice Information System (CJIS) Network may result in criminal prosecution by the GBI and/or administrative sanctions by the GCIC.National Crime Information Center (NCIC) The NCIC maintains the database that contains national criminal history records information.Originating Agency Identifier (ORI) The ORI number is assigned by the FBI to non-criminal justice agencies (e.g., DFCS) authorized by Georgia and federal law to obtain a national criminal history records check. It is a unique identifier assigned to each County Office.Georgia Applicant Processing Service (GAPS) The GBI has contracted with Gemalto to provide electronic fingerprint submission services for applicants in the State of Georgia. This is utilized by CPAs, not DFCS. GAPS provides the ability for applicants to have fingerprint-based background checks processed electronically in a non-criminal justice environment (i.e., DFCS office). GAPS provides fixed office locations throughout the state so that Georgia residents will not have to travel more than 25 to 30 miles to a GAPS office. Search results of the fingerprint-based background check, as well as RAP sheets, are available for the agency to retrieve from the GAPS website within 24 to 48 hours after the applicant is fingerprinted and the transaction is submitted to GCIC for processing. Any Georgia agency or business that holds an ORI or Georgia OAC number may participate in the GAPS program. However, the agency must enroll with Gemalto to utilize GAPS.Security Awareness Training Security Awareness Training provides employees with a working knowledge of federal and state regulations and laws governing the security and integrity of CHRI. All DFCS employees must complete the training every two years. New DFCS employees must complete the training within the first 60 days of employment. Security Awareness Training is provided in a video format taken via the computer-based training (CBT) platform. The training satisfies the GBIs compliance requirement with FBI policy. It includes a test that produces a certificate and a Georgia Crime Information Awareness Statement that must be signed and kept on file by an employees department.Managing CHRI Each County Office should designate an agency representative to receive and safeguard the results of each records search. This designee must have successfully completed the required Security Awareness training within the past two years and have a signed GCIC Awareness Statement on file with the County Office. CHRI must be kept in a secure location under lock and key. CHRI must be signed in and signed out when physically transferred to another DFCS office. The person receiving the CHRI at the other DFCS office must also have successfully completed the Security Awareness training within the past two years and have a signed GCIC Awareness Statement on file in their home County Office. The person receiving CHRI from another DFCS office must sign it in on their log. During an audit, DFCS must be able to clearly show the tracking of CHRI as it changes location. When a fingerprint-based CRC is requested, the results must be sent to the DFCS office whose ORI number was used on the request. After it is received and logged in at that office, the results may then be signed out to another office using the required security and integrity procedures.Destruction of CHRI When no longer required, all documents containing CHRI must be destroyed to prevent access by unauthorized persons. Record destruction must be conducted in a secure manner under the supervision of authorized persons. The only GCIC approved method of disposal or destruction of CHRI is to shred it using a cross-cut shredder. The destruction of any CHRI must be noted in the CHRI log. The GBI #, FBI #, date, time, and name of person disposing/destroying the records must be specifically noted on the individual log sheet for each record.DHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) Background Investigations Unit (BIU) The OIG has Live Scan operators available across the state of Georgia to complete fingerprinting for DFCS (including after-hours) seven days a week.

How engaged was the family in identifying FLOs, ILOs, and developing action plans? (See policy 19.1 Case Management: Milestones of Solution Based Casework.)Review the progress or barriers to the achievement of the case plan outcomes and the need for any changes or updates. Validate that the family is making improvements by reviewing the documentation related to the evidence of new behaviors by the family (e.g. the familys daily journal, the familys chores chart, the observation of progress in visitations, or the familys appointment calendar confirming that appointments were accomplished). NOTE: Noticing and Documenting Change is a Milestone 4. Discuss strategies to engage the family in overcoming barriers to achieving FLOs and/or ILOs (see policy 19.14 Case Management: Action Planning). Develop the professional competencies of the SSCM by eliciting recommendations and solutions for case management strategies. Coach the SSCM to reframe his/her assessments that are problem saturated with what is not working for the family. Focus on exceptions when the family was able to successfully manage their challenges to mitigate safety concerns for the child. Guide the SSCM through the process of establishing and assessing sufficiency of case contact standards to ensure child safety (see policy 19.15 Case Management: Developing Contact Standards for Purposeful Contacts and Collaterals Contacts). Discuss the service needs that were identified jointly with the family and the familys input on the most effective way to meet the needs. Also discuss: Any additional service needs identified by the SSCM that impact child safety or wellbeing; for which, the family is unable to recognize the needs or resistant to change. Recommendations on how to motivate the family to accept the service recommendations and the safety interventions necessary in the meantime. Review the progress or treatment notes/reports from service providers related to their assessment of the family and determine whether they are meeting the identified needs (see policy 19.17 Case Management: Service Provision). Evaluate and assess case closure, as applicable and appropriate. Ensure that the SSCM has uploaded all supporting and relevant case documents (i.e. medical reports, psychological evaluations, photos, law enforcement reports, etc.) into Georgia SHINES, External Documentation within 72 hours of receipt of the documents. In conjunction with the SSCM, make a safety determination (see policy 19.11 Case Management: Safety Assessment).  Summarize what was discussed during the staffing by reviewing the next steps, including timeframes for follow up and ask if the SSCM has any remaining questions or needs clarification on any items. Provide feedback and clarity to the SSCM regarding expectations of any timeframes for case management accomplishments. Feedback should include among other items, an assessment of performance, praise for performance, and encouragement, as applicable. Schedule a date and time for the next staffing and conclude the staffing.Document the supervisor staffing in Georgia SHINES within 72 hours of the staffing. Provide feedback on case documentation in Georgia SHINES.PRACTICE GUIDANCEThe Supportive Role of a Supervisor Supervisors play an important role in increasing case manager motivation, job-related critical thinking, and decision-making skills, so that case managers can better serve children and families (Fisher, 2009; Lietz, 2010; Rzepnicki & Johnston, 2005). Additionally, research has shown that there is a relationship between quality supervision and the case managers increased capacity to define next steps and set limits in their cases (Banuch, 1999); which increased service provision (McGrew & Bond, 1997), led to stronger client engagement (particularly with resistant individuals) (Bibus, 1993), and improved goal attainment among clients (Harkness, 1995). Building a Partnership The SSS models how the SSCM should engage in partnership decision making with the family by engaging in partnership decision making with the SSCM. Just as the SSS listens to and elicits input from the SSCM to reach decisions, the SSCM listens to and elicits input from the family related to their developmental stage and their assessment of the challenges associated with that stage, as well as solutions to alleviate or reduce safety concerns accompanying the developmental stage. In Solution Based Casework (SBC) partnering with families has additional meaning. It means to partner with families to establish safety for their children. Partnering with families is always the responsibility of the SSCM when working to achieve this goal. When partnering with families is difficult because of challenges or resistance, the SSCM must reassess his/her approach and practice strategies. The SSS plays a critical role in helping the SSCM reframe what is perceived as family resistance to refocus his/her approach in engaging the family and building partnership.Using Georgia SHINES Information to Inform Decision Making The SSS should review Georgia SHINES information (i.e. Case Watch, Alerts, Health Information, Record Checks, etc.) related to their programmatic area with the SSCM during the staffing. This information helps to inform practice through: Assessing case management tasks and progress; Assessing individual case progress; Targeting service delivery; and Providing feedback to the Social Services Case Managers (SSCM)Making an Informed DecisionMaking an informed decision is not based on assumptions but on the evidence obtained to support the decision being made. The combination of comprehensive information gathering, critical thinking, policy guidelines and partnership aids in making an informed decision. The principles related to informed decision making include the following: Framing the question behind the decision Was the question clearly defined before gathering information? Finding sources of information Have we spoken to everyone internally and externally with information related to the decision?Have we reviewed data systems and documents that can provide supporting evidence?Assessing the accuracy of information How reliable and valid is the information that was obtained? Assessing the applicability of information Does the information apply to the current decision? Does the information support or refute the concerns? How does the information apply to the context of the familys culture? How current is the information that was obtained? Assessing whether the information is actionable Does the information require urgent or emergent action? Determining if the information is adequate  Is the information comprehensive? Is additional information needed to make a decision? Does it support the decision that is being made?Partnership Decision Making The SSS must always staff the following situations with the SSCM: When the SSCM is assigned an Initial Safety Assessment (ISA) and prior to the SSCM making contact with the child and family. Modifications to assigned response times. During contact with the child(ren) and family at the ISA to make a safety determination. After contact with the child(ren) and family to make a track assignment. Upon conclusion of the CPS investigation to make the maltreatment and safety determinations. When a child(ren) is determined to be unsafe, which interventions will ensure the child(ren)s protection in the least intrusive manner possible. When developing, modifying or changing safety, family or case plans. Before a child is placed in out-of-home care, and before a reunification recommendation is made. When changing or modifying the placement arrangements or permanency goals. At the point of case closure, to evaluate the familys progress toward achieving and maintaining behavioral changes for child(ren) safety and well-being.After the SSCM and SSS have discussed the information that was gathered, they must weigh the evidence to reach a case decision or action. The available evidence should clearly support the decision. SSCMs should approach the monthly supervisor staffing with professional recommendations and next steps based on the evidence that they have obtained. The evidence that was obtained should be clearly documented in Georgia SHINES to support the recommendation. Sometimes situations may arise that make it difficult for the SSS and SSCM to agree on a case decision or action when the evidence is equally weighted. In these situations, the SSS and SSCM should strive to reach consensus on the decision (i.e. request the perspective of another supervisor; jointly seek consultation from the county, regional or state office leadership; request a safety roundtable; etc.). The SSS and SSCM should present the evidence that supports their recommendation of the case decision or action. Ultimately, the agencys decision, along with the supporting evidence, should be documented in Georgia SHINES. SSCMs should never document disagreements with their SSS in Georgia SHINES. Most importantly, differences in opinions should never interfere with the safety or well-being of children or the needs of the family.Additional Areas to Assess During Program Specific Supervisor StaffingIntakeSafety screenings have been completed and assessed, per policy, including maiden and married names of household members. Whether the report was received via phone call, email, or fax. The attempts to gather information.The need to contact the reporter for additional information. The recommended response time and the justification for it. Corrections needed in the intake report, as applicable. The notification of the report to agencies with oversight of the placement, as applicable. The rationale for assigning a different response time from the recommendation of the SSCM, as applicable.ISADate/time of the response and any barriers to meeting the assigned response time. Any additional areas of maltreatment identified during the contact that were not contained in the intake report. The need to contact the reporter for additional information Were safe sleep practices discussed with any caregiver who has an infant (birth to 12 months of age) in the home and addressed prior to leaving the home. Observe children for physical signs of maltreatment in accordance with policy 4.3 Initial Safety Assessment: Purposeful Contacts During the Initial Safety Assessment. Any known or suspected victims of sex trafficking were reported to law enforcement within 24 hours of identification. Recommended areas to assess and potential collateral contacts, as applicable, based on the information contained in the intake report. The safety of the Social Services Case Manager (SSCM). The need for an interpreter and/or assistive tools for families with limited English proficiency or sensory impairment.The need for assistance from other DFCS staff (i.e. the permanency case manager or RD case manager). Cultural competence practice, as applicable. Assistive tools to interview children or adults with cognitive or developmental delays. Protocols with other agencies (i.e. military installations, county child abuse protocol, child fatality review teams. Motor vehicle safety recommendations including hot car safety with caregivers.

Summarize the activities of the Case Consultation team and ensure that everyone is clear on the expectations and goals going forward. 5. Ensure that any documents provided at the Case Consultation are reviewed and uploaded into External Documentation in SHINES within 72 hours of the Case Consultation. PRACTICE GUIDANCE Solution Based Casework (SBC) posits that child safety and well-being are endangered when families cannot successfully manage the everyday life tasks associated with the stage of the family developmental cycle that family is currently functioning in. In order to create safe environments for children to thrive in, caregivers have to gain insight into how their thinking affects their feelings; which in turn, is manifested in their behaviors. Child welfare staff and community based providers must focus their approach on the familys strengths, competency and the times when the family was able to successfully meet the developmental needs of the child and family (problem exceptions). This empowers the family to work in partnership with child welfare staff and community based providers to address the challenges faced in their everyday life tasks in order to keep their children safe. Family Composition A genogram is an illustration of familial relationships over time. It is valuable for obtaining information about the family, assessing relationship dynamics and behavioral patterns, guiding intervention strategies and assisting families with insight into their familial connections. Genograms also help to identify family strengths and needs throughout generations. The Case Consultation Team (CCT) must remain conscientious of the need to honor and respect culturally different views, beliefs, attitudes, values and systems in which families raise their children. Differences in parenting styles and practices should not necessarily be viewed from a deficit perspective, but should be assessed in context of the cultural norms of the family. What may be viewed as a deficiency in one culture may be regarded as a strength in another culture. The CCT should give equal weight to the familys views on how to solve the problems of the family. The CCT should brainstorm ways to assist families in gaining insight into their beliefs and behavioral practices that place children in unsafe situations. This empowers families to develop new skills that they can maintain once they are no longer actively involved with the child welfare system. Family IssuesIt is important for CCT to identify the developmental stage that the family is currently in and the everyday tasks associated with the stage. All families, whether or not they are involved with the child welfare system, experience common challenges related to everyday life situations involving parenting (e.g. potty training, school attendance, dating, household rules, financial support, health issues and conflict). When these challenges pose a threat to the basic care and safety of children, then the child welfare system must intervene. The CCT uses the Social Services Case Manager (SSCM)s work of tracking the sequence of events that brought the family to the attention of the child welfare system to gain awareness into what the family has tried that is working and what is not working. This will lead to the identification of Family Level Issues or Concerns. It is important to assess the issues or concerns for safety; which will help to identify Family Level Outcomes (FLO). In situational domestic violence, the FLO is secondary to the Individual Level Outcome (ILO) because safety must be assured as the primary focus. FLO should not be completed on sexual abuse cases at all because sexually abusive behavior is not normalized as a component of managing the everyday family developmental stages, but is the result of uncontrolled personal behavior that victimizes a child.Individual Issues Just as many children in the child welfare system have experienced different kinds of trauma, many birth parents involved with child welfare services have their own histories of childhood and/or adult trauma. Untreated traumatic stress has serious consequences for children, adults, and families. Traumatic events in childhood and adolescence can continue to impact adult life, affecting an adults ability to regulate emotions, maintain physical and mental health, engage in relationships, parent effectively, and maintain family stability. Parents past or present experiences of trauma can affect their ability to keep their children safe, to work effectively with child welfare staff, and to respond to the requirements of the child welfare system. The CCT Team will assess the behavioral problems or patterns of behavior that the caregivers exhibit which impact the safety or well-being of the child(ren). Assess the identified Individual Level Issues or Concerns based on the safety to the child, in order to identify the Individual Level Outcomes (ILO). How does the adult in the home function in regards to daily life management and protective capacities? Assess the caregiver with the high risk behavior, as well as, any other adults in the home with caregiving responsibilities. Review the assessments/reports of other professionals related to the behaviors of the adults, such as mental health providers, law enforcement, and interviews with relatives or friends. CASES (criminal activity; anger/control issues; substance abuse; emotional stability; and sexually abusive patterns is the acronym used to categorize the five major problems) that families present with when encountering the child welfare system. Family Strengths and Skills Assessing a familys strengths and skills is a continuous process, conducted jointly with the family, throughout the life of a child welfare case. The CCT should review and discuss the assessment of the familys strengths and skills that have been completed up to the point of the Case Consultation. Assess the ways in which the strengths and skills can be utilized to safely maintain the child in the family or to safely return the child to the family. Consensus About Direction Consensus centers on separating the intentions of the caregiver from the actions of the caregiver by normalizing the developmental challenges of the family and externalizing the problem behavior (while not minimizing it), so that the family and Social Services Case Manager (SSCM) can work together to address the problem behavior without the caregiver focusing on defending himself or herself against the stigma of the behavior. Reviewing the family history is important; however, it must be assessed in the context of its impact on the current problem. The CCT will need to understand and recognize how the family has attempted to solve their problems in the past as stated in the familys language or narrative of the problem. Evaluate whether the familys language adequately assesses the old problematic behaviors and adequately addresses the new desired behaviors",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-19-case-management-section-195-case-consultation

This allows for a thorough assessment and analysis of family conditions and further ensures that the current DFCS intervention is meeting the familys needs currently and will continue to meet the needs moving forward. Supervisors participate in case transfer staffing to provide guidance, approve current and proposed case management activities. Many times, families frequently move from county to county. When this occurs, it is imperative that services and contact with the family are maintained as much as possible. As such, the County that has primary responsibility for the case should maintain the primary case management responsibilities in Georgia SHINES until it can be confirmed that the family has settled in another county. The primary county may request assistance from other counties in making contact with the family to confirm their residency, however, official case transfer should not occur until it is clear that the family will remain in their new residence ongoing. This may require keeping the case beyond the timeframes outlined for case transfer in the above procedures. Should this occur, the decision to maintain the case pending confirmation of the familys residency in a new county should be documented in Georgia SHINES as a part of the Supervisory Staffing. When disagreements between the sending and receiving county DFCS offices occur, the situation should be referred to the appropriate County Director(s), and when necessary Regional Director(s) for resolution. Under no circumstances should case management activities cease, or a family not be contacted due to county jurisdiction issues. When multiple counties or other states are involved with a family and jurisdiction is initially undetermined, a staffing must occur between the counties to develop and implement a plan to address child safety and the familys needs pending jurisdiction resolution. Under no circumstances should the establishment of jurisdiction preclude the county in which the family resides from ensuring face-to-face contact and an assessment of safety. It is permissible to cross county lines while jurisdictional issues are resolved.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-19-case-management-section-194-case-transfer

Families must be fully engaged in the FTM process to ensure they are involved in decision-making. The goal of the FTM is to build consensus with the family about what needs to change to strengthen caregiver protective capacities and build natural supports that will sustain the family over time, and ensure child safety, permanency, and wellbeing. The Solution-Focused FTM format provides more flexibility by allowing preparation interviews to occur naturally as part of case management activities with the family, the structure of the FTM to be altered depending on stage of the case (i.e. in what Milestone), and to support SSCMs facilitating the FTM.Who Can Facilitate a Solution-Focused FTM All FTMs must be facilitated by an individual who has successfully completed Solution Focused FTM training. An FTM may be facilitated by the SSCM assigned to the case, or by a facilitator from a dedicated FTM Unit or county/regional assignment. A co-facilitator may also be utilized to assist in facilitating FTMs. In counties or regions where there are no formal FTM Facilitators, the SSCM may partner with a peer (another SSCM) to facilitate or co-facilitate each others FTMs as needed.Confidentiality Ensuring privacy and confidentiality is necessary for building family trust and demonstrating respect for the family. Trust is enhanced by informing all team members of the expectations to maintain confidentiality and what information is mandated to be reported by law: New allegations of suspected child abuse/neglect. A belief that an individual intends to harm herself/himself. A belief that a person intends to harm others.HIPAA DFCS staff, including interns and volunteers, shall comply with HIPAA. HIPAA establishes minimum federal standards for protecting the access, use and disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI). Refer to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996: TCA 37-3-105, 37-5-106 and policy 2.5 Information Management: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for specific information regarding obtaining authorization for the disclosure of protected health information during a FTM.Preparation for the FTM Successful FTMs require careful preparation of the family team regarding the purpose, roles and expected outcome. This may occur as a natural part of the case management activities or through a formal preparation interview. An important goal of preparing for the FTM is to engage and empower families in planning and decision-making. As much of the work to prepare a family occurs as part of ongoing case management interactions, SSCMs may move less formally through FTM preparation as needed. Preparation may occur face to face, using virtual technology, or by phone, if needed. A more formal Preparation Interview may be done when determined to best meet the familys needs. In either case, the FTM Preparation Interview Guidelines should be used by the SSCM to ensure that the family is fully prepared and has the supports they need. Preparation of the child/youth is just as important as preparing caregivers, regardless of whether their attendance to the FTM as children/youth have a unique perspective on their family circumstances. During the preparation process, provide age appropriate information regarding the purpose and goal of the process, the participants and their roles, and how the child/youths perspective benefits the family. Learning about the FTM process and purpose may help them understand that people are working to help their family. When determining whether the child/youth should attend the FTM, involve their caregivers in the decision-making to demonstrate respect and empower them while also providing the opportunity to assess and promote increased parental capacity.Family Team Members Family team members play an important role in supporting the family through safety planning and case planning during DFCS involvement and beyond. The family team members include the primary family members as well as formal and informal supports identified and/or agreed upon by the family for participation in case planning and decision-making. Family circumstances are unique and, therefore, the composition of each family team will vary. Primary family members must always be included for it to be considered an FTM. While in most situations, these include caregivers, children/youth and other adults, the SSCM and FTM Facilitator should work closely with the family to explore and identify who they consider as their family for inclusion in the FTM. Family team members includes, but is not limited to: Primary family members (parents, caregivers, child/youth) Kinship caregivers Foster parents, adoptive parents  Kinship resources (extended family, including maternal and paternal relatives, committed individuals with longstanding positive family like relationships with the child/family The Indian Tribe, if the child belongs to a Georgia tribe or federally recognized tribe. Family Supports (friends, neighbors, religious or faith-based/spiritual leaders/supports Child Placing Agency (CPA), Child Caring Institution (CCI), or Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facility (PRTF) staff CASA  GAL Service providers (CCFA, wraparound, DV/IPV, violence, mental health, substance abuse) DFCS staff (SSCM, SSS, Independent Living Specialist, Kinship Coordinators, Office of Financial Independence (OFI, etc.) Professionals from formal systems, such as schoolsRole of Family Team Members Parents/Caregiver: Parents/caregivers (including noncustodial parents) are experts on their familys strengths and needs, therefore their participation in the FTM is vital. Caregivers must be engaged in decision making regarding what will work to ensure the safety, wellbeing and permanency for their children, therefore their active input in development of safety interventions, outcomes and tasks for the case plan is essential. Children/Youth: The childs/youths voice is critical in case planning and decision making and should be included as a part of the FTM process. This can be accomplished in several ways depending on the individual family circumstances: Full or partial participation of the child/youth in the meeting (i.e., consider the emotional well-being of the child and whether they may be re-traumatized if present for the family story or other stages of the FTM). Encourage the child/youth to identify persons who they would like to participate to the FTM either as a support or as his/her representative. If the child cannot attend, ask him/her what issues he/she would like to have addressed (i.e., he/she may write a letter or make a list of things he/she would like to have discussed at the meeting.) Also, if there are critical decisions that will be made in the FTM, seek the child/youths input regarding such decisions.Invite someone who represents the childs best interest and who can serve as his/her support/advocate, such as a GAL or CASA. Relatives (Blood, Marriage or Adoption) and Kin: Relatives and/or kin can assist in engaging, encouraging, and empowering the family as they work on case plan goals and remain a sustainable support system after DFCS has closed the case. Having relatives and/or kin involved in the FTM process often gives them information and insight about family dynamics and functioning that they may have been unaware of and provides them an opportunity to participate in decision-making process and support child safety, permanency and wellbeing outcomes.Family Supports: Provide encouragement to the family as well as identify potential resources that may be available to help improve the familys challenging situation. Foster Parents/Adoptive Parents: The placement resource provides valuable information regarding the childs adjustment and progress at home and school, as well as information regarding child vulnerabilities. This is also an opportunity for the placement resource to partner with the DFCS and family in case planning and visitation while also learning information that can be helpful should they become the permanent resource for the child. CPA/CCI/PRTF: These providers play a key role in family engagement and service provision and must always be included in the FTM process. When a child/youth is placed with a CCI, CPA or PRTF, participation of their staff in the case planning and the decision-making process is critical, due to their consistent, ongoing and meaningful interactions with the caregiver and child/youth. CPA, CCI and PRTF staff should provide information regarding the childs adjustment to his/her placement and school, and treatment progress related to any identified child vulnerabilities.Guardian Ad Litem (GAL): The GAL is appointed by the Court to protect the best interest of the child he/she represents. Therefore, they are an integral member of the family team and should be included in discussions that impact the child during the case planning process for children in foster care. CASA: Gain first-hand knowledge of the work being done by the family and hear the family voice with the knowledge and wisdom gained from participating in services to provide valuable support for the family in court. Participation in the team allows the CASA to feel added confidence in supporting the teams recommendations to the court regarding permanency for the child. Comprehensive Child and Family Assessment (CCFA) Provider: The CCFA provides an overview of the assessments conducted, identified needs/services, recommendations for the permanency plan or concurrent permanency plan, and other information required for the social study outlined in policy 10.23 Foster Care: Case Planning. Independent Living Program Services: For youth eligible or involved in the Independent Living Program, the ILS can provide information regarding the Written Transitional Living Plan (WTLP) and/or Transition Plan progress. Kinship Coordinators: For familys that have kinship caregivers, they can provide support through identifying resources and advocate to ensure these caregivers have what they need to support the child/youth. OFI: OFI brings resources and information that can assist the family in meeting related outcomes and tasks. Some benefits to OFI participation are that they: Bring a different perspective to the team. Have specific knowledge to address individual cases/needs. Are knowledgeable of the family make-up and support system. Can answer questions and provide on-the-spot services to the family. Service Providers/Community Partners: The FTM provides a unique opportunity for community and service providers involved with the family to help determine what advocacy or support the family needs to meet case plan outcomes. They can provide recommendations regarding treatment or can identify additional community resources that can further assist the family. They can discuss the level of progress made through service provision that have had a direct impact on safety or permanency outcomes.Attorneys While the FTM is not a legal meeting/hearing and there is no policy requirement to include or exclude attorneys in the FTM, there may be instances when caregivers make specific requests to have their attorney present at an FTM. A caregiver has the right to request and have his/her attorney present; however, he/she should be reminded that the FTM is not a legal proceeding, and the purpose of the FTM should be reiterated. The SSCM should invite the Special Assistance Attorney General (SAAG) to attend if the caregivers attorney plans to attend the FTM. If other attorneys (i.e., the Guardian Ad Litem, Child Advocate, etc.) request to attend an FTM, the family must be informed of such requests for participation so that they can be included in the decision-making regarding the benefits of such participation. If any attorney is included in the FTM, the FTM Facilitator must ensure that adequate preparation is conducted with the attorney, informing them of the purpose of the meeting and that it is not a legal proceeding as well as the importance of adhering to the FTM model and what their role might be in the meeting.Building Consensus in the FTM A consensus-driven decision-making process does not necessarily imply unanimity. Consensus allows individuals ideas and suggestions to be heard and considered during the FTM meeting. To help with building consensus1 during the FTM: Affirm the common goal of ensuring child safety, permanency and well-being, and everyones interest and commitment to this goal. Validate the familys ability to develop and implement a plan that will address the concerns and what supports are available to help. Emphasize family strengths, including having the family brainstorm on their strengths. Encourage open and honest discussions, and creativity in generating solutions. Manage expectations by predicting that discussions may become uncomfortable and get the families advice on how they can help when that occurs. Be transparent regarding DFCS role and responsibility, including non-negotiable issues related to child safety. However, emphasize how this aligns with the familys goal. NOTE: In the absence of consensus, DFCS must ensure that the non-negotiable issues related to child safety are included as a part of a safety plan and/or case plan.Domestic Violence/Intimate Partner Violence (DV/IPV) Cases involving DV/IPV can be complex and must be treated with appropriate care. The primary concern is the safety of the family team members. Adequate preparation is required with all participants to ensure that safety is not jeopardized. During the preparation interview, if DV/IPV issues are suspected or known, and the alleged maltreater is present proceed with care in the discussion of such issues so that family members safety is not jeopardized. Have a separate discussion at another time with the alleged victim to ensure that safety issues are addressed. A community partner with expertise in DV/IPV or a DV/IPV liaison, including an expert in batterers intervention, should be consulted and engaged for participation; and/or a co-facilitator with some specialized knowledge and skills may also be involved in the FTM. Explain to other professionals, such as attorneys, the reason for having separate FTMs, so that they understand what you are trying to accomplish, can assist the process and not interfere with it (see Forms and Tools: Intimate Partner Violence [Domestic Violence] Guidelines & Protocol). The SSCM/FTM Facilitator must address safety issues prior to the meeting by determining: Whether conflict is likely and/or if there is an existing Order of Protection and potential violation of the provisions. How the safety of the victim parent/child(ren), and other family team members will be assured. What the victim parent believes will ensure his/her safety and that of the child(ren). Having separate FTMs to allow the victim parent the ability to speak freely. When separate FTMs are held for safety reasons, they should be held on different days and at different locations.Sexual Abuse Careful thought and preparation is essential when dealing with sexual abuse to avoid traumatizing or re-traumatizing the child and family",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-19-case-management-section-193-solution-focused-family-team

Among other things, Bright from the Start oversees the licensing and monitoring of all center-based and home-based childcare facilities, including investigating complaints of childcare programs and reports of unlicensed childcare. Childcare providers must register with Bright from the Start if they provide childcare services for more than two non-related children or more than six related children. For more information on Bright from the Start, visit their website at http://decal.ga.gov/BftS/About.aspx. Childcare and Parent Services (CAPS) CAPS is administered by the Georgia Department of Early Care and Learning. The CAPS program supports early education goals by assisting low income families with the cost of child care while they work, go to school or training, or participate in other work-related activities. The purpose of CAPS is threefold: Provide access to high quality and affordable early learning environments for families who are considered low income. Support DECAL's efforts in increasing positive school readiness outcomes. Assist families in achieving and maintaining self-sufficiency by providing financial supports for child care costs. Rates must not exceed the amount that the provider charges other customers who do not receive subsidies. Some examples of different types of childcare are full-time, night-time, weekend, before/after school, full-day service for school-age and part-time Children eligible for CAPS must be a resident of Georgia both legally and physically. DECAL will only pay for childcare services provided within the state of Georgia. For exceptions (i.e., border agreements with surrounding states), please contact the Early Childhood Collaboration Unit at Early.childhood@dhs.ga.gov. Childcare Providers Childcare services may be purchased from formal or informal providers. Child safety and wellbeing should be the primary considerations when selecting a childcare provider. Formal Providers: The formal providers are regulated and licensed by DECAL. Below are the major categories of formal childcare providers: Family Child Care Learning Home: This is a program that operates in a private residential home less than 24 hours per day. The operator receives pay for providing care for three to six children under 13 years of age or 18 years of age if the child meets the criteria for CAPS special needs or court-ordered supervision. Child Care Learning Center: This is a program operated by an individual or business entity recognized under Georgia law that receives pay for group care. It cares for seven or more children under 18 years of age for less than 24 hours per day. Licensed-exempt Programs: Programs owned and operated by any department or agency of state, county or municipal government (i.e. afterschool programs in public schools operated by public school systems, and programs operated by city or county park and recreation departments); andDay camp programs for children five years of age and older operated between school terms, whose primary purpose is to provide organized recreational, religious or instructional activities.Informal Providers: Childcare services may be purchased from informal providers due to child safety concerns only in the following situations: No other licensed care is available within a reasonable geographic area; The need for care is during non-traditional hours when licensed care is not available; or The child in care is determined to meet the CAPS program definition of children with disabilities.Informal providers are not required to be licensed but must enroll with the CAPS program. Informal providers must be 21 years of age or older to receive payment through CAPS. Types of informal child care providers include the following:Relative Informal Child Care Arrangements include child care that is provided by a caregiver who is related to the child by blood, marriage, or adoption, such as an aunt, uncle, grandparent, great-grandparent, or adult sibling. The relative informal child care arrangement may take place at the relatives residence or in the childs residence. The relative must not be included in the family unit. If the relative cares for children for pay, the total number of children in care cannot exceed six. Of the children in child care, no more than two can be unrelated for pay. If the relative care is for more than six related children for pay (as described by Child Care Services licensing rules), they are required to obtain a license from DECAL. NOTE: Adult siblings that are informal providers must live in a separate residence from the eligible children receiving child care subsidies. For relative informal providers, a maximum of six children are allowed at the residence where care is provided. Non-relative Informal Child Care Arrangements include care with individuals who are not related to the child by blood, marriage, or adoption. The non-relative must provide care in his/her own residence and may not be a resident of the household of the children receiving care. If the non-relative cares for more than two unrelated children for pay, s/he is required to obtain a license from DECAL. NOTE: Parental Authorities or adults acting in loco parentis are unable to receive subsidy payment for their own children.CAPS Priority Cases The Childcare and Parent Services (CAPS) program uses an eligibility model based on priority groups. Priority groups may be widened, narrowed, added, or removed based on available funding. Applications submitted for initial eligibility will be denied if the family does not meet eligibility for a priority group, even if other eligibility requirements are met. Applicants who are denied for not being in a priority group can appeal that decision only if they believe the determination was made in error. See DECAL CAPS Policy Manual Policy 7: Priority Groups. Priority group status is only required at initial eligibility determination and is not required at annual redetermination. The following is a list of the priority groups (in alphabetical order): Child Protective Services (CPS) and court-ordered supervision cases Children in Georgia Division of Family and Children Services (DFCS) custody Families experiencing domestic violence Families of children with disabilitiesFamilies of children enrolled in the lottery-funded Georgias Pre-K Program Families participating in or transitioning from TANF Families who have experienced a natural disaster Families who lack fixed, regular, and adequate housing Families with very low income as defined by CAPS Grandparents Raising Grandchildren (GRG) Minor parents Need to protectEligibility for CAPS in CPS Cases Children in CPS cases may be eligible for CAPS, if they meet one of the following criteria. A child 12 years old or younger in an open CPS case lives in the home of the CPS parents/caregivers and the purpose of the childcare is to address safety threats due to a lack of supervision or childcare. The caregiver(s) must meet the CAPS non-financial eligibility requirements (Georgia residency, child citizenship or qualified alien status, immunization, and identity) as prescribed in DECAL CAPS Policy Manual Policy 6: Eligibility Requirements. The caregiver(s) must meet the CAPS income guidelines as prescribed in the CAPS Income Calculations Policy (DECAL CAPS Policy Manual Policy 8: Income Calculations).The state-approved activity requirement may be waived by DECAL while the CPS case is open and through the 12-month eligibility period. A child 12 years old or younger in an open CPS case moves to the home of a new resource caregiver(s) (i.e. relative, safety resource, kinship care (not in DFCS custody), fictive kin, family friend, etc.) due to a safety or supervision concern, and the purpose of childcare is to allow the new resource caregiver(s) to work, attend school or training. The new resource caregiver(s) must meet the CAPS non-financial eligibility requirements (Georgia residency, child citizenship or qualified alien status, immunization, and identity) as prescribed in CAPS Eligibility Requirements Policy (DECAL CAPS Policy Manual Policy 6: Eligibility Requirements). The new resource caregiver(s) must meet the CAPS income guidelines as prescribed in the CAPS Income Calculations Policy (DECAL CAPS Policy Manual Policy 8: Income Calculations). The state-approved activity requirement may be waived by DECAL while the CPS case is open and through the 12-month eligibility period. NOTE: When the child returns home, childcare services may continue provided that the childs parents/caregivers income does not exceed 85% of the state median income (SMI) guidelines. The SSCM must notify DECAL of the change; however, the parents/caregivers will not need to apply for CAPS, if they meet the income guidelines.A child 13 years old or older with a special need in an open CPS case who is the subject of a court order requiring supervision. The family must meet CAPS income and residency requirements, but not the work activity requirement. A family fee is assessed based on the familys income. Children under court ordered supervision may receive CAPS services until the end of the month in which the child turns 18 years old.Children who need to receive protective services but are not formally involved with CPS may qualify for the Need to Protect priority group as prescribed in DECAL CAPS Policy Manual Policy 7.15 Priority Groups: Need to Protect.Georgia Head Start and Early Head Start Programs DFCS is partnering with the Office of Head Start and local Head Start/Early Head Start agencies. Georgia Head Start and Early Head Start programs provide comprehensive early childhood and family development services to children from birth to five years of age. Early Head Start serves infants, toddlers (i.e. birth to under 3 years of age) and pregnant women and their families who have incomes below the federal poverty level. Head Start is a childfocused program and has the overall goal of increasing school readiness of young children from low-income families by enhancing their cognitive, social, and emotional development. Head Start programs provide a learning environment that supports children's growth in many areas, such as language, literacy and social and emotional development. Head Start agencies provide a range of individualized services in the areas of education and early childhood development; medical, dental and mental health; nutrition; parent involvement and family support. There are numerous organizations, including school systems, community action agencies and universities that operate Head Start and Early Head Start programs in Georgia. All Head Start and Early Head Start programs must adhere to rigorous and comprehensive federal Program Performance Standards. To participate in Head Start and Early Head Start programs, families must meet the Head Start Family Income Eligibility Guidelines. However, children in foster care, homeless children, and children from families receiving public assistance (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families or Supplemental Security Income) are categorically eligible for Head Start and Early Head Start services regardless of income. Every effort should be made to enroll children who are four years of age or younger in a Head Start (3-4 years old) or Early Head Start (0-2 years old) program. If the Head Start program does not operate during the summer, children should be enrolled in a licensed childcare facility during the summer months. Using these resources helps to promote early brain development in children and prepare them for entry into kindergarten, promotes safety by ensuring the children are in the view of mandated reporters, and provides regular respite for foster parents. Questions or inquiries related to Early Head Start and Head Start programs should be directed to the DFCS Early Childhood Collaboration Unit within the Well-Being Services Section at the state office.Georgias Pre-K Programs Research confirms that students in Georgias Pre-K Program, a nationally recognized, lottery funded pre-kindergarten program continue to exhibit positive outcomes through the end of kindergarten across all domains of learning. Georgias Pre-K program is available in all 159 counties of the state. Children who are Georgia residents and are four years of age on September 1 of the current school year are eligible to attend Georgia's Pre-K Program during this school year. Pre-K programs usually operate on the regular school system calendar for the length of a typical school day. Pre-K Programs may be offered at local public schools or through private providers of preschool services. Every effort should be made to enroll children who are four years of age in Georgias Pre-K program. For additional information about eligibility and enrolling a child in Georgia's Pre-K Program please visit the Enrolling in Georgia's Pre-K Program webpage.FORMS AND TOOLSChildcare and Parent Services Policies and ProceduresChildcare and Parent Services (CAPS) Maximum Reimbursement RatesChildcare and Parent Services (CAPS) Published Provider Rate Form (CAPS Form 61)CAPS Referral - Georgia SHINES Job Aid",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-18-support-services-preserve-or-reunify-families-section-187

Imminent risk of placement or readiness for reunification of the children must be clearly documented in the case record. The PUP Program offers an array of support and intervention services. Through PUP, psychological or psychiatric assessments, substance abuse assessments, drug screens, and counseling services may be obtained from vendors who have the necessary skills and training to address the identified problems. PUP may also be used to help a family through a financial crisis with emergency rent, utilities or childcare. Families are encouraged to contribute to the costs of needed services. A family's own contribution, financially or in-kind, toward part of the required PUP expenditures is highly recommended, particularly in long term services such as childcare or counseling. This encourages and promotes a commitment on the part of the caregiver(s) to participate in the case plan toward goal achievement and self-sufficiency. PUP funds should not be used if other resources (i.e., community resources, private insurance or Medicaid) exist or until other resources have been exhausted.Risk of Imminent Placement Risk of imminent placement is defined as the likelihood of removal of children from their parent or caretaker and placement of the children into an emergency shelter or foster care placement within 14 days without intervention.Immediate Reunification A child must be in a foster care placement, including a kinship placement, and be ready for reunification with parents, kin, guardians or non-foster care placement within 60 days of initiating PUP services.Emergency Housing/Financial Assistance PUP funds may be authorized for temporary shelter, food, clothing and related services required by families with children to cope with a temporary crisis situation which poses an imminent threat to the safety of the children (i.e., fire, eviction, unsafe housing, separation for the safety of children and family members, etc.). It is important to assess how the crisis arose and how the family plans to manage going forward when considering the authorization of PUP funds for emergency financial assistance (i.e. rent and utility payments). If the family's crisis is because of some unavoidable emergency, PUP can be helpful. If the family's difficulties are chronic and reflect a lifestyle of crisis, PUP should not be used without a documented plan of how the family will manage once PUP is utilized. The case record must reflect how the family will resume responsibility for payment of rent and utilities after this one-time assistance. All financial assistance is through vendor payments.The emergency housing/financial assistance and temporary childcare components of the PUP Program are not to be used as a county general assistance fund. These funds are provided as one support service among others as a part of the safety or case plan in an open child welfare case. Past due rent, current rent and up to three months future rent can be paid once per family per fiscal year. Past utility bills, current utility bills and up to three months future utility bills may be paid once per family per fiscal year. Utility deposits may be paid once per fiscal year. When PUP funds are used to pay deposits for rent or utilities, the SSCM should include with the payment, a letter notifying the payee that the deposit should be returned to the County Department. Acceptance of this procedure by utility companies varies; however, SSCMs should still send the letter along with the payment. They should also notify the parent/caregiver that any deposits will need to be reimbursed to DFCS. Minor home repairs, directly related to the risk of maltreatment, may be authorized. Repairs on rental property that are the responsibility of the property owner, landlord, and/or property Management Company are NOT allowable expenses under PUP.Legal Fees for Guardianship of a Child Minor legal services or nominal legal fees may be paid with PUP funds, if it is directly related to risk of placement or immediate reunification efforts. Emergency Furniture PUP funds can be used to purchase emergency furniture after all other community resources have been exhausted. All emergency furniture assistance must be paid to the vendor only. Examples of emergency furniture include mattresses, cribs, and major appliances, etc. to maintain or reunify children back in a stable home. Prior authorization from the supervisor is needed before using this service.Emergency Clothing PUP funds can be used to purchase emergency clothing after all other community resources have been exhausted.Temporary Childcare Services Temporary childcare services may be purchased for families when the unassisted, daily care of children by their family presents an unacceptable risk of continued maltreatment and/or placement. Types of temporary childcare include: Group Day Care (State licensed, center-based day care for seven to eighteen children). Family Day Care (State registered, approved family home day care for up to six children). Day Care Center services (State licensed, center-based day care for nineteen or more children).Childcare is often an ongoing need and PUP's time-limited services cannot meet this ongoing need. The safety or case plan should indicate how the family will assume the responsibility for the ongoing expense of day care. Childcare is for children under the age of 13, or under the age of 18, if there is a physical or mental disability. Childcare services are provided away from their own home for less than 24 hours per day. The exception to this is payment of emergency 24-hour childcare with an approved resource when a caretaker is hospitalized and has no other resources to meet this need. The childcare services must correct or prevent a situation that would lead to an out-of-home placement of one or more children. Other support services such as Childcare and Parent Services (CAPS) should be accessed before approving PUP for temporary childcare. There is a maximum of six months of childcare services provided to each child per family per fiscal year.Counseling Counseling may be authorized for families when the provision of counseling services will help the family or individuals within the family resolve issues that contribute to the risk of maltreatment and out-of-home placement. Types of counseling services that may be utilized include, but are not limited to the following: Individual ChildGroup Family Substance Abuse Marital CounselingDomestic Violence Anger/Stress Management Grief & Separation Management Behavior Management Trauma Focused TherapyCounseling services through PUP are provided primarily to help with the effects of maltreatment and to strengthen the familys ability to resolve their problems through effective decision-making and coping skills. The counselor shall adhere to the professional code of ethics regarding responsibility to clients, integrity, and confidentiality, responsibility to colleagues, assessment instruments, research, advertising, and professional representation. Services must be provided by an approved contracted provider. Authorizing payment for Individual ongoing counseling for a sexual abuse offender is prohibited. The cost of ongoing counseling for a sexual abuse offender is the offender's responsibility. PUP may be used to pay for the ongoing counseling of a sexual abuse offender, when the offender is a minor in the household, as a part of the reunification plan, and when such services will prevent the removal of other children from the home. All other resources to pay for treatment and counseling for the juvenile sex offender should be explored prior to use of PUP. Medicaid and private insurance should be used before the use of PUP funds.Behavioral Health Assessment Guide This guide is to serve as a minimum standard reference for mental health/behavioral health assessments.

PSSF Family Support services promote healthy development by helping caregivers to enhance their strengths and resolve problems that can lead to child maltreatment, developmental delays, and family disruption. All services are designed to build on existing family strengths, increase the stability of families, increase caregiver confidence and competence, increase protective capacities, enhance overall family functioning to prevent initial or repeat child abuse and neglect while ensuring child safety, and to maintain the ability of foster families to provide for the well-being of children in their care. PSSF Family Support services are provided to families who are at risk for CPS involvement to reduce risk and prevent child maltreatment and for the support and retention of foster families. This includes families: Target Population Not known to the child welfare agency Who have been the subject of a report of suspected child abuse or neglect who: Were assigned to Family Support Were screened out or were the subject of an unsubstantiated investigation Have prior CPS history (closed but referred for follow-up supports/services) Foster Families Categories of services: FSS  Prevention and Early Intervention Services (PEI) FSS  Home Visitation Services (HVS) PSSF Healthy Relationship & Co-Parenting Services (HMI) PSSF Supports & Services for Homeless Youth (SHY) Service Duration: Duration is dependent on criteria established by proposed evidence-based strategy, practice or program model. PSSF Family Preservation services are provided to families that have or have had DFCS involvement because of child abuse or neglect, child or parent behavioral challenges, or serious parent-child conflict. Provision of these services grows out of the recognition that the unnecessary separation of children from their families is traumatic, often leaving lasting negative effects. Families at-risk or in-crisis can be preserved and children safely maintained in their homes when families receive intensive support and therapeutic services to improve family functioning and stability. Services are family focused and are designed to maintain children safely in their homes, prevent the unnecessary separation of families, and are offered as a safe alternative to out-of-home placement. PSSF Family Preservation services may also be provided to support families post-reunification to help prevent placement disruption.Providers of PSSF Family Preservation services are required to coordinate services with DFCS and other agencies including mental health, substance abuse, education, child care, and employment services to provide families a comprehensive continuum of community-based supports, interventions and follow-up services responsive to individual and family needs. Services may be offered to families referred by DFCS, juvenile or family court, who are in crisis or at-risk of having a child removed from their home. PSSF Family Preservation services are provided to families to prevent removal of children from their homes, stabilize placement and/ or to prevent re-entry into foster care.Target population Families who have or have had a substantiated investigation and/or a Family Preservation case to prevent repeat maltreatment and help these families maintain children in their homes safely. Relative caregivers who are caring for children when their parents are unable to do so to support the safety, permanency and well-being of these children. Foster parents and/or children in foster care to stabilize the placement and prevent disruption.Families for whom reunification is the goal, to prepare for and sustain reunification. Families whose children have returned home from foster care to prevent repeat maltreatment and sustain permanency.Children from families who have or have had a substantiated investigation and/or a Family Preservation case or are returning from foster care to improve educational outcomes. Service Delivery Expectations: Services are short-term, intensive interventions to mitigate parent or child behaviors to prevent escalation of circumstances to the point of requiring removal of children from the home. Based on reasons for referral, service objectives identified at referral, or needs identified in a family assessment, service plan must be solution-based in addressing the needs of the target population to achieve the desired outcomes. Assessment and Development of an Individual Service Plan: Families referred for services may have already undergone a comprehensive family assessment. Based on the results of that assessment, and the reason for referral, service objectives should be identified and an individualized service plan developed to meet the unique needs of the target population. If one is not available, or has not been conducted within the past 12 months, an assessment must be completed prior to or at the commencement of services utilizing a recognized assessment instrument effective in evaluating the strengths and needs of the identified target population to facilitate the development of an individualized service plan that addresses the circumstances that resulted in the referral and is responsive to the needs, goals and priorities of the family. Categories of services: PSSF Placement Prevention Services (PPS) PSSF Relative Caregiver/Kinship Family Services (RCS) PSSF Crisis Intervention & Placement Stabilization Services (CIS) PSSF Residential /Post Placement After-Care Services (RAC)PSSF Substance Abuse Treatment and Recovery Support Services (STR) PSSF Educational Support Services (ESS)PSSF Family Reunification Services are provided to ensure the strength and stability of family reunification. Services are provided when a youth or child has been removed from the care of their parents and for the 15-month period that begins on the date that the child returns home. Reunification is the most common goal for children and youth in out-of-home care as well as the most common outcome. While reunification is generally thought of as reuniting the children and youth in foster care with their families and reinstating custody to their parents or guardians, a broader definition that includes living with other relatives is sometimes used. The physical return of the child or youth to parents or caretakers may occur before the return of legal custody, as when the child welfare agency continues to supervise the family for some period of time. Reunification is considered achieved when both care and custody are returned to parents or guardians, and the child or youth is discharged from the child welfare system. The challenge for child welfare agencies is to achieve reunifications that are both timely and do not result in re-entry. Safe and timely family reunification is the preferred permanency planning option for all children in Georgia state custody unless it is not in the best interests of the child. PSSF Family Reunification Services help to support positive consistent family relationships and prevent multiple re-entries into foster care. Family-centered values and practice, along with evidence-based practices, are the foundation of safe, timely reunification/permanency. Efforts to assure safe and permanent reunifications for children are complicated because of the strict time frames set forth in the Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) of 1997 and the complex and interrelated problems many families experience, such as substance abuse, domestic violence and mental illness. The degree to which families effectively maintain reunification is largely dependent upon the ability to connect families with timely, intensive and responsive supports and services during the time a child is in foster care and the first 15 months when a child returns home post-reunification. Since the majority of children who leave foster care are reunified with their families, it is important to focus on practices that help achieve successful reunification. PSSF Family reunification services are intensive support services provided to a child to promote safe, appropriate, and effective reunification with their primary caregiver and provided to children during the15-month period that begins on the date that the child returns home. PSSF Family Reunification Services are provided to families to reduce the time in foster care, facilitate reunification, and sustain permanency for children, pre- or post- return of children to families from foster care or residential treatment. PSSF Family Reunification Services are provided to families whose children have a plan of reunification or an alternative concurrent permanency option. Target Population Families with children in foster careFamilies with court-ordered relative placementFamilies with children who have returned home from foster care for the first 15 months of the return home.Service Duration: During the time the child is in foster care and within the 15-month period that begins on the date the child returns home. PSSF Family Reunification Services includes the following categories of services: Child and Family Advocacy (CFA) Supervised Family Visitation Services (SFV)PSSF Adoption Promotion and Permanency Support (APS) Categories of services: Adoption Promotion and Post-Permanency Services (APS): services are designed to encourage and support permanency for children through adoption, when adoption is in the best interest of the child or to facilitate permanency for children through relative guardianship and to prevent disruption or dissolution of those relationships. It is common for adoptive families to need support and services to prepare for and sustain adoption. Transition periods can be especially difficult for families who must also address child welfare-related issues such as separation and loss. Families who adopt children with special needs also face additional challenges that may be compounded by the childs past experiences of child abuse and neglect. Transition and Emancipation Support Services: Services are designed to help youth develop skills for independent living and establish meaningful adult connections while simultaneously working toward achieving permanency through reunification, adoption, or guardianship. Youth who are nearing the age of emancipation without an identified permanency resource may need additional supports and services to help transition and prepare for the opportunities and challenges of independent adult living. Without family supports and community networks to help them make successful transitions to adulthood, these young adults may experience very poor outcomes at a much higher rate than the general Target Populations: Post Permanency Support Foster/adoptive children and youth, particularly those with special needs Foster, pre-adoptive and adoptive parents Relative caregivers Transition and Emancipation Support Youth age 16+ preparing for emancipation from foster care Youth age 18+, who have signed themselves back in for services Youth or young adults recently emancipated from foster care Service Duration: Adoption Promotion and Post-Permanency Services: 3-6 months pre-adoption or guardianship and up to 6-months post-adoption or guardianship.Transition and Emancipation Support Services: 6-9 months before exiting Foster Care and/or 6-9 months following emancipation, not to exceed 12 months Service Delivery Expectations: Adoption Promotion and Post-Permanency Services Services are designed to address issues related to separation and adjustment which may impair family functioning.Adequate support is particularly critical for special needs adoptions where challenges and adjustments faced by families can be immediate and intense. Post-permanency supports and services should help identify and address family issues which negatively impact family functioning and help stabilize and support families to prevent disruption. Post-permanency services are geared toward normalizing the adoption experience, helping adoptive parents increase parent-child attachment and decrease family isolation by creating opportunities to connect with others in similar circumstances.FORMS AND TOOLSPromotion Safe and Stable Families Program",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-18-support-services-preserve-or-reunify-families-section-182

The SSCM should carefully consider the ability of the parents to understand all discussions related to voluntary surrender. The SSCM should ensure the parent is seeking to surrender their rights free of coercion or manipulation from any other person. If the parent is a minor child in DFCS custody, their attorney must be present during the signing of the voluntary surrender of parental rights. If the SSCM is uncertain about the parents ability to make an informed decision, guidance should be sought from the Office of the General Counsel. A voluntary surrender of parental rights should not be taken if there is any doubt as to the competence of the parent. In this case, it will be necessary to go to court to terminate parental rights. If the parent wishes to express to the judge that he/she wants to voluntarily surrender parental rights, the judge could then incorporate this into a court order as the grounds for termination.Executing a Voluntary Surrender Careful attention must be given to using the correct forms for each parent (biological or legal) surrendering based on their relationship to the child. Using the incorrect form may invalidate the surrender. A voluntary surrender of parental rights that is not properly executed cannot be corrected by Juvenile Court. The court cannot determine rights were terminated based on the voluntary surrender of parental rights if the documents were incorrectly executed. Adoption (Private Agency) Adoption of a child through a child placing agency (CPA) licensed by the State of Georgia to place children for adoption or through the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children from a licensed CPA in another state.Biological Father A male who impregnated the biological mother resulting in the birth of the child.

United States Code, if the offense had occurred in the special maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the United States) or murder in the second degree of another child of the parent; Voluntary manslaughter (which would have been an offense under section 1112(a) of Title 18, United States Code, if the offense had occurred in the special maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the United States) of another child of the parent;Voluntary manslaughter of the other parent of the child;Aiding or abetting, attempting, conspiring or soliciting to commit murder or voluntary manslaughter of another child of the parent; Aiding or abetting, attempting, conspiring, or soliciting to commit murder or voluntary manslaughter of the other parent of the child; or A felony assault that results in serious bodily injury to the child or another child of the parent. When the parent or legal guardian has committed sexual abuse against the surviving child or another child of the parent; or When the parent or legal guardian is required to register with a sex offender registry under section 113 (a) of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006.At its discretion, may elect not to file or join a petition to terminate the parental rights of a parent if: At the option of DFCS, the child is being cared for by a relative; DFCS has documented in the case plan (which must be available for court review) a compelling reason for determining that filing such a petition would not be in the best interest of the individual child; or DFCS has not provided to the family, consistent with the time period in the case plan, services that DFCS deems necessary for the safe return of the child to the home, when reasonable efforts to reunify the child are required.Concurrently begin to identify, recruit, process and approve a qualified adoptive family for the child, when DFCS files or joins a petition to terminate parental rights. Ensure the DFCS County Director/Designee approve and confirm in writing the decision to file TPR based on: The circumstances of the case; Documentation of evidence; and The goal of adoption being a viable permanent plan. Use any of the following grounds outlined in state law, when filing a petition for TPR: The parent has given written consent to termination which has been acknowledged by the court or has voluntarily surrendered his or her child to DFCS for adoption; The parent has subjected his/her child to aggravated circumstances; The parent has wantonly and willfully failed to comply with court-ordered support for a period of 12 months or longer; The parent has abandoned the child; A child is a dependent child due to lack of proper parental care or control by his or her parent, reasonable efforts to remedy the circumstances have been unsuccessful or were not required, such dependency is likely to continue or will likely not be remedied in the reasonably foreseeable future, and: Returning the child to the parent is likely to cause serious physical, mental, moral, or emotional harm to the child or threaten the physical safety or wellbeing of the child; or Continuation of the parent-child relationship will cause or is likely to cause serious physical, mental, moral, or emotional harm to the child. Refrain from accepting a parent's surrender of their rights to the child once a TPR petition has been filed unless the parent: Consents to a judgment terminating his/her parental rights; and  Executes an act of surrender in favor of: A third party, if all the parties to the petition to terminate parental rights agree; or DFCS. Ensure the court appoints an attorney to represent the child in a TPR proceeding. The court may also appoint this person as the Guardian ad Litem (GAL) or shall appoint a separate GAL.  Prepare for, attend, and participate in TPR hearings. Make efforts to permanently place the child with kin following a TPR order if the individual is willing and found by the court to be qualified to receive and care for the child. Acknowledge that the parent(s) have 30 days from the day the termination order is filed in which to appeal. NOTE: The person appealing a TPR decision must seek a discretionary appeal as there is no longer an appeal right in TPR cases. The decision to terminate parental rights stands if an application for a discretionary appeal is not filed within 30 days after the termination order (order is signed by the judge and filed with the clerk of court) or a notice of appeal is not filed within ten days after the appellate court enters an order permitting the appeal. If the application for appeal is granted and the Notice of Appeal is filed timely, the juvenile court order stands until the appeal is resolved. The County Department continues with the legal right to the care and control of the child.Acknowledge that a child may petition the court to reinstate parental rights if: He/she has not been adopted after three years from the TPR date or date of voluntary surrenders; and The court has determined the permanency plan is no longer adoption. NOTE: The petition may be filed prior to the three-year timeframe if the child and DFCS or licensed child-placing agency (with custody of the child) stipulates that the child is no longer likely to be adopted. A child 14 years of age or older shall sign the petition unless there is good cause why they should not.PROCEDURESThe Social Services Case Manager (SSCM) will: Monitor alerts and the Case Watch page in Georgia SHINES to ensure the TPR is filed timely or a compelling reason for not filing is documented. Review the case record to ensure all relevant information is documented to support the filing including: All contacts (telephone, email, written correspondence and face-to-face contacts) with the parent(s), child, placement resource, kin, service providers and other collaterals; Parent-child visitation; When visits were scheduled; Whether or not the visits occurred, where they occurred and the duration of the visits; Why visits did not occur and efforts to resolve barriers to visitation; The quality and quantity of interaction between the parent and child during visitation; The degree of understanding and acceptance shown by the parent toward the child and the childs reaction to the parent; and The placement providers description of the childs behavior after parent-child visits. Referrals for services; Dates and reasons for the referral; Participation by the parent(s) in services; Missed appointments and the reasons for missed appointments; Follow-up contact with the service providers; Recommendations of the service providers; Progress made by the parent(s) including behavioral changes observed. All efforts made to fulfill the case plan requirements and/or engage parents who are not complying with the case plan, including any diligent search efforts to locate an absent parent (see policy 19.20 Case Management: Diligent Search).Determine, in collaboration with the Social Services Supervisor (SSS), if TPR is in the best interest of the child and the timeframe for filing the petition for TPR or documenting the compelling reasons for not filing the petition; NOTE: Consider the 15 out of 22 months as the maximum length of time a child can be in foster care before mandated termination action takes place unless a compelling reason for an exception to filing for TPR is documented in the case plan.Conduct a Family Team Meeting (FTM) or other family meeting (see policy 19.3 Case Management: Solution-Focused Family Team Meetings) to: Discuss the decision to file a TPR petition and provide formal notification; Plan for permanency for the child; and Inform the child and family about the process for reinstatement of parental rights if TPR is granted). Document in the Case Plan in Georgia SHINES, the specific reason for not filing the TPR if the decision is not to file a TPR based on any of the following: The child is placed with a relative: Where the child is placed;Length of time in the home; Adjustment of the child to the placement; Stability of the placement; Fitness and capability of the relative; Safety and quality of care the child receives; Commitment of the relative to the child (present and future);Potential for permanency through adoption or guardianship. NOTE: Placing the child with a relative does not preclude consideration of permanency through adoption or guardianship (see policy 10.22 Foster Care: Permanency Planning). The compelling reason(s) for determining that filing the TPR petition is not in the best interest of the child (see Practice Guidance: Exceptions to Filing for TPR). Failure to provide services to facilitate reunification: The specific reunification services not provided, but considered necessary for the childs safe return; The reason such services are delayed or have not been provided within the time frames outlined in the case plan; Steps to remedy the failure to provide services; If services are provided the likelihood, it will bring about safe reunification within a specified time (indicate that time frame). Check the Putative Father Registry to identify any possible biological fathers, who are not the legal father of the child, if not previously completed (see policy 11.2 Adoption: Putative Father Registry and Birth Certificates). Prepare the Termination Packet: The information provided in the Termination Packet should allow the Special Assistant Attorney General (SAAG) to determine if: The evidence will satisfy the grounds for TPR; andAll requisite steps have been fulfilled to prepare the TPR petition. Submit the TPR Packet to the SSS for review and approval. Submit the TPR Packet to the SAAG within 30 days of written approval from the County Director/Designee. Staff with the SAAG to prepare for the TPR hearing, by reviewing: The evidence Chronology of case events  Major points to be brought out in testimonyWitnessesAny other informationProvide notification to the caregiver (placement resource) in accordance with policy 17.8 Legal: Caregivers Right to be Notified and Heard and document in the narrative of the Contact Detail page in Georgia SHINES within 72 hours of the occurrence, including:  Efforts to contact him/her The date and method in which notification was provided The response to the notification Whether he/she plans to attend the hearing and if not, why not Explanation of the importance of attending the hearing and the possibility of being subpoenaed (see Practice Guidance: Caregiver Testimony Dispositional Phase of TPR) Whether he/she will present verbal or written testimony and/or documentation and if not, why not Attend the TPR hearing and be prepared to testify. Notify the Adoption Exchange, State Adoption Unit within twenty-four hours of a TPR of a child that fits the description of a Wait List child (see policy 11.4 Adoption: Wait List); Update the Legal Action and Outcomes Detail page in Georgia SHINES; NOTE: The State Office Adoption Unit is notified in Georgia SHINES by a system generated alert once the Legal Action and Outcomes Detail page is updated. Obtain and review the TPR court order for accuracy and that it includes the required language and court-ordered recommendations (see policy 17.3 Legal: Court Orders and Placement Authority). Upload the court order to Georgia SHINES External Documentation. Proceed with finalizing the permanency plan of adoption if TPR is granted and the parent(s) do not file an appeal within the required time frame (see policy 11.1 Adoption: Adoption Preparation). When TPR is granted, and the parent(s) file an appeal: Offer brief supportive services to the parent(s); Provide a list of community agencies that may be able to support the family during the appeal process;  Continue parent-child visitation when in the best interest of the child unless the court order states otherwise;  Engage the family in adoption planning (see policy 11.1 Adoption: Adoption Preparation). If a child requests to have parental rights reinstated: Explore the reinstatement with the child, GAL, placement resource and the childs support team, including: Whether the request meets the provision of the law for reinstatement of parental rights; The childs reason for wanting reinstatement; Other permanency options available to the child; Any contact between the child and parent(s) since TPR;The impact on the childs safety, permanency, and well-being if parental rights are reinstated or if the parent chooses not to reinstate his/her rights; The current protective capacities of the parent(s) and the current child vulnerabilities; and The childs expectations of what will occur if parental rights are reinstated. Inform the child his/her GAL will assist in filing a petition to reinstate parental rights; Complete a Kinship Assessment on the parent(s) (see policy 22.3 Kinship: Kinship Assessment);Participate in a staffing with the SSS and SAAG to determine DFCS recommendations regarding reinstatement; Attend and participate in any court hearings regarding reinstatement; Provide transition services to the child and family when ordered by the court if reinstatement is granted.The SSS will: Monitor the Georgia SHINES Case Watch page to ensure timely filing of TPR or a compelling reason for not filing is documented. Review the case record to determine whether: Reasonable efforts are being made to reunify the child and family or achieve an alternate permanency plan; Sufficient evidence exists to support TPR and the recommended permanency plan to be considered by the court. Conduct a supervisor staffing with the SSCM to determine whether TPR is in the best interest of the child (see Practice Guidance: Best Interests Determination). Review the TPR Packet for accuracy and completeness: If the TPR Packet is incomplete, return the packet to the SSCM indicating what information is required.  If the TPR Packet is complete, submit the packet to the County Director/Designee for review and approval. Participate in the staffing with the SSCM and SAAG prior to a TPR hearing. Provide guidance to the SSCM on how to prepare and testify at the hearing. Attend court hearings to provide guidance and support to the SSCM, as needed. Review the TPR court order for accuracy and that it includes the required language and court-ordered recommendations (see policy 17.3 Legal: Court Orders and Placement Authority). Ensure documentation is entered, court orders are uploaded, and the appropriate pages updated in Georgia Shines within 72 hours of the occurrence. Monitor appeal timeframes to ensure: Timely achievement of the permanency plan if no appeal is filed; Ongoing follow-up with the SAAG, if an appeal is filed. Support the SSCM to ensure brief supportive services and continued visitation (when determined in the best interest of the child and not prohibited by court order) are provided to the parents, if the TPR is under appeal. NOTE: If services to facilitate reunification were not provided, notify the County Director and Regional Director in writing. Conduct a staffing with the SSCM to determine that it meets the provisions of the law and DFCS recommendation if a child wishes to petition the court to reinstate parental rights.The County Director/Designee will: Review the TPR Packet. Make an approval determinationPRACTICE GUIDANCETermination of parental rights is the most serious legal action DFCS can take regarding the parent/child relationship. A TPR order is without limit as to duration. Once issued and not overturned by appeal, the order is permanent. If the court commits the child to the permanent custody of DHS, the County Department has all rights and responsibilities of the legal custodian, including the authority to consent to: Marriage Enlistment in the Armed Services Any surgical procedure or other medical treatment for the child AdoptionWhen a mothers parental rights have been terminated (voluntary or involuntary), she no longer has the right or authority to sign an acknowledgement of paternity form or to consent to the granting of a petition of legitimation for the same child. When parental rights are terminated, there is the expectation that the child will achieve permanency through adoption. To make sure that agency efforts are directed toward achieving this outcome, both federal and state law require certain status reports, hearings, and case plan documentation as a way to provide judicial oversight of agency efforts to place the child in an adoptive home (see policy 17.2 Legal: Case Review/Permanency Plan Hearings and 17.1 Legal: The Juvenile Court Process).Abandonment Abandonment or abandoned means any conduct on the part of a parent, guardian or legal custodian showing an intent to forgo parental duties or relinquish parental claims. Intent to forgo parental duties or relinquish parental claims may be evidenced by: Failure, for a period of at least six months, to communicate meaningfully with a child; Failure, for a period of at least six months, to maintain regular visitation with a child; Leaving a child with another person without provision for his/her support for a period of at least six months; Failure, for a period of at least six months, to participate in any court ordered plan or program designed to reunite a childs parent, guardian, or legal custodian with his/her child; Leaving a child without affording any means of identifying such child or his or her parent, guardian, or legal custodian and: The identity of such childs parent, guardian or legal custodian cannot be ascertained despite diligent searching; and A parent, guardian or legal custodian has not come forward to claim such child within three months following the finding of the child. Being absent from the home of his/her child for a period of time that creates a substantial risk of serious harm to a child left in the home; Failure to respond, for a period of at least six months, to notice of child protective proceedings; or Any other conduct indicating intent to forgo parental duties or relinquish parental claims. Written Confirmation by the County Director/Designee Confirmation in writing may include the County Directors/Designees signature on a staffing form where the decision to file TPR is made; signature on the Legal Services Request to file TPR; or documentation by the County Director/Designee in the narrative of Contact Detail in Georgia SHINES.Exceptions to Filing for TPR The County Department must continue to develop and re-evaluate the childs permanency plan and follow permanency hearing requirements despite documenting a compelling reason for not filing TPR. Examples of compelling reasons for not filing TPR should be case specific and may include: A parent of the child is successfully participating in services that will make it possible for the child to safely return home; Another permanency plan is better suited to meet the health and safety needs of the child. The following situations are examples of when an alternative permanency plan may be in the childs best interest: The child is 14 years of age or older and objects to the TPR; NOTE: Prior to accepting a childs objection, the court shall personally question the child in chambers to determine whether the objection is a voluntary and knowledgeable choice. The child is 16 years of age or older and requests that emancipation be selected as the permanency plan; The parent and child have a significant bond, but the parent is unable to care for the child because of an emotional or physical disability and the childs caregiver has committed to raising the child to adulthood and facilitating visits with the parent; The child is in a residential treatment facility that provides services designed to address the childs treatment needs and the court determines the childs needs could not be served in a less restrictive environment. The child is living with a relative who is unable or unwilling to adopt, but who is willing and capable of providing the child with a stable and permanent home environment and the removal from this relative would be detrimental to the childs emotional well-being; The court or Judicial Citizen Review Panel (JCRP), in a prior hearing or review, determined that DFCS did not make reasonable efforts to reunify the family; The child is an unaccompanied refugee or there are international legal obligations or foreign policy reasons that would preclude TPR.If a child is alleged or adjudicated to have committed a delinquent act and is also in foster care, the following would be additional compelling reasons for not filing for TPR: The childs developmental needs require continued out-of-home placement for an additional number of months and his parent, guardian or legal custodian has cooperated with referrals, visitation, family conferences and therapy; A child is uncooperative with services or referrals; and The length of the delinquency disposition affects the permanency plan. If reunification cannot occur within the time frame specified in the case plan, but it is not appropriate to abandon it as the permanency plan, reunification efforts may continue within a reasonable extension of time which is consistent with the childs developmental needs. The reasons why the continuation is needed, and a projected reunification date should be clearly documented.Termination Packet The Termination Packet is designed to expedite the process of moving children to permanency. While the SAAG may request additional documents and/or case information, the Termination Packet should be completed with attachments as listed in each section, including, but not limited to: Copies of any legitimation and/or adoption orders; Copies of the executed voluntary surrender documents when a parent has voluntarily surrendered their rights to DFCS; All case plans for the prior 18 months; A copy of the birth certificate for each child; 5. Any additional information which will assist the SAAG in completing a petition to TPR. The SAAG should prepare the termination petition and have it ready for verification and filing within 30 days of receipt of the completed Termination Packet. Any delays in receipt of the petition should be discussed with the SAAG. The DHS Office of General Counsel may need to be notified of repeated delays.Petitions for TPR A petition for TPR shall: Clearly state that an order for TPR is requested; State the statutory grounds on which the petition is based; Set forth: The facts that bring the child within the jurisdiction including a statement that it is in the best interests of the child and public that the proceedings be brought; The name, age, date of birth and residence address of the child; The name and residence address of the parent, guardian, or legal custodian or if the parent, guardian or legal custodian does not reside or cannot be found in the state, the name of any adult relative residing in the county or if none, the adult relative living closest to the court; Whether the child is in protective custody and if so, the place of his/her foster care and the time the child was taken into protective custody; and Whether any of the above information is unknown. When a petition for TPR seeks termination of the rights of a biological father who is not the legal father and who has not surrendered his rights to the child, the petition shall include a certificate from the putative father registry disclosing the name, address and social security number of any registrant acknowledging paternity of the child or the possibility of paternity of a child of the childs mother for a period beginning no more than two years immediately before the childs birth. The certificate shall document a search of the registry on or before the date the petition was filed and shall include a statement that the registry is current to the date of the filing of the petition.Seeking to be Joined as a Party to a Petition Consult with the SAAG regarding how DFCS becomes joined as a party to a petition for TPR which has already been filed by another party on the childs behalf. TPR Hearing TPR hearings should be conducted within 90 days of the date the TPR petition is filed unless the court determines that just cause for a delay is shown. A TPR proceeding shall be commenced in the county: That has jurisdiction over related dependency proceedings; In which the child legally resides; In which a child is present when the termination proceeding is commenced, if the child is present without his/her parent, guardian, or legal custodian; or Where the acts underlying the petition to terminate parental rights are alleged to have occurred.NOTE: For the convenience of the parties, the court may transfer proceedings to the county in which the parent of a child adjudicated as a dependent child legally resides. If a proceeding is transferred, certified copies of all legal and social documents and records pertaining to the proceeding on file with the clerk of court shall accompany the transfer. In all TPR proceedings, the standard of proof is by clear and convincing evidence. If no just cause for delay has been shown by written finding of fact by the court, an order of disposition shall be issued by the juvenile court no later than 30 days after the conclusion of the hearing on the TPR petition. Once TPR has been ordered, the parent whose rights have been terminated is not entitled to be notified of any adoption proceeding or have the right to object to any adoption. The relationship between a child and his/her siblings shall not be severed until a final order of adoption. Despite TPR, a relatives relationship for the purpose of placement and permanency remains intact until terminated by a final order of adoption.Caregiver Participation in Hearings The juvenile court is required to make specific findings of fact in its court order related to the caregivers notice, attendance, testimony, or documentary evidence. Such findings of fact shall include: Whether the caregiver was provided notice of the hearing or review, including the method, and whether the caregiver expressed an interest in being heard at the hearing or review; and  If the caregiver is present at the hearing, specific information regarding the caregivers views, including, but not limited to those concerning the childs: well-being, health, and safety; Any changes the caregiver believes are necessary to advance the childs wellbeing, health and safety; The timeliness, necessity, and quality of services being provided to the child and caregiver; and a summary of the documentation presented by the caregiver regarding the childs well-being, health, safety, including, but not limited to reports from physicians, counselors, psychologists, and teachers.Evidence Standard and Best Interest in TPR Cases DFCS evidence must support its petition for TPR. The burden of proof is on DFCS to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the child is dependent and grounds for TPR exist. In considering TPR, the following factors are considered by the court: Standard of Evidence - There must be clear and convincing evidence of parental misconduct or inability to care for the child; and Best Interest of the Child - If the standard of evidence can be satisfied, then the court must determine that termination is in the best interest of the child. In determining whether the child is without proper parental care and control, the court shall consider, without being limited to, the following:A medically verifiable deficiency of the parents physical, mental, or emotional health of such duration or nature as to render the parent unable to provide adequately for the child; Excessive use of or history of chronic, un-rehabilitated substance abuse with the effect of rendering the parent incapable of providing adequately for the physical, mental, emotional, or moral conditions and needs of the child; Conviction of the parent of a felony and imprisonment, which has a demonstrable negative effect on the quality of the parent-child relationship; Egregious conduct or evidence of past egregious conduct of the parent toward the child or another child of a physically, emotionally, or sexually cruel or abusive nature; Physical, mental, or emotional neglect of the child or evidence of past physical, mental or emotional neglect of the child or of another child by the parent; and Serious bodily injury or death of a sibling under circumstances which constitute substantial evidence that such injury or death resulted from parental neglect or abuse. NOTE: A parents reliance on prayer or other religious non-medical means for healing instead of medical care in the exercise of religious beliefs, shall not be the sole basis for determining a parent to be unwilling or unable to provide safety and care adequate to meet his/her childs physical, emotional, and mental health needs.In addition to the above considerations that a child is without proper parental care or control, the court shall consider, without being limited to, whether the parent, without justifiable cause, has failed significantly for a period of six months or longer prior to the filing of the petition for TPR to: Develop and maintain a parental bond with the child in a meaningful, supportive manner. Provide for the care and support of the child as required by law or judicial decree; and  Comply with a court-ordered case plan designed to reunite the child with the parent(s).TPR shall be ordered when the court finds: Any ground for TPR is proven by clear and convincing evidence; and TPR is in a childs best interest.Best Interests Determination in TPR Cases If any of the statutory grounds for TPR has been met, the court shall then consider whether TPR is in the childs best interest after considering the following: The childs sense of attachments including his/her sense of security and familiarity, and the continuity of affection for the child; The childs wishes and long-term goals; The childs need for permanence including his/her need for stability and conti",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-17-legal-section-1711-termination-parental-rights-tpr
GA :: Child Welfare Policy Manual :: Chapter 17 Legal :: Section 17.11 Termination Of Parental Rights (TPR),Georgia,Rules,"2023, 2022","Administrative process, Termination of parental rights",,,"Key Considerations for Termination Proceedings:

Best Interest Determination: The court evaluates several factors to determine the best interests of the child, including the continuity of relationships, the benefit of integrating into a stable home, the effects of a lack of stability, and the child's overall future well-being.
Aggravated Circumstances: If a parent has committed severe offenses such as the murder of the other parent, the court shall presume that TPR is in the child's best interests.
Custody After Termination or Surrender of Parental Rights:

Post-TPR Placement: Post-termination, the court assesses the best placement for the child, considering the childs need for legal permanence, the least disruptive placement, and the value of biological connections.
Evidence Consideration: The court may consider any relevant and necessary evidence, including hearsay, to determine the best permanency and custody arrangements.
Caregiver Testimony in Dispositional Phase of TPR:

Involvement of Caregivers: Post-TPR, the testimony of caregivers who have hosted the child for at least 12 months is considered. This includes their insights on the childs attachment, health, and safety.
Appeal Process:

Notice of Appeal: TPR decisions can be appealed to higher courts, which review the initial courts findings without new testimony. The appellate process stays any related adoption proceedings until it concludes.
Outcome of Appeals: If the appellate court overturns a termination decision, it will direct who should have custody, potentially superseding temporary orders.
Reinstatement of Parental Rights:

Consideration for Reinstatement: If a child or parent seeks to reinstate parental rights, the court evaluates whether the parent has become capable of providing proper care. This includes a hearing and notices to all relevant parties.
Criteria for Reinstatement: The court may reinstate rights if it finds that the child is unlikely to be adopted and that reinstatement is in the childs best interests. Factors include parental fitness, the childs preferences, and any risks to the childs safety.
Forms and Tools:

Termination Packet: Includes various legal documents and affidavits to support the termination and subsequent proceedings.

This protocol is designed to promote cooperation and coordination in working together around the needs of dependent children. The role of a CASA in juvenile court dependency proceedings shall be to advocate for the best interests of the child. Before executing duties as a CASA and upon completion of all the requirements of an affiliate court appointed special advocate program, a CASA shall be sworn in by a judge of the Juvenile Court in the court or circuit in which he/she wishes to serve. A CASA shall not be assigned a case prior to being sworn in. The court may discharge a CASA when:The CASA acted in a manner contrary to the childs best interests; The CASA has not appropriately participated in the case; The court deems continued service as inappropriate or unnecessary; or The CASA has acted in a manner contrary to the mission and purpose of the affiliate court appointed special advocate program.NOTE: The Department of Human Services (DHS) Personnel Policy Manual prohibits DFCS employees from serving on the Board of Directors of any agency that receives funds under a contract with the state. This prohibition applies to local CASA programs since the state organization has a contract with DHS. However, DFCS staff may serve in an advisory capacity of liaison to the Boards and Advisory Boards should there be such a position. The liaison will not be a voting Board member.Attorneys and Guardians Ad Litem (GAL) In any dependency proceeding, the court may appoint a GAL for a child who is a party to the proceeding if the child has no parent, guardian, or custodian appearing on the childs behalf or if the interests of the parent, guardian or custodian conflict with the childs interests, or in any other case in which the interest of a child requires a guardian. In dependency cases, an attorney or CASA or both, may be appointed as the childs GAL. GALs who are not CASAs appointed as GALs do not have the same access to DFCS records as CASAs appointed as GALs. Thus, SSCMs should contact their SAAG when a non-CASA GAL requests access to records. An attorney for an alleged dependent child may serve as a childs GAL unless or until there is conflict of interest between the attorneys duty to the child as the childs attorney and the attorneys opinion of the best interests of the child as GAL. A court shall appoint a CASA to act as GAL, whenever possible. To comply with CAPTA, SAAGs will request that a GAL be appointed for all children in foster care via a motion at the preliminary protective hearing or in the dependency petition. While the GAL and DFCS share common goals in the safety, permanency, and well-being of the child, their perspectives differ in that GAL is child focused while the DFCS focuses on the child and the family, simultaneously. Before appointment as a GAL, the individual shall have received training appropriate to the role as GAL which is administered or approved by the Office of the Child Advocate for the Protection of Children. For attorneys, pre-appointment GAL training shall be satisfied within the attorneys existing continuing legal education obligation and shall not require the attorney to complete additional training hours. The court may remove a GAL from a case when: The GAL acted in a manner contrary to the childs best interests. The GAL has not appropriately participated in the case. The court deems continued service as inappropriate or unnecessary.Best Interest Determination A CASA and/or GAL shall advocate for a childs best interests in the proceeding for which he/she was appointed. In determining a childs best interest, a CASA and/or GAL shall consider and evaluate all the factors affecting the best interests of a child based on a childs age and developmental needs. Such factors shall include:The physical safety and welfare of the child, including food, shelter, health and clothing; The mental and physical health of all individuals involved; Evidence of domestic violence in any current, past or considered home for the child; The childs background and ties including familial, cultural and religious;The childs sense of attachments, including his/her sense of security and familiarity, and continuity of affection for the child; The least disruptive placement alternative for the child; The childs wishes and long-term goals; The childs community ties including church, school and friends; The childs need for permanence, including the childs need for stability and continuity of relationships with his/her parent, siblings, other relatives; The uniqueness of every family and child; The risks to entering and being in substitute care; The preferences of the persons available to care for the child; andAny other factors considered by the GAL to be relevant and proper to its determination.Duties and Responsibilities of a CASA and/or GAL Unless a childs circumstances render the following duties and responsibilities unreasonable, a GAL, at a minimum, shall: Maintain regular and sufficient face-to-face contact with the child and, in a manner appropriate to the childs developmental level, meet with and interview the child prior to custody hearings, adjudication hearings, disposition hearings, judicial reviews and any other hearings scheduled; In a manner appropriate to the childs developmental level, ascertain the childs needs, circumstances and views;  Conduct an independent assessment to determine the facts and circumstances surrounding the case; Consult with the childs attorney, if appointed separately, regarding the issues in the proceeding; Communicate with health care, mental health and other professionals involved in the childs case; Review case study and educational, medical, psychological and other relevant reports relating to the child and the parents, guardians or legal custodians; Review all court related documents; Attend all court hearings and other proceedings to advocate for the childs best interests; Advocate for timely court hearings to obtain permanency for the child; Protect the cultural needs of the child; Contact the child prior to any proposed change in the childs placement and after changes in the placement;Request a judicial citizen review panel or judicial review of the case; Attend judicial citizen review panels concerning the child and if unable to attend, forward a letter to the panel outlining the childs status since the last citizen review panel and include an assessment of the DFCS permanency plan and treatment plans;Provide written reports to the courts and the parties on the childs best interests, including, but not limited to: Recommendations regarding placement; Updates on the childs adjustment to placement; DFCS and parents, guardians or legal custodians compliance with prior court orders and treatment plans; The childs degree of participation during visitations; and Any other recommendations based on the best interests of the child. When appropriate, encourage settlement and the use of alternative forms of dispute resolution and participate in such processes to the extent permitted; and Monitor compliance with the case plan and all court orders.The SSCMs responsibilities to the CASA and/or GAL are: To arrange for the CASA and/or GAL to interview the child and all parties having knowledge of the childs situation. To inform the foster parent or facility staff person that a CASA and/or GAL has been assigned to the child as soon as the identity of the CASA is known. To immediately inform the CASA and/or GAL of the childs change in placement or any other significant change which could impact the CASAs and/or GALs role or decisions. To share pertinent information regarding the child with the CASA and/or GAL in a timely manner; at a minimum, contacts between the CASA and/or GAL and DFCS need to occur monthly. To make the DFCS case record available for review in the DFCS office (after removing the names of reporters). Follow HIPAA policy regarding the release of third party PHI. To provide written notification for the CASA and/or GAL to attend and participate in case plan meetings and reviews. To provide copies of all current case plans. To share and discuss with each other case specific recommendations, written suggestions and findings that will be included in reports to be submitted to the court (reaching consensus is not required).It is in the best interest of children and their families that collaboration occurs between DFCS and CASAs and/or GALs throughout the life of the case. Discussing the child prior to court hearings helps to prevent disputes that may impede the court process.FORMS AND TOOLSAdministration for Children and Families, U.S. Department of Health and Human ServicesCourt Appointed State Advocates (CASA) For Children",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-17-legal-section-1710-court-appointed-special-advocate

DFCS must support the court process by providing written notification to the caregivers to ensure their attendance and to coordinate the attendance of the foster child when appropriate. It is best practice to follow-up verbally with the caregiver by telephone or a face-to-face visit to ensure their understanding. In situations, such as Preliminary Protective Hearings, reasonable notice is required. When notice is received by DFCS less than 72 hours prior to the hearing date, verbal notification must be provided to the caregiver. If a verbal notification is given, concerted efforts must be made to speak directly with the caregiver. Concerted efforts involve making more than one contact, if necessary, and can include the following: Calling the caregiver at all available contact numbers. Leaving a detailed voicemail message. Making a face-to-face visit. Attempting to contact them at varying times throughout the day.Caregivers Right to be Heard Caregivers (i.e. foster, adoptive, kin or guardian resources and other placement resources) have the right to be heard at hearings related to the children in their care. The caregivers right to be heard at court hearings does not provide them the right to be made a party to the case; individuals who are parties to the case have the right to request an appeal, right to an attorney, and the right to call and cross-examine witnesses. The SSCM must inform the caregiver that he or she may provide information to the court concerning the childs care and permanency plan. The SSCM must explain to the caregiver that the court is required to inquire about their view of the childs health, safety, well-being and service needs highlighting that this information may be provided to the court either through testimony or written documentation. The SSCM must consult with the SAAG to determine the method in which the caregiver will provide information to the court and the timeframe for submission. The juvenile court is required to make specific findings of fact in its court order related to the caregivers notice, attendance, testimony or documentary evidence. Such findings of fact shall include:Whether the caregiver was provided notice of the hearing or review, including the method, and whether the caregiver expressed an interest in being heard at the hearing or review; and If the caregiver is present specific information regarding the caregivers views, including, but not limited to concerning the childs: Wellbeing, health and safety; Any changes the caregiver believes are necessary to advance the childs wellbeing, health and safety; The timeliness, necessity, and quality of services being provided to the child and caregiver; and a summary of documentation presented by the caregiver regarding the childs wellbeing, health, safety, including, but not limited to reports from physicians, counselors, psychologists, and teachers.Juvenile Court Hearings DFCS must ensure caregivers understand the judicial process as it relates to hearings. The SSCM must discuss with the caregiver the type of hearing that is to occur and the purpose of the hearing. It is important to provide the caregiver with an overview of the hearing procedures and requirements of each respective hearing (see policy 17.1 Legal: The Juvenile Court Process).

The juvenile court has exclusive jurisdiction over a child who is alleged to be dependent. However, the juvenile court will not accept a dependency petition filed by one parent against another in a possible attempt to modify a custody award. Based upon the evidence at any hearing held with respect to a child, the court may enter an order: Accepting or rejecting any DFCS report; Ordering an additional evaluation; or Undertaking another review as deemed necessary and appropriate to determine the disposition in the childs best interests. The courts order: May incorporate all or part of the DFCS case plan; andShall include findings of fact which reflect the courts consideration of the oral and written testimony offered by all parties, as well as non-parties, who are required to be provided with notice and a right to be heard in any hearing to be held with respect to a child and DFCS.Court Approval for Removal Court approval for the removal of a child is considered the first judicial determination on behalf of the child. This determination or order is known by various names in the different counties across the state including, but not limited to: Authorization to place Authorization to pick up Preliminary Protective order Ex parte order Emergency order Pick-up orderDependencyA dependent child means a child who: Has been abused or neglected and is in need of protection of the court; Has been placed for care or adoption in violation of law; or Is without his parent, guardian, or legal custodian. NOTE: A parent, guardian or legal custodians reliance on prayer or other spiritual means for healing in lieu of medical care, in the exercise of religious beliefs, shall not be the sole basis for considering the child to be a dependent child; however, the religious rights of a parent, guardian or legal custodian shall not limit the childs access to medical care in a life-threatening situation or when the condition will result in a serious disability. The juvenile court has the authority to order medical care of a child without DFCS taking custody.Legal Custodian A legal custodian of a child is defined as: A person to whom legal custody has been given by order of a court; or A public or private agency or other private organization licensed or otherwise authorized by law to receive and provide care for a child to which legal custody of the child has been given by the court.Verbal OrdersThe issuance of a verbal order usually occurs because a judge/court is unavailable after regular office hours, on holidays and weekends. When issuing a verbal order is the practice of a countys judge, and there is not an acceptable alternative for getting a signed order for the child needing protection, the county department must have clearly written procedures that specify the immediate steps staff will follow in obtaining a signed order. The written procedures should address:Situations that demand the immediate protection of a child and for which the county will proceed with a verbal order; Designated county staff who are authorized to request a verbal order from the judge;  SAAG involvement in preparing an order for the judges signature on the first business day after issuance of the verbal order;Case record documentation needed, including the date and time of all actions taken and who was involved in each step of the process; and Incorporation of these procedures into the written procedures developed by the local child abuse protocol committee.Temporary Alternative to Foster Care (TAFC) Order An order for TAFC may include one or more of the following: A temporary order authorizing or continuing any voluntary agreement between the parent, guardian, or legal custodian and DFCS; NOTE: This order shall be based upon a finding by the court that continuation in the home would be contrary to the childs welfare. The finding shall be made on an individualized basis and shall be documented in the written court order. A temporary protective order imposing conditions or limitations on the conduct of the parent, guardian, or legal custodian; An order that DFCS investigate and report to the court whether removal is necessary; or An order that the DFCS provide services designed to allow the child to remain safely in the childs home. When TAFC is ordered by the court, the order shall remain in effect until modified by the court or until the court has held the PPH. Upon issuance of an order for TAFC, a PPH will be completed no later than 72 hours.Authorization to Place or Authorization for Protective Custody In some counties, a court official or Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) intake officer has the authority, delegated by the judge, to issue an authorization to place or for protective care. The document is signed by the person delegated this duty. The document can be given directly to the SAAG, SSCM or other DFCS representative or it may be faxed to the DFCS office. This document is the agencys legal authority to hold a child.Superior Court Order An order issued by superior court granting custody/placement authority to the county department sets time limits for the duration, specifies the custodian, and outlines the custodian's rights and duties. An order without time limits stands until another order is issued. Superior court orders giving a county department custody/placement authority usually occur in connection with divorce proceedings. The placement may be time-limited while the parent, guardian, or legal custodians and/or others are being evaluated to determine the appropriate custodian. It is possible for the placement to be longer in duration if the county department is ordered to supervise, offer services to the parent, guardian or legal custodian or others and/or determine the appropriate custodian. The superior court is responsible for making the final decision about placement. It may become necessary to consult with the agencys SAAG should the superior court order appear to be incomplete or have conflicting court requirements. Required findings specified in the Juvenile Code of the Official Code of Georgia may or may not be included in the court order. Additionally, the SAAG can provide guidance on meeting case plan and periodic review requirements when superior court is involved.Disposition Orders Any order of disposition shall contain written findings of fact to support the disposition and case plan ordered. Prior to making an order of disposition, the court shall consider the following: Why the best interests and safety of the child are served by the disposition and case plan ordered, including, but not limited to: The interaction and interrelationship of the child with his/her parent, guardian or legal custodians, siblings and any other person who may significantly affect the childs best interests; The childs adjustment to his/her home, school, and community; The mental and physical health of all individuals involved; The wishes of the child as to his/her placement; The wishes of the childs parent, guardian, or legal custodian as to the custody of the child; Whether there exists a relative or other individual who, after study by DFCS, is approved to receive and care for the child; and The ability of the parent, guardian, or legal custodian of the child to care or the child in the home so that no harm will come to the child. The availability of services recommended in the case plan; What alternative dispositions or services were considered by the court and why such dispositions or services were not appropriate; The appropriateness of the placement or potential placement; and Whether reasonable efforts were made to prevent the removal and to reunify the child unless reasonable efforts were not required. The courts findings should include a brief description of what preventive and reunification efforts were made and why further efforts could not have prevented or eliminated the need for removal.An order of disposition in a dependency proceeding shall continue in force until: The purposes of the order have been accomplished and DFCS is relieved of custody by the court; or The court terminates the order; or The dependent child turns 18 unless the child receives Extended Foster Care (EFC) services or continues to receive Independent Living services.Supplemental Orders A supplemental order adopting the permanency plan shall be entered following any permanency plan hearing and no later than thirty (30) days after the court has determined that reunification efforts need not be made by DFCS. The supplemental order shall include a requirement that the SSCM, DFCS staff and other representative of the child provide the child with assistance and support in developing a transition plan that is personalized at the direction of the child and includes specific options on housing, health insurance, education, local opportunities for mentors and continuing support services, workforce supports and employment services and is as detailed as the child wishes, 90 days prior to the date the child turns 18.Permanent Guardianship If the court enters an order finding that reasonable efforts to reunify a child and family are not required and that TPR and adoption are not in the best interests of the child, the court may place the child with a permanent guardian.Permanent guardianship orders shall: Remain in effect until a child turns 18 years of age or becomes emancipated; Not be subject to review by the court unless a petition to modify, vacate or revoke the guardianship is filed; Establish a reasonable visitation schedule that allows the child to maintain meaningful contact with the parent, guardian, or legal custodians through personal visits, telephone calls, letters, or other forms of communication or restrictions on a parent, guardian, or legal custodians right to visitation.TPR Orders An order terminating the parental rights of a parent shall be without limit as to duration and shall take away the parent and childs legal rights, powers, privileges, immunities, duties, and obligations with respect to each other except the right of the child to: Receive child support from his/her parent until a final order of adoption is entered; Inherit from and through his/her parent until a final order of adoption; and Pursue any civil action against his/her parents. NOTE: The legal relationship between a child and his/her siblings shall not be severed until the relationship is terminated by a final adoption order. Despite TPR, a relatives relationship for the purpose of placement and permanency remains intact until terminated by a final order of adoption.A TPR order shall:  Contain written findings on which the order is based including the facts for determining that grounds for TPR exist and that TPR is in the best interest of the child; Be conclusive and binding on all parties upon the date of entry; Grant custody of the child in accordance with Code section §15-11-321 (see policy 17.11 Legal: Termination of Parental Rights); Inform the parent(s) to use the services of the Georgia Adoption Reunion Registry, however, failure to include this shall not affect the validity of the judgment. NOTE: The court shall transmit a copy of every final order of TPR to the Adoption Exchange, State Permanency Unit within 15 days of the filing of the order.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-17-legal-section-173-court-orders-and-placement-authority

This may take the form of any type of evaluation in which the family, the SSCM, SSS, and any other relevant family support team members, come together to formally review outcomes and levels of achievement and to decide on the next steps. At each evaluation, the progress toward achievement of the permanency plan(s) should be discussed as well as the status of placement with resource parents, visitation plan and any barriers to achieving reunification or an alternate permanency plan.Types of Reviews that Complies with Provisions of Title IV-E of the Social Security Act There are three methods of review that comply with Federal requirements: Case Review/Permanency Plan Hearings conducted by the juvenile court judge, associate judge, or judge pro tempore;Judicial Citizen Review Panel (JCRP) conducted by a court-appointed panel of citizens acting in a review and advisory capacity on behalf of the judge who must approve the findings of the panel; DFCS Panel Case Review conducted internally by DFCS staff with a three-person panel, with at least one panel member being out of the direct line of case management responsibility for either the child or family. Timely reviews continue even when children are on runaway status; TPR has occurred but is under appeal, or children are on adoptive status pending finalization.Initial, Periodic, or Other Review Hearings For initial reviews, the court shall: Provide 72 hours advanced written notice to all parties; Hear the evidence, which may include oral and written testimony offered by the parents, guardians or legal custodians, foster parents, pre-adoptive parents, and/or kin caring for the child and the SSCM; Consider any evidence, including hearsay evidence, that the court finds to be relevant, reliable, and necessary to determine the needs of a child adjudicated as a dependent child and the most appropriate case plan and permanency plan; Approve the completion of the relative search; Schedule the subsequent four-month review to be conducted by the court or JCRP; Determine the following: Whether a child continues to be a dependent child; Whether the existing case plan is still the best case plan for the child and his/her family and whether any changes are needed in the case plan, including whether a concurrent non-reunification plan is appropriate; Compliance by all participants with the case plan; Appropriateness of any recommended changes to the childs placement; Whether appropriate progress is being made on the permanency plan; Whether all legally required services are being provided to the child, his/her foster parents and his/her parent, guardian, or legal custodian;Whether visitation is appropriate and, if so, approve and establish a reasonable visitation schedule consistent with the age and developmental needs of the child;  Whether the services needed to assist the child (14 years of age and older) to make a transition from foster care to successful adulthood is being provided; and Whether reasonable efforts continue to be made to prevent or eliminate the childs removal and to reunify the family unless reasonable efforts were not required.A parent, guardian or legal custodian may request a hearing before the court within five days of receipt of the case plan when they do not agree with the initial case plan developed or the proposed revised case plan reviewed by the JCRP. Upon reviewing the case plan and hearing evidence, the court shall issue a supplemental order to incorporate any changes/revisions. Other review hearings may be held at any time by the court at the request of any party to determine the continued appropriateness of the case plan outcomes, services, and progress made to date. The overall case outcome for permanency is usually the focus of these review hearings. The court may direct additional reviews by the JCRP (see policy 17.16 Legal: Fair Hearings).Judicial Citizen Review Panels The Council of Juvenile Court Judges administers Judicial Citizen Review Panels (JCRP) in select counties/ judicial circuits. The local juvenile court judge appoints volunteers from the community to serve as JCRP panel members and they receive specialized training by JCRP staff for their role in conducting reviews for children in foster care. They are appointed as sworn officers of the court and the judge affirms their confidentiality with respect to all information discussed and in acting in the best interest of the child. Although their role is advisory, their findings and recommendations are submitted to the judge with whom final authority rests regarding the case plan. The goal of a JCRP is to work collaboratively with DFCS, the court and other agencies to ensure reunification or to identify other permanency options when reunification is not possible. The judge appoints a local Program Coordinator to schedule the reviews, mail out notification letters to all parties invited to the review, maintain all official case and JCRP records and distribute the panel recommendations to the judge, DFCS, parents, guardians or legal custodians and other appropriate agencies/parties. At the conclusion of the review, the JCRP will complete its findings and recommendations for submission to the judge and will include:The permanency plan for the child and possible achievement date; The documentation of a ""compelling reason"" should the panel select ""another planned permanent living arrangement"" as the child's permanency plan, along with an explanation as to why the other permanency options would not be in the child's best interests; The appropriateness of the current placement and services provided for the child; The visitation schedule and its outcome;  The documentation regarding compliance with outcomes of the case plan and any recommendations for changes in the outcomes or permanency plan for the child; and The findings of fact regarding DFCS efforts to: Make ""reasonable efforts to finalize the permanency plan""; Ensure that the placement continues to be appropriate and in the best interest of the child; andDetermine the services needed to assist the child (age 14 years or older) in making a transition from foster care to being able to live independently.Any party to the JCRP review may request a hearing on the proposed case plan in writing within five days after receiving a copy of the plan. The parent, guardian or legal custodian shall be notified in writing that the case plan will be submitted to the court for consideration. If no hearing is requested or scheduled by the court on its motion, the court shall: Review the proposed case plan; Enter a supplemental order incorporating the case plan as part of its disposition in the case; or Schedule a hearing within 30 days of a finding by the JCRP that there is a lack of substantial progress towards the completion of the case plan to determine whether a case plan for non-reunification is appropriate. NOTE: If the proposed case plan is for non-reunification, the SSCM shall notify the parent, guardian, or legal custodian in writing that the court will hold a permanency plan hearing within 30 calendar days of receipt of the proposed non-reunification case plan to review DFCS recommendation that reunification is no longer appropr",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-17-legal-section-172-case-reviewpermanency-plan-hearings

Review of Children on Adoptive Status
Focus Areas:

Permanency Efforts: The review should ensure that efforts are being made to find an adoptive family or finalize an adoption.
Court Responsibilities: Every six months, the court reviews the child's status to ensure that steps towards adoption or other permanency solutions are being actively pursued.
Permanency Plan Hearing:

Purpose: To determine the permanent legal status of each child in DFCS custody.

Some of these situations may include, but are not limited to: A child has experienced life-threatening maltreatment or serious injury at the hands of a parent, guardian, or legal custodian. A child was intentionally abandoned by the parent, guardian, or legal custodian. A child steadfastly refuses to return to the parent, guardian, or legal custodian, and the return could cause significant physical or emotional harm to the child. The parent, guardian, or legal custodian steadfastly refuses to have a child returned to them. The parent, guardian, or legal custodian has a significant mental illness, untreated illness or significant mental disability that renders them unable to care for the child, and/or pose a safety threat to a child.A parent, guardian or legal custodian has sexually abused the child, the offending parent, guardian, or legal custodian will have access to the child, and the non-offending parent, guardian or legal custodian fails to protect the child. A parent, guardian or legal custodian has caused the death of a child through maltreatment. The parent, guardian, or legal custodian has a chronic or severe drug or alcohol use disorder that has not been rehabilitated, rendering them unable to care for the child, and/or posing a threat to the safety of the child. This includes a parent of an infant born with prenatal substance or alcohol exposure, who is non-compliant with their substance or alcohol use disorder treatment plan and the parents substance, or alcohol use poses a safety threat to the infant.A child requires medical treatment to prevent a serious illness, disability, or death, and the parent, guardian, or legal custodian is unwilling or refuse to seek medical treatment. A non-offending parent, guardian or legal custodian is unwilling or unable to protect a child from the offending parent, guardian, or legal custodian. The parent, guardian, or legal custodian is involved in repeated, serious criminal activity or have a conviction of a felony and imprisonment which has a demonstrable negative effect on the safety of the child. The parent, guardian, or legal custodian denies serious maltreatment and is unwilling to participate in the case plan. The parent, guardian or legal custodians explanation for an injury or illness is inconsistent with the medical evaluation and/or assessment findings.When a parent, guardian, or legal custodians moderate to high-risk substance or alcohol use is a contributing factor to child maltreatment (dependency) refer them to participate in the Family Treatment Court (FTC) when the minimum eligibility criteria for participation are met (refer to the Memorandum of Understanding) in the applicable FTC jurisdiction (see policy 19.24 Case Management: Family Treatment Court). NOTE: The dependency petition/complaint shall include the recommendation for FTC participation.At its discretion, file a petition alleging dependency if DFCS has actual knowledge of the abuse, neglect or abandonment of a child or is informed of the abuse, neglect or abandonment and believes it to be true. NOTE: Such petition shall not be accepted for filing unless the court or person authorized by the court has determined and endorsed on the petition that the filing of the petition is in the best interests of the public and the child. At its discretion, file a dependency petition requesting placement authority for a child or requesting that temporary custody of a child be transferred to another party. When a TAFC order is issued, if probable cause exists, and: The child was not removed from his or her home or if a child was removed from his or her home but was released from protective custody at the PPH, a petition alleging dependency shall be filed within 30 days of the PPH; or The child was removed from his or her home, a petition alleging dependency shall be filed within five days of the PPH. NOTE: The court may continue to impose the TAFC after the PPH. Obtain approval of placement authority from the juvenile court when a child must be removed and placed in foster care. Consult with the Special Assistant Attorney General (SAAG) prior to any scheduled juvenile court hearings at least five business days prior to the hearing, if available. Immediately inform the SAAG of any discovery requests to obtain direction on the handling of the request. Adhere to the procedures and practices established by the juvenile court. Request the court appoint an attorney for an alleged dependent child as soon as practical, but no later than prior to the first court hearing that may substantially affect the interests of the child, to ensure adequate representation of the child. Adhere to the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) in accordance with policy 1.6 Administration: Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) and Transfer of Responsibility for Placement and Care to a Tribal Agency regarding:Informing the court if there is a reason to know the child is a member of a federally recognized Indian tribe; or eligible for membership in a federally recognized Indian tribe and is the biological child of a member/citizen of a federally recognized Indian tribe or a member of a Georgia recognized tribe. Notification requirements for removal and termination proceedingsNotify the court of a parent, guardian, or legal custodians military service when the parent, guardian, or legal custodian is on active military duty and serving outside the state of the court that has jurisdiction over the legal proceeding. NOTE: For the purposes of Section 521 of the Service Members Civil Relief Act (SCRA), the term state includes the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Guam.File a petition for dependency within five days of the childs PPH when the child is not released from DFCS custody at this hearing. If the child was not removed from the home or was returned at the PPH, the petition shall be filed within 30 days of the PPH. Attend all court hearings including: The PPH held within 72 hours of the childs placement into foster care. The adjudication hearing scheduled no later than 10 days after the filing of the petition for dependency if the child is in foster care. If the child is not in foster care, the adjudication hearing shall be held no later than 60 days after the filing of the petition for dependency. NOTE: If the adjudication is not completed within 60 days of the removal, the dependency petition may be dismissed without prejudice. The disposition hearing held and completed within 30 days after the conclusion of the adjudication hearing, if not held in conjunction with the adjudication hearing. Review hearings: The initial review held within 75 days following a childs removal from the home.The subsequent periodic review held four months following the initial review. NOTE: The Judicial Citizen Review Panel (JCRP) may conduct any periodic review as requested by the court. Subsequent review hearings consistent with federal law held no less frequently than once every six months (see policy 17.2 Legal: Case Review/Permanency Plan Hearings). The permanency plan hearing held: No later than 30 days after DFCS submits a non-reunification case plan to the court. No later than nine months after the date the child is considered to have entered care, for a child under seven years of age at the time a petition for dependency is filed. No later than 12 months after the date the child is considered to have entered care, for children seven years of age and older at the time a petition for dependency is filed. EXCEPTION: For siblings removed at the same time and in which at least one child is under seven years of age at the time the dependency petition is filed, the permanency plan hearing shall be held no later than nine months after the children are considered to have entered foster care. At least every six months after the initial permanency plan hearing, as long as the child remains in care or more frequently as deemed necessary by the court until the court determines that such childs permanency plan and goal have been achieved.The Termination of Parental Rights (TPR) Hearing, if applicable.Determine the date the child is considered to have entered foster care to be the date of the first judicial finding that the child has been subjected to child abuse or neglect or the date that is 60 days after the date on which the child is removed from his or her home, whichever is earlier (see Practice Guidance for guidance on calculating the time in foster care). Conduct a diligent search for parents, relatives (including the parents of the childs siblings, when that parent has legal custody of such siblings), fictive kin and others who have demonstrated an ongoing commitment to the child in accordance with policy 19.20 Case Management: Diligent Search. Submit an updated diligent search report to the court at each periodic review hearing (see policy 19.20 Case Management: Diligent Search). Submit a written report (case plan) to the court within 30 days of the removal and at each subsequent review of the disposition order. NOTE: A hearing to review the case plan shall be held if the parent, guardian or legal custodian disagrees with a proposed case plan for reunification and exercises his or her right to request a hearing before the court within five days of the receipt of the plan (see policy 10.23 Foster Care: Case Planning). At the permanency plan hearing for non-reunification: Demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that a reunification plan is not appropriate considering the childs health, safety and need for permanency. Notification to the court whether and when DFCS intends to file for TPR. NOTE: The court shall consider in-state and out-of-state permanent placement options for the child and incorporate a permanency plan for the child in the order from this hearing.PROCEDURESCourt Intervention The Social Services Case Manager (SSCM) will: Consider requesting a court hearing when: The parent, guardian, or legal custodians fail to comply with critical elements of the case plan and exhibit continued diminished protective capacities, despite documentation reflecting DFCS provided support and services necessary to achieve these critical elements.  A change of custody is recommended. A change in the specific provisions of the court order is needed. Outcomes of the case plan have been met, and it is appropriate to request to be relieved of custody/court-ordered supervision. Other individual circumstances are identified and need to be brought to the courts attention. Seek court intervention when the safety of a child cannot be assured and/or a caregiver is non-compliant and court intervention may be necessary to protect the child: In conjunction with the Social Services Supervisor (SSS) consult with the SAAG to determine whether there is a need to file a dependency complaint and/or petition either for custody of the child or TAFC.Conduct a Family Team Meeting (FTM) or other family meeting prior to any court action, when possible, to notify the family of the impending court action and possible outcomes and to discuss any changes in the safety or case plans (see policy 19.3 Case Management: Solution-Focused Family Team Meetings). Consult with the SAAG and request they file a dependency complaint and petition with juvenile court when court action is being sought. Afford the person against whom a protective order is directed due notice and an opportunity to be heard, prior to an order being granted by the court (accomplished by service of the petition as required by state law). Request that a protective order be modified, extended, or terminated by the court as deemed necessary and in the best interest of the child.When it is determined that a TAFC is needed to expedite legal intervention: In conjunction with the SSS, consult with the SAAG regarding the appropriateness of seeking a TAFC order. Prepare to present the following information in court or provide to the SAAG, if the TAFC will be obtained ex parte: The reason DFCS is requesting a TAFC order; The approved Kinship Assessment (see Practice Guidance: Temporary Alternative to Foster Care and policy 22.3 Kinship: Kinship Assessment); Services and options to prevent placement that have been explored/provided to the family and the safety issues requiring legal intervention; The legal options being considered: Temporary Guardianship (see policy 22.11 Kinship: Guardianship in Child Protective Services); Temporary custody to a third party (see policy 22.12 Kinship: Temporary Custody to a Third Party in Child Protective Services); or Temporary protective order while the child remains in their home (see policy 17.3 Legal: Court Orders and Placement Authority). Obtain and review the TAFC order. Participate in the PPH hearing. File a dependency petition when the court finds probable cause in the PPH to believe a child is a dependent child pending an adjudication hearing. Prepare for the adjudication hearing in conjunction with the SAAG to discuss DFCS recommendations and to confirm completion of any tasks ordered by the court. Document issuance of the TAFC court order in Georgia SHINES: Update the Legal Action and Outcomes Detail page. Upload the TAFC order into External Documentation. When the decision is made to remove the child: Consult with the SAAG and request they obtain authorization from the court or designated intake officer for DFCS to obtain placement authority for the child if law enforcement does not make the removal. NOTE: A verbal order may be issued by a juvenile court judge but must be followed by a written order that is obtained the first business day after the issuance of the verbal order. DFCS cannot remove children without court authorization. Provide the SAAG with all necessary and relevant supporting evidence and information pertaining to possible witnesses if the court requires a hearing or other sworn testimony/statement prior to authorizing the removal of the child. Obtain a copy of the ex parte removal order, if issued by the court, or authorization to take child into custodyDocument legal actions and outcomes following in Georgia SHINES: Upload the authorization or order into External Documentation, if not uploaded via the Case Plan Reporting System (CPRS) interface. Custody Detail page. Legal Action and Outcomes Detail page. Legal Status page. File a dependency complaint if it was not filed to obtain authorization for placement authority. NOTE: A dependency action may be filed in the county in which the child legally resides or in the county where the child is present when the proceeding is commenced provided that the child is present in that county without his parent, guardian, or legal custodian or the acts underlying the dependency allegation are alleged to have occurred in that county. This is referred to as the venue. The court may transfer the proceedings to the county in which a child legally resides, if the proceedings start in a different county (see policy 17.13 Legal: Court Transfer of Jurisdiction).Preparing for Court Prior to any court hearing, the SSCM will: Review the case record. Staff with the SSS all available information that supports DFCS position on a case. Discuss the case plan/services with the family and family support team via a Family Team Meeting (FTM) or other family meeting (see policy 19.3 Case Management: Solution-Focused Family Team Meetings). Develop a court report to present to the court, when necessary, summarizing: The background of the case. Services and/or steps taken to resolve the issues. Progress or lack thereof of the family. DFCS recommendations, including visitation if applicable. Consult with the SAAG at least five business days prior to any upcoming hearing, if available: Contact the SAAG and request a consult that will ensure timely preparation for the upcoming hearing. Apprised the SAAG of all information. All evidence, potential witnesses, and DFCS recommendations. NOTE: Include the Court Appointed Special Advocate and Guardian Ad Litem (GAL), if appropriate based on consultation with the SAAG. Notify the SAAG of the following, any time there is reason to know: When either parent, guardian or legal custodian is on active duty in the military, so the SAAG can notify the court. Whether there is reason to know the child is a member of a federally recognized Indian tribe; or eligible for membership in a federally recognized Indian tribe and is the biological child of a member/citizen of a federally recognized Indian tribe [see policy; or a member of a Georgia recognized tribe.Juvenile Court Hearings The SSCM will: For the preliminary protective hearing: Staff the case with the SSS and SAAG prior to the hearing. Be prepared to provide testimony. Ensure a dependency petition is presented to the court within five calendar days of the PPH, if the court finds probable cause to believe that the child is dependent, and the judge orders the child to remain in foster care. Update the Legal Status and/or Legal Action and Outcomes Detail pages in Georgia SHINES within 72 hours of the hearing. NOTE: If the court finds probable cause to believe the child is dependent, but does not find that protective custody is necessary, then the court shall return the child to his parent, guardian or legal custodian pending the hearing on the dependency petition. For the adjudication hearing: Ensure a staffing occurs between the investigator, investigators SSS, Permanency SSCM, Permanency SSS and SAAG to discuss the evidence to be presented, witnesses needed, etc. prior to the hearing. Be prepared to provide testimony. Update the Legal Status and/or Legal Action and Outcomes Detail pages in Georgia SHINES based on the court findings, within 72 hours of the hearing. NOTE: Such findings become the basis of the initial case plan for reunification, including any findings of dependency as a result of alcohol or other substance abuse. For the disposition hearing: Share the results of the Comprehensive Child and Family Assessment (CCFA) with the court, if available, to assist with the decision making regarding the placement and needed services. Be prepared to present agency recommendations. Present the initial case plan to the court to be entered into the disposition order. NOTE: The initial case plan must be submitted to the court within 30 days of removal and at least 48 hours prior to the disposition hearing. Present the initial diligent search to be entered into the disposition order. NOTE: The initial diligent search must be submitted to the court within 30 days of removal (see policy 19.20 Case Management: Diligent Search). Update the Legal Status and/or Legal Action and Outcomes Detail pages in Georgia SHINES within 72 hours of the hearing. For a review hearing or permanency plan hearing: Staff the case with the SSS and SAAG to discuss the evidence to be presented, witnesses needed, etc. Submit a case plan to the court five days prior to the permanency plan hearing (see policy 10.23 Foster Care: Case Planning) including: A recommended permanency plan for the child. An estimation of when the plan will be achieved. Documentation of the reasonable efforts taken by DFCS to finalize the permanent placement of the child. Submit an updated diligent search to the court at each periodic review hearing (see policy 19.20 Case Management: Diligent Search).Be prepared to provide testimony. Request the court review the following, if a permanency plan hearing is being held on a case where voluntary surrenders were obtained: The circumstances of the child.Child-specific recruitment strategies DFCS has utilized, such as the use of state, regional and national adoption exchanges and/or electronic exchanges. Any other steps taken by DFCS to pursue a permanent home for the child. Update the Legal Status and/or Legal Action and Outcomes Detail pages in Georgia SHINES within 72 hours of the hearing.The SSS will: Review the case record including any documented evidence to help determine whether: Court intervention is warranted; The type of legal intervention needed to protect a child (i.e., protective order, TAFC, custody); Sufficient evidence exists to support: Present or impending danger. Each allegation of the dependency petition. The case plan or permanency plan to be considered by the court. Services were provided to prevent foster care placement; and ICWA notification requirements when the child is an Indian child as defined in ICWA. The initial diligent search is completed and submitted to the court within 30 days of the childs entry into foster care;

also see Procedures on Preparing for Court). Attend court hearings, as needed, to provide guidance and support to the SSCM. Verify documentation of legal actions in Georgia SHINES and that court orders and other legal documents were uploaded to External Documentation.PRACTICE GUIDANCEPreserving and strengthening families to prevent the unnecessary removal of children from their homes is an integral part of permanency planning. It recognizes that most childrens needs for permanency are met by the continuity of family relationships. In many ways the court acts as a gatekeeper for children entering and exiting the foster care system. Consequently, DFCS and the court must work in partnership and share accountability in ensuring permanency at the earliest possible time for children. To enhance the partnership with the court and ensure the best outcomes for children and families, the SSCM should be knowledgeable about the following: The rights, roles and responsibilities of the County Department when serving as custodian of a child in foster care. The procedural safeguards for the parent, guardian, or legal custodians of children in foster care.The juvenile court process, including courtroom etiquette. The applicable federal laws and sections of the Official Code of Georgia (O.C.G.A.). Court order requirements for Title IV-E funding. Timeframes for custody and other legal actions.Court Intervention to Protect Children Determining when to initiate juvenile court action is one of the most difficult and important decisions for DFCS staff. Involving the court too quickly may be a misuse of the authority granted to DFCS and the court. Not involving the authority and protection of the court when a child is not safe or is at significant risk may constitute a failure to adequately protect the child and failure to discharge the authority given to DFCS. Therefore, when making the decision whether to pursue court intervention, the health and safety of the child is the paramount concern. Some caregivers cannot or will not protect their child or ensure the childs needs are met; and despite reasonable efforts to remedy or improve the circumstances leading to the abuse or neglect, a child may remain in imminent danger. When making critical decisions about whether to seek court action to remove a child from the home as the only alternative for the child to be protected and safe, a childs right to protection and safety outweigh a caregivers right to the child.Service Members Civil Relief Act (SCRA) Under the provisions of SCRA, a person on active-duty military service, or someone on his/her behalf, may petition the court for a stay of the proceeding if he/she feels his/her military service materially affects his/her ability to defend himself/herself. The court does not automatically grant each request for a stay; only when it is determined that the parent, guardian, or legal custodians ability to defend himself/herself is materially affected by military service will a stay be granted. The court may, on its own motion, postpone the proceeding for the presence of the parent, guardian, or legal custodian.Childs Attorney A child should have an attorney appointed before the first court hearing which may substantially affect the interest of the child in order to ensure the childs interest are adequately represented. A childs attorney owes the child the duties imposed by the laws of Georgia in an attorney-client relationship.Parents/Guardians/Legal Custodians Attorney Whenever a parent, guardian or legal custodian is represented by an attorney, the County Department shall recognize the implications of the attorney-client relationship. The SSCM needs to ensure the SAAG is informed of the attorney representing the parent, guardian, or legal custodian. If the parent, guardian, or legal custodians attorney is appointed by the court, the attorney cannot be relieved of responsibility until the court issues an order indicating he/she is no longer the attorney of record. If an attorney has entered an appearance in the juvenile court, he/she remains the parents attorney for the matter until the court has permitted the attorney to withdraw by appropriate order. If the parent, guardian, or legal custodian seeks to bring an attorney as his/her representative to any conference or review held at the County Department or other location, the County Department shall consult with the SAAG regarding the attorneys presence and whether the SAAG should also be present.PartyA party means the state, a child, parent, guardian, legal custodian, or other person subject to any judicial proceeding under Chapter 11 of Title 15 of the Official Code of Georgia. However, for the purpose of CHINS and delinquency actions, only the child and the state shall be a party. A party to a hearing has the right to: Have an attorney at all stages of the proceedings. Be present. Be heard. Present evidence. Cross-examine witnesses. Examine pertinent court files and records. Appeal the orders of the court. NOTE: All children subject to a dependency action are parties. The court may exclude a child from any part of the dependency proceedings if the court determines that it is not in the childs best interest to be present. The attorney for an excluded child shall not be excluded from the proceedings.Discovery Prior to any court proceedings, a party may request information from another party to assist them in the presentation of their case in court. Although state law dictates that upon written request a party to a proceeding shall have full access to certain information for inspection, copying or photographing, these requests are usually handled by the attorneys (i.e., SAAG, parent, guardian or legal custodians attorney, childs attorney, etc.) in the proceedings. If DFCS receives a written request from the attorney for a parent or child in a dependency case for records or information, DFCS should immediately notify the SAAG of the request. In order to meet the discovery requirements of the Juvenile Court Code, the SSCM should immediately request to staff the case with the SAAG if the following information is requested: The names and telephone numbers of each witness likely to be called to testify at the hearing by another party. A copy of any formal written statement made by the child or any witness concerning the testimony of the witness that a party intends to call as a witness at the hearing. Any scientific or other report that is intended to be introduced at a hearing or that pertains to physical evidence that is intended to be introduced unless a court order or written consent from the appropriate person is required.Any drug screen concerning the child or his/her parent, guardian, or legal custodian.Any case plan concerning the child or his or her parent, guardian, or legal custodian. Any visitation scheduled related to the child.Photographs and any physical evidence that are intended to be introduced at any hearing. Copies of any police reports that are included in the basis for the petition. Any other relevant evidence not requiring consent or a court order. The SAAG will provide direction to DFCS concerning the provision of information or records, including responses to discovery requests, to a child or parents attorney while a dependency case is pending in the juvenile court.Upon presentation of a court order or written consent from the appropriate person permitting access, any party shall have access to the following:Any psychological, developmental, physical, mental, or emotional health or other assessments of the child or his/her family, parent, guardian, or legal custodian. Any school record concerning the child. Any medical record concerning the child. Transcriptions, recordings, and summaries of any oral statement of the child or of any witness, except child abuse reports that are confidential. Any FTM report or multidisciplinary team meeting report concerning the child or his/her parent, guardian, or legal custodian. Supplemental police reports, if any, regarding an occurrence that is included in the basis of the petition. Immigration records concerning the child. NOTE: If DFCS receives a court order providing access to any of the above, immediately staff the request with the SAAG.Any request for discovery shall be complied with no later than five days from receipt of the request or 72 hours prior to any hearing unless the timing of the request does not allow the party to meet these timeframes. If a request for discovery is made fewer than 48 hours prior to the hearing, the response should be produced in a timely manner. DFCS shall immediately inform the SAAG of all discovery requests and the SAAG should assist the County Department with all discovery requests.Date Child is Considered to Have Entered Foster Care When a child is alleged to be a dependent child, the date such child is considered to have entered foster care shall be the date of the first judicial finding that such child has been subjected to child abuse or neglect or the date that is 60 days after the date on which such child is removed from his or her home, whichever is earlier. In order to meet time frames for permanency plan hearings required under Title IV-E rules and regulations, DFCS staff is advised to schedule permanency plan hearings using the removal date as the beginning point from which the permanency plan hearing time limits are calculated. As an example, an initial permanency plan hearing that must be held no later than 12 months from the time a child is considered to have entered foster care would be scheduled 12 months from the date the child was removed from the home. This practice will ensure that hearings are held within the time limits required by federal law.Emergency Removal DFCS does not have the authority to remove a child without the written consent of the parent, guardian or legal custodian or order of the court, except in short-term emergency care situations (see policies 3.21 Special Circumstance: Intakes Involving S",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-17-legal-section-171-juvenile-court-process

In these circumstances, DFCS shall determine whether a minimum 72-hour notice, if appropriate, shall be obtained from the CCI or CPA family foster home. If the 72-hour notice is not appropriate, the reasons for the failure to notify in advance must be documented in the childs record. Obtain a discharge summary from the RBWO provider, at the time of notification of a placement move or disruption, the discharge summary shall include: General information covering the childs placement; Progress; Challenges; and Recommendations for services and supports the child will need to be successful at home or in the next placement. Only make the decision for placement disruption after all possible interventions to maintain the child in their current placement setting have proven unsuccessful including participating in a Placement Team Meeting as requested.

Decisions about the childs long-term or continued placement in the program should not be made during a crisis. At best, a decision to discharge a child from a placement should be made by mutual discussion between the provider and the Division concerning the childs situation, either in a face-to-face or telephone conference. The 14-calendar-day notice should be used to prepare all parties involved for the move. Communication with the current CCI/CPA foster family, child and the potential placement resource is necessary to ensure a smooth transition and increase the chance of placement success. The CCI/CPA foster family and the child should be informed of the date and time the move will take place so the placement resource can prepare the child. The child should be able to say his/her good-byes to the CCI/CPA foster family he/she is leaving, whenever appropriate. Refer to policy 10.3 Foster Care: Changes in Placement, 10.22 Foster Care: Permanency Planning and 10.27 Foster Care: Case Closure and for additional requirements and procedures for placement changes. For placement disruptions that occur within 10 days of placement or admission to the provider, providers will document a review of the initial placement decision and identify any changes needed in the admissions review or placement matching process. Providers will have and follow their protocol on addressing foster parents who have patterns of ejecting children within 60 days of placement or where other disruption patterns are identified.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-16-room-board-watchful-oversight-rbwo-section-167-discharge

GA :: Child Welfare Policy Manual :: Chapter 16 Room Board Watchful Oversight (RBWO) :: Section 16.0 Introduction To Room Board Watchful Oversight (RBWO),Georgia,Rules,"2023, 2022, 2021","Administrative process, Definitions, Permanency, Services while in care - Educational, Services while in care - Medical, Services while in care - Mental Health, Use of federal money (including Title IV-E)",,,"DISCUSSIONThe mission of the Division of Family and Children Services (DFCS) foster care program is to strengthen families, protect children from further abuse and ensure that every child has a permanent family. The private provider community is an important and integral part of DFCSs ability to achieve its mission. The Room Board and Watchful Oversight (RBWO) providers follow and support the DFCS mission. RBWO is the provision of lodging, food and attentive responsible care to children. Providers shall be responsible for the provision or acquisition of services to ensure that each childs physical, social, emotional, educational/vocational, nutritional, spiritual/cultural and permanency needs are met. These services are defined as follows: Physical  all health services pertaining to the body (medical and dental). This includes medication monitoring, documenting and administering by staff or foster parents trained in medication dispensing. Social  the provision of an environment in which the childs relationships with peers, staff, significant others and community are improved through the use of recreational and leisure activities. Emotional - a support network that implements recommendations of treatment providers; provides access to treatment; and recognizes behaviors, such as anger, and negative and positive stress, often accompanied by physiological or psychological changes. Educational/Vocational  enrollment of youth in an accredited educational school system; monitoring of progress and support of the youths education by participation in student support team (SST) meetings, individual education planning (IEP) meetings, parent/teacher conferences and disciplinary meetings; opportunities for participation in school-related extra-curricular activities; for those youth who have completed high school or who have achieved a high school diploma or GED, access to academic or vocational opportunities that will prepare them to lead self-sufficient lives. Nutritional  the provision or acquisition of food services to ensure healthy physical and emotional development, which is inclusive of the childs religious, cultural, and health needs in accordance with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) guidelines for servings per child.Spiritual/Cultural  awareness, sensitivity and competence in understanding the childs and familys religious values, belief system, mores, customs, training, social growth or development. Permanency  providing the child with continuous and guided interaction with family members and significant others for the purpose of transitioning the child back to the home and community and/or working to secure another permanent option for the child. Permanency planning begins during the admission process and continues through discharge.The DFCS Office of Provider Management (OPM) is responsible for establishing and maintaining standards for child placing agency (CPA) foster family homes, child caring institutions (CCI), and Independent Living Programs which are reasonably in accord with recommended standards of national organizations concerned with standards for such institutions or homes, including standards related to admission policies, safety, sanitation, and protection of civil rights and which shall permit use of the reasonable and prudent parenting standard. The standards so established are applied by DFCS to any CPA foster family home or CCI receiving funds under Titles IV-E or IV-B. The standards shall require, as a condition of each contract entered into by a CCI to provide foster care, the presence on-site of at least one official who, with respect to any child placed at the CCI, is designated to be the caregiver who is authorized to apply the reasonable and prudent parent standard to decisions involving the participation of the child in age or developmentally-appropriate activities, and who is provided with training in how to use and apply the reasonable and prudent standard in the same manner as prospective foster parents are provided the training pursuant to paragraph 471(a)(24). The standards for foster family homes and CCIs shall include policies related to the liability of foster parents and private entities under contract by the State involving the application of the reasonable and prudent parent standard, to ensure appropriate liability for caregivers when a child participates in an approved activity and the caregiver approving the activity acts in accordance with the reasonable and prudent parent standard. DFCS may provide waivers of such standards only on a case-by-case basis for non-safety standards (as determined by DFCS) in relative foster family homes for specific children in care. In order for a child to be eligible for Title IV-E funding, the licensing file for a CCI must contain documentation which verifies that safety considerations with respect to the staff of the institution have been addressed. In order for a child to be eligible for title IV-E funding, the licensing file for a CCI must contain documentation which verifies that safety considerations with respect to the staff of the institution have been addressed. DFCS shall provide procedures for any CCI, including a group home, residential treatment center, shelter, or other congregate care setting, to conduct criminal record checks, including fingerprint-based checks of national crime information databases (as defined in section 534(f)(3)(A) of title 28, United States Code), and child abuse registry checks, on any adult working in a CCI, including a group home, residential treatment center, shelter, or other congregate care setting (see policy 19.8 Case Management: Criminal Records Checks and 19.9 Case Management: Safety Screenings).RBWO providers contracted with DFCS adhere to a set of guiding principles outlined in the RBWO Minimum Standards. RBWO Minimum Standards are focused on securing positive permanency, health and education outcomes for children and on reducing risks to their welfare and safety. Providers shall aim to provide the best care possible for the children under their supervision. Observing the Minimum Standards is essential, but only a part of the overall responsibility to safeguard and promote the welfare of each individual child placed. The Minimum Standards are intended to be qualitative, in that they provide a tool for judging the quality of care provided and are also designed to be measurable. The OPM shall monitor RBWO providers against the Minimum Standards using annual comprehensive and random safety reviews. During monitoring visits, the OPM will look for evidence that the requirements are being met. Provider practices that exceed the requirements of the Minimum Standards will also be identified and documented in the OPM monitoring report. The following are the six broad areas comprising the Minimum Standards: Safety; Quality of care;Permanency support; Family foster homes; Child caring institutions; and General administrative matters.OPM may execute the following reviews of contracted CCIs/CPAs and Independent Living Programs (ILP) to ensure adherence to the high standard of care and contractual obligations: Annual Comprehensive Review (ACR) - an overall assessment of provider performance in the areas of safety, permanency and well-being; it is done to determine the providers compliance with RBWO Minimum Standards as well as DFCS policy. ACRs are conducted on each CCI and CPA at least annually without prior notice to the provider. However, the list of files selected for review is withheld until the actual ACR. ACRs can take approximately two to four days to complete depending on the size of the agency. The ACR includes: Staff and/or foster parents and child record reviews; Staff and/or foster parents and child interviews;Physical plant inspection;All service delivery aspects incorporating safety, permanency and well-being; and Review of agencys policies. Safety Review (SR)  conducted to assess and identify immediate safety issues within a CPA, CCI, or Independent Living Program (ILP) and ensure that the agency staff and/or foster parent(s) have the capacity and support needed to maintain the childs safety. During a SR: The family composition is assessed; Children are interviewed; Staff and/or foster parent(s) are interviewed; and A walkthrough of the facility/home is conducted. A SR is designed to be employed randomly and frequently across all CCIs, CPAs, and ILPs. A SR may be used in response to risk and safety concerns instead of a full comprehensive review. A SR usually takes about 60 to 90 minutes to complete, and prior notice to the provider is not provided.Foster Home Approval Review and Re-Evaluations  a random desk review of newly approved or re-approved foster homes. During this review, documentation is reviewed to determine if DFCS policies 14.10 Resource Development: Initial Family Evaluation and 14.13 Resource Development: Family Re-evaluation were followed during the approval or re-approval process (CPAs only). Performance Based Placement Review  a review of self-reported provider data in GA Shines. Self-reported data includes staff training, placement stability, sibling contacts, Health Checks (medical & dental visits), academic supports, every child every month (ECEM) visits and general contacts. This visit is announced. Safety Desk Check  A Safety Desk Check is conducted quarterly to review all safety screenings completed on employees of providers (i.e., Criminal Background (OIG), CPS History Check, Pardons and Parole, GA Sex Offender Registry and Department of Corrections).Description of Program Types Child Caring Institution (CCI): A CCI is a private or public child care institution that accommodates no more than 25 children and is licensed by the State in which it is situated or has been approved by the agency of such State responsible for licensing or approval of institutions of this type as meeting the standards for approval except, in the case of a child who has attained 18 years of age, the term includes a supervised setting in which the individual is living independently. Children in Georgia age 18 and older are not eligible for Title IV-E funding. The definition of CCI for Title IV-E purposes may not include detention facilities, forestry camps, training schools or any other facility operated primarily for the detention of children who are determined to be delinquent. The children in CCIs are residing outside of their own home environment. These facilities provide care, supervision and oversight in a residential setting, including neighborhood-based group homes, campus-based arrangements and self-contained facilities. The CCIs Human Service Professionals or Child Care Workers work as a team to provide a stabilizing and nurturing environment that breaks down barriers to support the child stepping down to a less restrictive environment. Maternity and Parenting Support Programs Maternity Programs (MP) are specialized, RBWO programs established for the purpose of caring for pregnant youth 21 years of age or younger. Services may be provided by a CCI or CPA and include full-time residential care, support and supervision for more than one pregnant youth. Program providers who offer services in a residential setting must be licensed through Residential Child Care Licensing (RCCL) as a Maternity Home. A Maternity Home may provide services to pregnant youth, before, during or within two weeks after childbirth for a maximum period of eight weeks following delivery unless also providing Parenting Support Program (AKA Second Chance Home) services.Parenting Support Programs (PSP), also called Second Chance Homes, are specialized, adult supervised RBWO programs established for young mothers and their children. A PSP is a licensed maternity home that provides full-time residential care, support, and supervision to pregnant and parenting youth (21 years of age or younger) and their children. Services can be provided by a CCI or CPA (in a residential setting, supportive foster home, transitional or independent living environment) and are expected to last for more than an eight-week period following delivery. Program services help young mothers develop parenting skills and improve their knowledge of child development. Additionally, services assist with education, job training, family budgeting, health and nutrition, and transitioning to independent living. PSP providers who offer services in a residential setting must be licensed through RCCL as a Maternity Home and may serve no more than a total of 16 residents (i.e. parenting youth and their children).Qualified Residential Treatment Program (QRTP)  a QRTP is a program that: Has a trauma-informed treatment model that is designed to address the needs (including clinical needs as appropriate) of children with serious emotional or behavioral disorders or disturbances and, with respect to a child, is able to implement the treatment identified for the child by the assessment of the child required under section 475A(c) of the Social Security Act; Has registered or licensed nursing staff and other licensed clinical staff who: Provide care within the scope of their practice as defined by State law; Are on-site according to the treatment model referred to in subparagraph (a); and Are available 24 hours a day and 7 days a week; To extent appropriate, and in accordance with the childs best interests, facilitates participation of family members in the childs treatment program; Facilitates outreach to the family members of the child, including siblings, documents how the outreach is made (including contact information), and maintains contact information for any known biological family and fictive kin of the child; Documents how family members are integrated into the treatment process for the child, including post-discharge, and how sibling connections are maintained; Provides discharge planning and family-based aftercare support for at least six months post-discharge; and Is licensed in accordance with section 471(a)(10) of the Social Security Act and is accredited by any of the following independent, not-for-profit organizations: The Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF). The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO). The Council on Accreditation (COA). Any other independent, not-for-profit accrediting organization approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. NOTE: Georgia has not implemented QRTPsChildrens Transition Care Center (CTCC) - provides a temporary, home-like environment for medically fragile children, technology-dependent children and children with special health care needs, who are deemed clinically stable by a physician but are dependent on life-sustaining medications, treatments and equipment. These children require assistance with activities of daily living to facilitate transitions from a hospital or other facility.Outdoor Child Caring Program Specialty Camp (OCCP) - provides room, board and watchful oversight in a wilderness or camp environment that is designed to improve the emotional and behavioral adjustment of the children in care. The use of physical, environmental, athletic and other challenging activities is designed to improve the functioning of the children and to teach them pro-social and adaptive skills. Independent Living Program (ILP)  a specialized RBWO program for youth 18 through 21 years of age. ILP is different from transitional living in that youth may live in an alternative living arrangement (i.e., community-based housing) rather than a group home or other residential type facility. Independent living placements shall begin no earlier than a youths 18th birthday. Youth in ILP will experience graduated independence regarding program expectations, skill development and levels or types of supervision provided. The goal of an independent living placement is to prepare youth to become socially, emotionally and personally independent of social services while connecting them to life-long permanency connections and laying the foundation for the pursuit of educational and career opportunities. Transitional Living Program (TLP) - a specialized RBWO program for youth at least 16 years of age. Youth may be older than 18 years old if they have agreed to participate in the Extended Foster Care program. Transitional living is designed for youth who are ready to enter a phase of care that will eventually transition them to independent living. Transitional living affords youth an opportunity to practice basic independent living skills in a variety of settings with decreasing degrees of supervision. This specialized RBWO placement provides youth the opportunity to experience increased personal responsibility, so youth can become responsible for their own care when they exit foster care. The goal of a transitional living placement is to prepare youth to become socially, emotionally and personally independent of social services while connecting them to lifelong permanency connections and laying the foundation for the pursuit of educational and career opportunities.Child Placing Agency (CPA): A CPA is an agency that places children in foster and adoptive homes for individualized care, supervision and oversight. CPAs are responsible for assessing the appropriateness of the room, board and watchful oversight that the prospective foster and adoptive families will provide. The CPAs employees and their foster and adoptive parents work as a team to provide a stabilizing and nurturing environment that promotes safety, permanency and well-being. Foster Family Home A foster family home is the home of an individual or family approved as meeting the standards established by the State licensing or approval authority(ies) that provides 24-hour out-of-home care for children. The term may include group homes, agency-operated boarding homes or other facilities licensed or approved for the purpose of providing foster care by DFCS. Foster families that are approved must be held to the same standards as foster family homes that are licensed. Anything less than full licensure or approval is insufficient for meeting Title IV-E eligibility requirements. A foster family home may be operated by a CCI or a CPA.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-16-room-board-watchful-oversight-rbwo-section-160

These actions include: Custody Reviews Protective Custody Services Georgia Court as the Sending Agency Out of State Foster Home Out of State Residential Placement (Group Home) Interstate VisitsRelocation of Family Units Status Offenders return to state of residencePROCEDURESCustody Reviews (Court and Subsidies):For cases in which the Georgia Court granted permanent custody of a child to a relative prior to January 1, 2014, the Juvenile Court Judge reviews the circumstances of the child in the permanent custody of a relative every 12 or 36 months, based on the established jurisdiction where custody was originally transferred to the relative and location of the relative (in state or out of state). If DFCS is requested to complete the court review, ICPC requirements apply. Per policy 22.8 Kinship: Financial and Non-Financial Supports for Children in Foster Care or Who Have Achieved Permanency, if a relative is approved to receive Relative Care Subsidy and relocates to another state, the legal county of the child shall make subsidy payments as long as all eligibility criteria are met. Georgia will continue to be responsible for subsidy payments for eligible children as long as a Georgia court retains legal jurisdiction and the child remains eligible. Should the relative placement no longer be appropriate and/or there is a court order changing the custody arrangements, the RCS payments are terminated. Refer to policy 22.8 Kinship: Financial and Non-Financial Supports for Children in Foster Care or Who Have Achieved Permanency for the procedures for terminating the RCS. NOTE: There are no new relative subsidies established effective 1/1/ 2014.Protective Custody Services This situation presents when (1) protective services and/or supervision of a family is needed in Georgia (Georgia is receiving state) or in another state (Georgia is sending state) and (2) the court has established jurisdiction. In such cases, the court becomes the sending agency and ICPC applies. When Georgia is the sending/legal state, the county department shall request the court to sign Interstate Compact Placement Request (ICPC-100A) and to be listed on the form in the two sections regarding financial responsibility.If the court will not agree to retain jurisdiction or be identified as responsible for the placement, the county department by order of the appropriate court, can be listed in the section regarding responsibility. The county director or designee must sign the Interstate Compact Placement Request (ICPC-100A). Information in these cases may be limited. A cover letter, court order and any available information should be collated in three packets and forwarded along with the Interstate Compact Placement Request (ICPC-100A) to the ICPC office. A copy of the ICPC packet is to be uploaded into External Documentation in SHINES. NOTE: An open child protective services case without a protective order is not subject to the Compact. Neither are protective services situations, which do not involve a court in another state for court-ordered supervision or placement. For such situations, the county department should respond directly to the agency making the request. If a Georgia family receiving child protective services leaves the state, the county department should send a request for services directly to the agency in the other state. Refer to the APWA Directory for addresses. Do not submit an Interstate Compact Placement Request (ICPC-100A)Georgia Court as the Sending Agency Typically, when a Georgia court becomes the sending agency, the situation involves relatives who are in dispute over placement plans for the child. ICPC does not apply to most divorce custody cases. If there is a third party involved other than the parents, ICPC may apply. When such situations arise, the Georgia ICPC Administrator will assist with clarification on these cases.Placement with an Out of State Foster Home Under special circumstances, an out of state foster home may be sought for placement of a child who is in the custody of Georgia DFCS. Relatives or non-relative foster homes may also be sought for children in need of placement. Follow the steps outlined below: The cover letter should request the receiving state to complete a foster home study. The request should provide the amount of per diem Georgia will pay, and ask the receiving state to accept this per diem rate for the family if the home is approved.An out of state non-relative may be considered for placement through the compact if there is reason to believe that this placement is in the best interest of the child. The childs IV-E status should be documented when making this referral. NOTE: If parental rights have been terminated by a Georgia court and placement is sought with a birth family member, a foster home study will be requested rather than a relative home study.Out of State Residential Placement (Group Home) In rare instances, a child in Georgia DFCS custody may require an out of state group home placement. When such circumstances exist, a child may be placed in an approved out of state group home, childcare institution or basic IFC facility. A multidisciplinary team meeting must be held to discuss the recommendation to place a child in DFCS custody in an out of state group home to discuss the following: The rationale for considering such a placement; What in-state services and facilities were used or considered; Why in-state services are not being recommended; d. Any additional information required by the placement facility must be shared. Prior to initiating the ICPC procedures, obtain: Approval from the County Director; b. A waiver from the Regional Director and the Director of Foster Care Services. Upon receipt of the approved waiver, apply the referral procedures referenced in policy 16.3 Room Board and Watchful Oversight (RBWO): RBWO Placement Referral. Initiate ICPC procedures. When an out-of-state group home placement is recommended or made, the case plan shall comply with O.C.G.A. § 39-4-4, the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children. Update the case plan to include the following: The recommendation of the multidisciplinary team and the rationale for such particular placement; Which in-state services or facilities were used or considered and why they were not recommended;Why the selected placement is in the best interest of the child.Interstate Visits An interstate visit is not considered a placement. Visits and placements are distinguished on the basis of purpose, duration, and the intent of the person or agency with court-ordered responsibility for planning for the child. An interstate visit shall not exceed thirty (30) days and is not subject to ICPC. The purpose of a visit is to provide the child with a familial, social or cultural experience of short duration, such as an overnight camp or visiting with a friend or relative who has not assumed legal responsibility for said child. A visit may not be approved or extended if the approval or extension exceeds thirty (30) days. A visit or proposed stay of longer than thirty (30) days constitutes a placement event, and must conform to ICPC regulations. If at the onset of a visit the stay does not have a planned ending date or if its duration is not clear, it shall be considered a placement or proposed placement and must comply with ICPC regulations.An interstate visit should not be authorized unless the visiting resource is found to be a safe environment for the child subject to the request. Home assessments and supervision are not required when children are visiting out of state. Request of, or receipt of a request for a home study or supervision made by a person or agency that sends or proposes to send a child on a visit must be explored with the person or entity to determine if the plan is for the child to remain with the visiting resource. Under such circumstances, ICPC regulations and policy apply.Relocation of Family Units A placement initially intrastate in nature becomes an interstate placement subject to the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC) when a childs principal residence permanently relocates to another state, except as set forth herein. A request that the receiving state assess and approve the placement is mandatory. The sending state must retain legal jurisdiction for the child until approval to do so is provided by the receiving state. Assurance that a safe and stable placement is maintained for the child subject to court jurisdiction is the responsibility of both the sending and receiving states. Additionally, it is the intent of the Compact that services and supports for the child and placement resource are uninterrupted, that the placement resource and sending state comply with the requirements of the receiving state, and that both states comply with all applicable state and federal laws, rules and regulations. These guidelines apply to the relocation of a child and the placement resource where supervision is ongoing. A request for a home study solely for the purpose of a periodic assessment of the placement where there is no ongoing supervision are not addressed by this process and shall be a matter of courtesy between the states. The sending state has the option to contract privately for a periodic assessment of the placement.Status Offenders Return to State of Residence DFCS recognizes its responsible for the proper supervision or return of status offenders who are on probation or parole and who have absconded, escaped or run away from supervision and control and in so doing have endangered their own safety and the safety of others. Additionally, DFCS recognizes that each state is responsible for the safe return of juveniles who have run away from home and in doing so have left their state of residence.FORMS AND TOOLSAssociation of Administrators of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children  ICPC ArticlesAssociation of Administrators of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children  ICPC RegulationsInterstate Compact Placement Request (ICPC-100A)Interstate Compact Placement Request - Instructions (ICPC-100A-I)",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-15-interstate-compact-placement-children-icpc-section-156

If such concurrence is not given, the sending agency shall retain jurisdiction over the child as otherwise provided under Article V of the ICPC. A provisional denial means that the receiving state cannot approve a provisional placement pending the more comprehensive home study or assessment process due to issues that need to be resolved.PRACTICE GUIDANCEICPC Regulation 7The intent of this regulation is to expedite ICPC approval or denial by a receiving state for the placement of a child with a parent, step-parent, grandparent, adult uncle or aunt, adult brother or sister, or the child's guardian, and to: Help protect the safety of children while minimizing the potential trauma to children caused by interim or multiple placements while ICPC approval to place with a parent or relative is being sought through a more comprehensive home study process. Provide the sending state court and/or sending agency with expedited approval or denial. An expedited denial would underscore the urgency for the sending state to explore alternative placement resources.For cases involving a child who is under the jurisdiction of a court as a result of action taken by a child welfare agency, the court has the authority to determine custody and placement of the child or has delegated said authority to the child welfare agency as the child is no longer in the home of the parent from whom the child was removed, and the child is being considered for placement in another state with a parent, step-parent, grandparent, adult uncle or aunt, adult brother or sister, or the childs guardian. One of the following criteria must be met in order to be considered a Regulation 7 case: Unexpected dependency due to a sudden or recent incarceration, incapacitation or death of a parent or guardian. Incapacitation means a parent or guardian is unable to care for a child due to a medical, mental or physical condition of a parent or guardian; or The child sought to be placed is four years of age or younger, including older siblings sought to be placed with the same proposed caregiver; or The court finds that any child in the sibling group sought to be placed has a substantial relationship with the proposed caregiver. Substantial relationship means the proposed caregiver has a familial or mentoring role with the child, has spent more than cursory time with the child, and has established more than a minimal bond with the child; or The child is currently in an emergency placement.This regulation shall not apply if: The child has already been placed in violation of the ICPC in the receiving state, unless a visit has been approved in writing by the receiving state Compact Administrator and a subsequent order entered by the sending state court authorizing the visit with a fixed return date in accordance with Regulation 9.The intention of the sending state is for licensed or approved foster care or adoption. In the event the intended placement [must be parent, step-parent, grandparent, adult aunt or uncle, adult brother or sister, or guardian as per Article VIII(a)] is already licensed or approved in the receiving state at the time of the request, such licensing or approval would not preclude application of this regulation. The court places the child with a parent from whom the child was not removed, the court has no evidence the parent is unfit, does not seek any evidence from the receiving state the parent is either fit or unfit, and the court relinquishes jurisdiction over the child immediately upon placement with the parent.FORMS AND TOOLSAssociation of Administrators of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children  ICPC ArticlesAssociation of Administrators of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children  ICPC RegulationsInterstate Compact Placement Request (ICPC-100A)Interstate Compact Placement Request - Instructions (ICPC-100A-I)Sending State Priority Home Study Request (ICPC-101)Sending State Priority Home Study Request - Instructions (ICPC-101-I)Statement of Case Manager/Potential Placement/Party Under Regulation 7",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-15-interstate-compact-placement-children-icpc-section-154

The timely assessment of relative placements is critical to assuring that children in foster care maintain important family connections, experience placement stability, and achieve safety, well-being and permanency, while also impacting each states achievement of performance benchmarks. For this reason, the countys completion of the home study as thoroughly and quickly as possible is essential. Georgia ICPC Administrators are subject matter experts in the law and regulations governing interstate placements. Maintaining open communication with the assigned ICPC Administrator ensures decisions agreed upon are in the best interests of the child(ren) addressed in the requests. SHINES is the official case record and must be utilized to document all activities related to such requests from other states for the assessment of relative, foster and adoptive resources. Due to the child(ren) subject to the request not being in the custody of the State of Georgia, the Georgia ICPC Administrator shall assume the role of the primary worker and input the Intake that initiates services into SHINES. While the County SSCM is assigned as a secondary worker, the responsibility for assuring all case management responsibilities are completed rests with the County DFCS SSCM. The standard for assuring all documents and case activities are entered/uploaded into Georgia SHINES is within 72 hours of occurrence.FORMS AND TOOLSAssociation of Administrators of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children  ICPC ArticlesAssociation of Administrators of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children  ICPC RegulationsField Fiscal Services Financial Manual 2301 Direct Benefits: Family Foster CareInterstate Compact Report on the Childs Placement Status (ICPC-100B)Interstate Compact Report on the Childs Placement Status (ICPC-100B-I)",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-15-interstate-compact-placement-children-icpc-section-153

The home study report shall: Assess the safety and suitability of the home environment for the placement of the child(ren) that are the subject of the ICPC request; Articulate the extent to which the assessed home would meet the needs of the child(ren); and May or may not include a statement approving or denying permission to place the child(ren): In the event the component of the study involving the education and training requirements for the prospective placement resource is incomplete, the report can be completed with a reference to the anticipated date that the training requirements will be completed. Final approval or denial of the placement resource shall be provided by the receiving ICPC Administrator in the form of a signed ICPC request as soon as practical but no later than 180 calendar days from receipt of the initial home study request. The six month approval window is to accommodate licensure and/or receiving state requirements applicable to foster or adoptive home study requirements. The approval provided by the receiving state expires six months from the date the ICPC request was signed by the receiving state. If the child(ren) are not placed with the placement resource within six months of approval by the receiving state, the placement approval expires and a new ICPC request shall be initiated.Placement of a Georgia Child into Receiving State Placement approval by the Georgia ICPC Administrator shall be secured before the County department proceeds with placement of the child(ren) out of state.Once the Georgia ICPC Administrator receives authorization to proceed with placement from the receiving state, the child(ren) can be placed with the approved placement resource, unless within 14 calendar days of receipt, a determination is made based on grounds specific to the report that reliance on the report will be contrary to the childs welfare. If the approved ICPC placement resource will not be used for placement, the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children Report on Childs Placement Status (ICPC Form 100B) shall be completed in Georgia SHINES and the assigned Georgia ICPC Administrator will be notified so the receiving state may be notified of the closure of the ICPC caseUpon the receiving state and Georgia ICPC office granting approval for a placement, the County DFCS and receiving state agency or facility will discuss and agree upon the logistical issues related to the placement to proceed with the following: Submission of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children Report on Childs Placement Status (ICPC Form 100B) will serve as notification to the receiving state to initiate supervision. The County DFCS shall complete an ICPC Report on Childs Placement Status in Georgia SHINES (ICPC Form 100B) confirming the date of placement and notify via email the Georgia ICPC Administrator assigned to monitor compliance with the Compact of its completion; The ICPC Report on Childs Placement Status (ICPC Form 100B) shall be completed expeditiously and forwarded to the receiving state by the Georgia ICPC Administrator within two (2) business days of notification. The approval (permission) for placement is valid for six (6) months from the date the receiving state Compact Administrator signs the ICPC request.

Legal custody of a child in foster care cannot be transferred to a family member or other entity without first securing the approval of the receiving state ICPC office and Georgia ICPC Administrator. Children subject to a Georgia Juvenile Court order of custody remain subject to the venue of that court until the child reaches the age of 18 (Exception: A finalized adoption or permanent guardianship terminates the jurisdiction of the court). Georgia DFCS maintains legal and financial responsibility for a child placed through the Compact; therefore, if at any time it is determined the placement is no longer suitable for the child due to the childs disruption or the resource no longer being capable or willing to maintain the safety and well-being of the child, upon the request of the receiving state, Georgia shall take the necessary actions to return the child to Georgia within five (5) business days.PRACTICE GUIDANCEThe assessment and approval of potential placement resources via the ICPC process is not intended for the assessment of every out of state relative or fictive kinship resource identified through the reasonably diligent search. The SSCM and supervisor shall evaluate the responses received from each relative/fictive kinship resource to determine which placement resource will offer the foster child(ren) the greatest opportunity to assure safety, well-being and permanency. Issues to consider when assessing and selecting identified resources include: Relatives should be given preference over non-relative placements unless no relative can be identified that is willing or capable of meeting the child(ren)s needs for safety, well-being and/or permanence or the child has an existing strong bond with a non-relative; Proximity to the child(ren)s parent/caregiver, whenever the permanency plan is reunification; The willingness of the placement resource to preserve the child(ren)s important connections to family, community, culture and faith; The capacity of the placement resource to meet the special needs of the child(ren) including physical, cognitive, behavioral and/or emotional needs; andThe willingness of the placement resource to work in partnership with both the sending and receiving state in the achievement of permanency.ICPC request (completed in its entirety) The ICPC request Application Packet shall include the following current information: ICPC Cover Letter: The cover letter includes the following information: The name, date of birth, race/ethnicity and sex of the child under consideration for interstate placement; The name, address, telephone number and other pertinent information for the person or entity being considered as a placement resource for the child;Statement of Case Management to the Court: a statement by the DFCS County office that the placement resource being considered in the receiving state has been pre-screened and is believed to be both willing and capable of being approved as a placement resource for the child(ren); The purpose/reason for the childs placement with the identified resource; A statement of the requestors legal authority to facilitate the placement of the child with the resource if approval is granted. Signature of SSCM, SSS and County Director/Designee Interstate Compact Placement on the Placement Report on the Childs Placement Status (ICPC Form 100B): Only required as a part of the request if the child was placed with the resource prior to securing permission from the receiving state; The names of any children previously placed with the placement resource in the sending state (if applicable); Court Order: A copy of the most recent court order reflecting that DFCS has legal custody and placement authority for the child subject to the request; Comprehensive Child and Family Assessment/Reassessment: If the request is for siblings, only one CCFA is required for the family.Medical, Dental, Mental Health, and Educational Documentation: The most recent (within one year) child-specific medical, dental and educational information.

The determination shall be child-specific; therefore a form must be submitted for each child subject to the request; Financial/Medical Plan: Statement of the sending states plan to assure responsibility for financial and medical expenses. If more than one child is subject to the request, a determination concerning the financial responsibility and resource for medical coverage shall be provided for each.The Safe and Timely Interstate Home Study Report must be completed within sixty (60) calendar days. Note that this report is not equivalent to a placement decision. Timeframe for completion of Safe and Timely Interstate Home Study ReportAs quickly as possible, but not more than sixty (60) calendar days after receiving a home study request, the receiving state shall: Directly or by contract, complete a study of the home environment for purposes of assessing the safety and suitability of the child being placed in the home. Return to the sending state a report on the results of the home study that shall address the extent to which placement in the home would meet the needs of the child. This report may or may not include a decision approving or denying permission to place the child. In the event the parts of the home study involving the education and training of the placement resource remain incomplete, the report shall reference such items by including an anticipated date of completion.Receiving state placement decision may be postponed If the receiving state cannot provide a decision regarding approval or denial of the placement at the time of the safe and timely home study report, the receiving state should provide the reason for delay and an anticipated date for a decision regarding the request. Reasons for delay may be factors such as the receiving state requiring all relatives to be licensed as a foster home. If such condition must be met before approval, a reasonable date for compliance shall be set forth in the receiving state transmittal accompanying the initial home study, if possible.Receiving state decisions to approve or deny placement resource (request) Timeframe for final decision: Final approval or denial of the placement resource request shall be provided by the receiving state Compact Administrator in the form of a signed Interstate Compact Placement on the Placement of a Children Request (100A), as soon as practical but no later than one hundred and eighty (180) calendar days from receipt of the initial home study request. This six (6) month window is to accommodate licensure and/or other receiving state requirements applicable to foster or adoption home study requests.Expedited communication of decision: If necessary or helpful to meet time requirements, the receiving state ICPC office may communicate its determination to the sending agency's state Compact Administrator by FAX or other means of facsimile transmission or electronic transmission, if acceptable to both receiving and sending state. However, this may not be done before the receiving state Compact Administrator has actually recorded the determination on the Interstate Compact Placement on the Placement of a Children Request (ICPC Form 100A). The written notice (the completed Interstate Compact Placement on the Placement of a Children Request (ICPC Form 100A)) shall be mailed, sent electronically, if acceptable, or otherwise sent promptly. The receiving state home study local agency shall not send the home study and/or recommendation directly to the sending state local agency without approval from the sending and receiving state ICPC offices. Authority of receiving state to make final decision: The authority of the receiving state is limited to the approval or denial of the placement resource. The receiving state may decline to provide a favorable determination if the receiving state Compact Administrator finds that based on the home study, the proposed caregiver would be unable to meet the individual needs of the child, including the child's safety, permanency, health, well-being, and mental, emotional and physical development.Authority of sending court/placing agency: When the receiving state has approved a placement resource, the sending court/placing agency has the final authority to determine whether to use the approved placement resource in the receiving state. The receiving state Interstate Compact Placement on the Placement of a Children Request (ICPC Form 100A) approval expires six (6) months from the date the request was signed by the receiving state.Reconsideration of Denied ICPC Assessments Georgia may request reconsideration of a denied ICPC placement within 90 calendar days of the date of receipt of the signed ICPC request from the receiving state ICPC Administrator. The basis of the reconsideration shall be: Request reconsideration without a new home study: Georgias ICPC office can request the receiving state ICPC office to reconsider the denial of placement of the child with the placement resource. If the receiving state ICPC office chooses to overturn the denial, it can be based on review of the evidence presented by Georgias ICPC office and/or any other new information deemed appropriate. If approved, a new request giving an approval without a new home study will be signed.Request new home study re-examining reasons for original denial: Georgias ICPC office may send a new ICPC home study request if the reason for denial has been corrected; i.e., move to new residence with adequate bedrooms. The receiving state ICPC office is not obligated to activate the new home study request, but it may agree to proceed with a new home study to reconsider the denial decision if it believes the reasons for denial have been corrected. This regulation shall not conflict with any appeal process otherwise available in the receiving state.The receiving state ICPC office has 60 days from the date the formal request to reconsider denial has been received from Georgias ICPC office. If the receiving state ICPC administrator decides to change the prior decision denying the placement, an ICPC transmittal letter and the new request shall be signed reflecting the new decision.FORMS AND TOOLSAssociation of Administrators of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children ICPC ArticlesAssociation of Administrators of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children  ICPC RegulationsDocumenting ICPC Cases in Georgia SHINES  Job AideICPC Cover Letter - SampleField Fiscal Services COSTAR Manual 3001: Family Foster CareStatement of Case Management/Potential Placement/Party Under ICPC Regulation 2 ",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-15-interstate-compact-placement-children-icpc-section-152

GA :: Child Welfare Policy Manual :: Chapter 15 Interstate Compact On The Placement of Children (ICPC) :: Section 15.0 Introduction To Interstate Compact On The Placement Of Children (ICPC),Georgia,Rules,"2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015","Administrative process, Definitions, Placement",,,"INTRODUCTIONChildren in the custody of the Division of Family and Children Services (DFCS) who are placed outside of Georgia shall be assured the same protection and services that would be provided if they remained in their home state. The Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC) is the best means to ensure protection and services to children who are placed across state lines. The Compact is a uniform law enacted by all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U. S. Virgin Islands establishing orderly procedures for the interstate placement of children and assigns responsibility for those involved in placing the child. Georgia legislature enacted the Compact March 23, 1977. Under the terms of the law, the state agrees to follow uniform procedures when making or accepting interstate placements of children. Since the Compact is also a contract among the member states and has been codified into law by statute, it must be interpreted and implemented uniformly by all states.The Compact accomplishes the following: Provides the sending state/agency the opportunity to obtain home studies (an evaluation of the proposed placement) prior to making a determination that the placement is in the childs best interest.Allows the prospective receiving state to ensure that the placement is not contrary to the interests of the child, and that applicable laws and policies have been followed before approval of the placement. Assures liability and responsibility for the safety of a child placed contrary to ICPC requirements (ICPC violation) rests with the sending state. Guarantees the child legal and financial protection by assuring that the sending state retains legal and financial responsibility for any child placed subject to the Compact. Provides the sending state/agency the opportunity to obtain supervision and regular reports on the childs adjustment and progress in the placement.BackgroundThe need for a Compact to regulate the interstate movement of children was recognized in the 1950s. At that time, a group of east coast social service administrators joined informally to study the problems of children moved out of state for foster care or adoption. Among the problems they identified was the failure of importation and exportation statutes enacted by individual states to provide protection for children. They recognized that a states jurisdiction ends at its borders and that a state can only compel an out-of-state agency or individual to discharge its obligations toward a child through a compact. The administrators were also concerned that a state to which a child was sent did not have to provide supportive services even though it might agree to do so on a courtesy basis. In response to these and other problems, the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children was drafted, and in 1960 New York was the first state to enact it.PRACTICE GUIDANCEIn accordance with ICPC rules and regulations the following definitions will be used when complying with ICPC requirements:ChildA person, who by reason of minority is legally subject to parental guardianship or similar control.Home StudyAn evaluation of a home environment conducted in accordance with applicable requirements of the State in which the home is located, to determine whether a proposed placement of a child would meet the individual needs of the child, including the childs safety, permanency, health, well-being, and mental, emotional, and physical development.Interstate Home StudyA home study conducted by a state at the request of another state, to facilitate an adoptive or foster care placement in the state, of a child in foster care under the responsibility of the state.Placement The arrangements for the care of a child in a family or boarding home or in a child caring agency or institution, but does not include any institution caring for the mentally ill, mentally defective or epileptic or any institution primarily educational in character, and any hospital or other medical facility. Receiving State The state to which a child is sent, brought, or caused to be sent or brought, whether by public authorities or private persons or agencies and whether for placement with private agencies or persons. Safe Timely Interstate Home Study An interstate home study report completed by a state if the state provides to the other state that requested the study, within 60 days after receipt of the request, a report on the results of the study. The preceding sentence shall not be construed to require the state to have completed, within the 60 day period, the parts of the home study involving the education and training of the prospective foster or adoptive parents. Sending Agency A member state, officer or employee thereof; a subdivision of a member state, or officer or employee thereof; a court of a member state; a person, corporation, association, charitable agency or other entity having legal authority over a child who sends, brings, or causes to be sent or brought any child to another state.VisitA social or cultural experience of short duration provided to the child, such as a stay in camp or with a friend or relative who has not assumed legal responsibility for providing child care services. The childs stay is intended to be no longer than thirty (30) days.

The term age or developmentally appropriate means Activities or items that are generally accepted as suitable for children of the same chronological age or level of maturity or that are determined to be developmentally appropriate for a child based on the development of cognitive, emotional, physical and behavioral capacities that typical for an age or age group; and In the case of a specific child, activities or items that are suitable for the child based on the developmental stages attained by the child with respect to cognitive, emotional, physical and behavioral capacities of the child. Caregivers shall apply the reasonable and prudent parenting standard when determining whether to allow a child in foster care to participate in particular extracurricular, enrichment, cultural, and social activities. This includes assessing and approving the plan of supervision for youth engaging in activities while not under the direct supervision or oversight of the caregiver. The term reasonable and prudent parenting standard means the standard characterized by careful and sensible parental decisions that maintain the health, safety and best interests of a child while at the same time encouraging the emotional and developmental growth of the child, that a caregiver shall use when determining whether to allow a child in foster care under the responsibility of the state to participate in extracurricular, enrichment, cultural and social activities. In this context, caregiver means a foster parent with whom a child in foster care has been placed or a designated official for a child caring institution (CCI) in which a child in foster care has been placed. DFCS shall ensure prospective foster and adoptive parents are adequately prepared with the appropriate knowledge and skills to provide for the needs of a child. As necessary, such preparation shall continue after placement of the child and includes knowledge and skills relating to the reasonable and prudent parenting standard for the participation of the child in age or developmentally appropriate activities, including knowledge and skills relating to the developmental stages of the cognitive, emotional, physical, and behavioral capacities of a child and applying the standard to decisions such as whether to allow the child to engage in social, extracurricular, enrichment, cultural and social activities, including sports, field trips and overnight activities lasting one or more days and involving the signing of permission slips and arranging transportation for the child to and from extracurricular enrichment and social activities. DFCS standards for family foster home and CCIs shall permit use of the reasonable and prudent parenting standard. The standards so established are applied by the State to any foster family home or CCI receiving funds under Titles IV-E or IV-B. The standards shall require, as a condition of each contract entered into by a CCI to provide foster care, the onsite presence of at least of at least one official who, with respect to any child placed at the CCI, is designated to be the caregiver who is authorized to apply the reasonable and prudent parenting standard to decisions involving the participation of the child in age or developmentally-appropriate activities, and who is provided with training in how to use and apply the reasonable and prudent parenting standard in the same manner as prospective foster parents are provided the training pursuant to paragraph 471(a)(24). The standards for family foster homes and CCIs shall include policies related to the liability of foster parents and private entities under contract by the state involving the application of the reasonable and prudent parenting standard to ensure appropriate liability for caregivers when a child participates in an approved activity and the caregiver approving the activity acts in accordance with the reasonable and prudent parenting standard.Caregivers shall keep records of a childs participation in activities and share them with the childrens Social Services Case Manager (SSCM)/CPA staff during regular contacts. Caregivers shall make reasonable and prudent parenting decisions when determining whether to allow youth 14 years of age and older to be left under their own supervision for short periods of time (e.g., an hour after school or when foster parents are attending to short-term personal matters).PROCEDURESCaregivers will:Make reasonable and prudent parenting decisions regarding the day-to-day care of children placed under their care and oversight. Ensure any substitute caregivers (i.e. babysitter) possess the necessary skills to manage the parenting and/or special needs of the children left in their care, and understand the DFCS guidelines regarding supervision, discipline, and other safety practices.Engage the youths parents regarding the type of activities in which they would like the youth to participate; when possible include the parents in the decision making.Provide or arrange transportation to support youth participation in extracurricular, social enrichment and cultural activities (e.g. clubs, sports, service organizations, etc.).Keep records of childrens needs and participation in childhood activities so this information can be easily shared with DFCS/CPA. Discuss the various activities in which children have been engaged with DFCS/CPA staff during regular communications (e.g. home visits, telephone contacts, etc.). Notify DFCS/CPA prior to the occurrence of a child in DFCS custody participating in overnight trips exceeding two nights. Receive permission from DFCS prior to a child in DFCS custody traveling outside of the State of Georgia. Notify DFCS/CPA immediately when children in DFCS custody are missing from their approved foster care placement or absent without permission.DFCS/CPA/CCI staff will: Educate caregivers to promote their understanding of the reasonable and prudent parenting standard and how to apply it to decisions regarding youth participation in extracurricular, social enrichment, cultural, and social activities.Encourage partnership parenting through caregiver engaging the youths parents regarding the types of activities in which they would like their child to participate; whenever possible include the parents in the decision making.Maintain monthly contact with each caregiver to conduct an ongoing assessment around functioning, safety, and well-being in the foster home. This will include a discussion of the opportunities each child placed in the home has been provided to engage in age or developmentally appropriate activities.Document the activities in which each child in DFCS custody is participating on a monthly basis to ensure each child is being given adequate opportunities for participation in childhood activities.Discuss with caregivers when it does not appear that children are being given the opportunity to engage in age or developmentally appropriate activities (i.e. extracurricular, enrichment, cultural, and social activities) and help caregivers find solutions to any identified barriers to participation.PRACTICE GUIDANCEReasonable and Prudent Parenting Standard This standard is characterized by careful and sensible parental decisions that maintain the health, safety, and best interests of a child while at the same time encouraging the emotional and developmental growth of the child. This standard applies to family foster homes and child caring institutions (CCIs)3 . When applying this standard, a caregiver must consider what is age or developmentally appropriate for a particular child. In other words, the caregiver must know what activities are generally accepted as suitable for children of the same chronological age or level of maturity. Since many children in foster care experience developmental delays as a result of maltreatment or early childhood trauma, caregivers must determine what is suitable for each child based upon the developmental stages attained by the child with respect to cognitive, emotional, physical, and behavioral capacities. Depending on where a particular child is developmentally, it may not be reasonable or prudent to allow him/her to participate in certain activities or he/she may require a higher level of supervision than another child of the same chronological age. In some instances, a child may lack the capacity to perform certain tasks that another child might be able to perform. Thus, knowledge of a childs individual capacities and good judgment are required to successfully apply this standard. For instance, when determining whether to allow youth 14 years of age and older to be left under their own supervision for short periods of time (e.g., an hour after school or when foster parents are attending to short-term personal matters) caregivers must ensure the youth do not have physical, mental, or emotional issues that inhibit their ability to function for a short period of time independent of a caregiver. In addition, caregivers must ensure youth are aware of procedures to be taken in case of an emergency and have access to emergency contact numbers for the caregiver and other approved contacts (e.g. relative, neighbor, or friend). As long as a caregiver or other entity under contract with DFCS acts in accordance with this standard when approving a childs participation in an age or developmentally appropriate activity, immunity from civil liability exists. Nevertheless, caregivers decisions regarding normalcy activities cannot be contrary to a pre-existing court order.Promoting Normalcy for Children in Foster CareCaregivers are responsible for making routine, day-to-day decisions regarding the ongoing care and maintenance of children placed in their home. When applying the reasonable and prudent parenting standard, the goal is to promote normalcy for children in foster care to the fullest extent possible. Participation in extracurricular and other childhood activities is important to the childs social and emotional well-being and promotes the development of valuable life skills.Exceptions to Caregiver Decision-Making Major decisions that have significant effect on the life of a child in foster care require approval from the County DFCS and/or juvenile court. Some decisions should be made in consultation with birth parent(s) as well, especially if parental rights have not been terminated. Examples of major decisions include, but are not limited to, the following: Changing a childs school, school attendance, IEP, or participation in a GED program;Changing a childs psychotropic or other prescribed medication (including initiating or stopping) or altering the administration of medication (e.g., dosage, frequency, etc.); Authorizing children to have major medical procedures;Changing a childs court-ordered visitation plan (e.g., date, location, supervision, etc.);Stopping children from visiting their siblings; Drastically altering a childs appearance (e.g., cutting and/or applying chemicals to the childs hair, body piercing, tattoos, etc.); Changing a childs religion; Allowing a child to engage in religious ceremonies (e.g., Baptism, Confirmation, etc.);Stopping a youth from participating in the DFCS Independent Living Program (ILP); Authorizing a youth to obtain a drivers license; Authorizing a youth to travel out-of-state; and/or Granting a youth approval to date.Below are examples of things that are non-negotiable and caregivers may not do: Return children to the caregiver from whom they were removed (e.g. birth parents, adoptive parents, relatives, legal guardians, etc.) without court approval; Violate the DFCS discipline policy; Violate a court order;",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-14-resource-development-section-1426-reasonable-and

Such cases will be addressed on an individual basis and will require approval of the Director of Field Operations. DFCS employees pursuing adoption of a child in DFCS custody will receive their preservice training and have their Family Evaluation completed and approved by an entity other than the DFCS agency for which they are employed (i.e., private agency, other DFCS office).DFCS employees desiring to adopt children that are or have been on their caseload must disclose all involvement they have had with the childs family to their County and Regional Director. Any possible conflicts of interest are to be discussed at the County and Regional level before making a recommendation regarding approval to the DFCS Division Director. The Regional Director and County Director must disclose potential conflicts of interest to the DFCS Division Director in order to allow the DFCS Division Director to make an informed decision regarding whether or not to approve an employees request to adopt a child for whom they have previously provided social services.PRACTICE GUIDANCEDFCS employees are restricted from serving as foster families. This restriction exists because of the potential for conflict of interest situations and serves as a protection for all parties involved. Waiver requests must include a recommendation from the County Director of the staff member involved. Waiver requests are submitted to the DFCS Division Director, with a copy to the Director of Field Operations. Only the DFCS Division Director may approve waiver requests. DFCS employees may come into contact with a lot of families during their DFCS career. Some of that contact may involve participation in agency intervention that results in a child being removed from the custody of his/her family. For a DFCS employee to later become the new family for such a child can have the appearance of impropriety. Real or imagined, such negative perceptions of the agencys work can produce conflict that detracts from the agencys mission. However, DFCS employees know firsthand the importance of a child having consistent nurturing parental figures and family life. Consequently, it is only natural for DFCS employees to want to provide a stable, permanent home for a child whose family is unable or unwilling to do so. Therefore, DFCS must take every precaution to promote transparency when it comes to personal involvement in the lives of the families it serves. This requires employees to have open and honest dialogue with their leadership about their interest in adoption. It also requires employees to have honest self-reflection about their feelings toward a childs family and their motives for adoption. To avoid the appearance of preferential treatment, prevent accusations of sabotage against co-workers, and to protect the employees privacy, the adoptive process must not be handled by the office in which the employee is employed. It must be handled by an objective party with no motive other than to find the most appropriate family for a child in need.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-14-resource-development-section-1425-staff

Caregivers currently approved with another County DFCS or CPA shall go through an abbreviated approval process with the new county or new agency. The DFCS County Director/Designee must grant approval prior to any child in foster care relocating with a caregiver to a different county. DFCS shall transfer a relocating familys file to its new county of residence within 14 business days after the family is approved by the new county. If the family moved to another state prior to finalization of an adoption, refer to policy 15.6 ICPC: Court Jurisdiction Cases and Other ICPC Issues.PROCEDURESWhen a DFCS caregiver plans to move to another county in Georgia, the RD Case Manager in the county where the family currently resides will:Confirm the familys desire to continue providing foster or adoptive services and notify any other County DFCS with children in the home so they can make appropriate plans. Notify the RD Supervisor in the new county of the familys plan and provide the new address, Georgia SHINES Resource ID number, and any other helpful information regarding the family. Request post-adoptive placement services, if applicable.Complete the appropriate Dissemination Log before transferring Criminal Records Information (CRI) regarding the foster family. (Must be signed out to a person in the receiving county who has completed Security Integrity training)Place the home on hold in the Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information System (Georgia SHINES) until the transfer is approved via the Home Approval Section of the Home Information Page.Instruct the family to notify the new county within five calendar days of their move.When a DFCS caregiver plans to move to another county in Georgia, the RD Case Manager in the new county will: Acknowledge receipt of the notification of transfer and/or request for post-adoptive placement services within five business days. NOTE: If a family moves to an adjoining county, the original county may request permission from the new county to continue to provide post-adoptive placement supervision. Complete a re-evaluation of the home as soon as the family relocates to the new county (see policy 14.13 Resource Development: Family Re-evaluation). Update the Foster Home record in Georgia SHINES to reflect the change in county, address, phone number, etc.Take the home off hold in Georgia SHINES via the Home Approval Section of the Home Information Page. Provide supervision of the foster home.When approved caregivers (DFCS or CPA) request to transfer between agencies (DFCS <> CPA <> CPA), the RD Case Manager or CPA staff will:Inform the caregiver(s) they can serve as a foster family for only one agency at a time (i.e., a County DFCS or a single CPA), discuss the re-evaluation process, and ask them to sign an Authorization for Release of Information so information may be shared between the agencies involved. Request and review the caregivers Family Evaluation from the previous agency. This includes any subsequent evaluations, pre-service training certificate, documentation of annual training hours, and history of policy violations or corrective actions. Utilize an abbreviated foster home re-evaluation process to assess the family: Determine if any components of the Family Evaluation are missing or need to be updated (e.g., medical evaluations, drug screens, etc.) and ensure all required attachments and verifications are obtained (see policy 14.10 Resource Development: Initial Family Evaluation). Conduct CPS screening and a fingerprint-based criminal records check (CRC) on all adult household members. A CPS check from other state(s) is unnecessary unless an adult household member has lived out-of-state since the homes last approval. The results of a CRC may not be transferred between agencies. Therefore, a new CRC is necessary if the caregiver is transferring between CPAs or between a CPA and DFCS. A new CRC is unnecessary if the caregiver is simply moving from one county in Georgia to another but remaining with the same agency.Conduct background screening using the following databases: Department of Corrections Offender Query; Board of Pardons and Parole; Sexual Offender Registry.Request a recommendation from the previous agency regarding the caregivers protective capacities and confirmation from the DFCS or CPA Director or Designee that the caregivers are active and in good standing. Conduct at least one family consultation. Submit the Family Evaluation for supervisory approval and final approval from the DFCS or CPA Director.Provide written notification of the approval decision to the applicantDFCS staff must upload all information received from the CPA, including the home study addendum, into External Documentation in Georgia SHINES.When children are placed in a CPA home that is transferring to another agency the RD Case Manager or CPA staff will: Delete the home from the current CPA list in Georgia SHINES. Add the home to the new CPA list. Update the home information page for the resource (i.e., non-DFCS certifying entity, capacity, etc.). Certain changes may require the home to be moved to pending approval status.Contact the Data Integrity Specialist (DIS) in the county where the case is located and ask the DIS to update the placement. The DIS will have to go into the current placement, select the resource again, and save it. At that point, the resource will show the new CPA.PRACTICE GUIDANCEApproved DFCS caregiver moves to another county DFCS staff should maintain regular contact with approved families and be aware when families have plans of moving to another county. When families have children placed in their home, transition planning must include all local DFCS involved. Each local DFCS is responsible for planning for the children in their custody. The decision whether or not to allow a child to move out of county with a family is made only after careful consideration and requires the prior approval of the County Director/Designee. The proximity of the new county, the ongoing treatment needs of the child, and the childs permanency plan are important factors to consider. Ultimately, placement decisions should be based upon what is in the best interest of the child.Family transfers between a CPA and DFCS It is incumbent upon DFCS and CPAs to ensure transferring families meet the DFCS Safety and Quality Standards (SQS). A thorough assessment of the familys current circumstances and protective capacities must be clearly documented in the re-evaluation. Please note that CPAs are not required to use IMPACT FCP for pre-service training. Certificates of pre-service training from Model Approach to Partnerships in Parenting/Group Preparation & Selection (MAPP/GPS), Parent Resources for Information, Development, and Education (PRIDE), Parents as Tender Healers (PATH), or Treatment Parent Readiness Training are acceptable.

If the face-to-face meeting is not possible, DFCS will document the reason no face-to-face meeting was conducted.PROCEDURESUpon the decision that an approved home is to be closed, the local DFCS will:Conduct a face-to-face meeting to discuss the reason(s) for closure and determine if there are special supportive services needed to assist the family in bringing closure to any unresolved issues around the removal of the children or the agencys role and responsibility. Send a letter to the family within 10 days of the face-to-face meeting describing the reasons for closure and the official closure date. The letter will include the County Directors/Designees availability to meet with them, an explanation of the grievance process, and a statement regarding whether or not the closure of the home is related to a grievable issue. Notify caregivers that closure due to substantiated child abuse and/or neglect in their home is a non-grievable issue. If requested, the County Director/Designee may meet with caregivers to afford them the opportunity to be heard.Reassess caregivers that have been inactive for a period of six months due to the request of the caregivers and provide notification (verbal and written) if the caregivers have been determined to be unable to meet the needs of children entering care. Document the home closure and required Director/Designee approval in the Contact Detail in the Georgia SHINES. Notify the State Permanency Unit when an approved adoptive home is closed. Request the foster parent(s) to complete the Foster Parent Exit Survey Provide the web address (see Forms and Tools section).Explain that the local DFCS is not involved in the exit survey process.PRACTICE GUIDANCESome caregivers will depart from DFCS due to circumstances unrelated to the foster care program. DFCS should use this opportunity to explore with the caregivers any recommendations or suggestions they are willing to share regarding the foster care program as well as other ways they may be of service to DFCS. The closure of an approved home should be carefully considered and conducted in a manner that recognizes the familys contributions to the foster care program. Whenever possible, the decision to close a home should be mutually determined by the County DFCS and the caregivers. Counties should consult their Regional Adoption Coordinator (RAC) as needed. When the recommendation for the closure of a home is received from the State Office, the County DFCS should notify the State Permanency Unit of the actual date of closure within two business days.Closing a Home following an unsubstantiated Child Protective Services (CPS) Investigation An unsubstantiated case disposition is not indicative of reported allegations being unfounded or untrue. The unsubstantiated case disposition simply indicates there was not a preponderance of evidence to support an allegation of maltreatment. Therefore, after carefully considering all known information, DFCS may still have concerns about the appropriateness of a foster home to provide care for children in DFCS custody. In accordance with DFCS Safety and Quality Standards, approved caregivers must demonstrate the maturity, stability, fitness, skills, and competency to successfully protect, nurture, and meet the developmental needs of children. When there are concerns about a caregivers ability to do so, DFCS has a responsibility to consider all known information that impacts child safety and well-being. This may result in DFCS exercising its discretion to close the foster home to ensure the ongoing safety and well-being of children in DFCS custody.Homes with a history of refusing or ejecting placements When reassessing inactive homes for closure, the assessment must include a discussion with the caregivers around their ongoing motivation and commitment, the needs of the children entering care, and the ability of the caregivers to provide care based on these needs.Waivers to allow a home to remain open When there is a policy requirement for a home to be closed, a waiver may be requested to allow the home to remain open. Such a request is usually only granted to facilitate permanency for a specific child already placed in the home. The waiver request must contain a compelling justification for the home to remain open, including the following:Documentation of the safety of children in the home;The length of time any child in DFCS custody has been in the home and the childs permanency goal; An approved CAP; and Any additional documentation from treatment providers and/or other professionals that have knowledge of the family and/or child.Waiver requests should be sent to the office of the State Foster Care Services Director via the state waiver mailbox: dfcs-waivers@dhs.ga.gov.Exit Meeting at Termination of Service Homes may be closed voluntarily at the request of the caregiver or involuntarily due to failure to meet agency expectations regarding good practice in child welfare. Caregivers are a valuable source of information for improvement of DFCS policy and service delivery to children and families. They can also help the agency strengthen its collaboration on behalf of children with community stakeholders. Consequently, when the decision is made to close a home, the DFCS County Director/Designee will: Send a letter to the caregiver within 10 days of the closure indicating the reasons for closure and the effective date; Indicate in the closure letter, the desire to conduct an exit meeting with the family at a scheduled date and time; and Address the following areas in the exit meeting with the family: The appreciation DFCS has for the familys contribution as a member of the foster care team; The DFCS role as mandated protector of children in foster care; The primary reason the family decided to discontinue foster, if applicable; What, if anything, DFCS might have done differently that would have prevented the foster home closure;Description of the familys overall experience with DFCS; and Recommendations or suggestions for improvement the family may be willing to share.FORMS AND TOOLSFoster Parent Exit Interview",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-14-resource-development-section-1423-home-closure

Discontinue utilizing the home as a placement resource for children in DFCS custody and relocate the children if: a. There is an identified threat to the safety of a child; b. The family has committed a second policy violation; and/or c. The family is not amenable to change, correction, or corrective intervention (i.e., refuses to cooperate with the assessment process or refuses to sign a CAP). Document the completion date of the CAP within 72 hours of receipt of the information from the CPA/CCI. For CCIs, document all Standards violations and any corresponding CAP. Decide whether a CPA/CCI foster family may be removed from hold status. Notify the appropriate DFCS staff (SSCM, SSS, etc.) when the PV assessment is complete and available for review.PRACTICE GUIDANCEWhat are Policy Violations?Policy Violations are actions performed by an approved caregiver (DFCS or CPA Family Foster Home, Foster Care Kinship Placement, or CCI), that may breach any DFCS Safety and Quality Standard, Foster Parent Manual, RBWO Minimum Standards or other DFCS policy, but do not constitute child abuse. Violations generally fall into one of the categories below: Actions that pose an immediate or potential threat to the safety or well-being of the child in care. These may include, but are not limited to, inappropriate disciplinary measures (both physical/corporal and emotional), violations of supervision, or any other safety requirements.Actions that do not pose a direct or immediate risk to the safety and well-being of the child. These may include the following or similar infractions: Failure to complete required hours of annual Continued Parent Development (CPD);Inappropriate utilization of an approved home (see policy 14.1 Resource Development: Safety and Quality Standards); Failure to cooperate with or assume a partnership role with the agency in meeting the needs of the child; Inappropriate disclosure of confidential information regarding the child; Inappropriate use of acceptable disciplinary practices (e.g., extended periods of time out, etc.); and Inappropriate assignment of chores or work responsibilities.Tips for Preparing to Conduct a Policy Violation AssessmentReview prior history of policy violations or CPS complaints regarding the caregiver. Review the childs history in order to gain a thorough understanding of the childs needs and the caregiver capacity necessary to meet those needs. Review the initial family evaluation on the foster home to confirm that the type of children placed in the home match what the caregivers indicated on the Caregiver Placement Preferences. Review the Kinship Assessment on a foster care kinship placement that is not an approved foster home. Determine if assistance is needed from the Permanency or Adoption Case Manager to interview the children. Determine if any of the children have special needs that will impact the interview process (e.g. speech impairment, etc.). Determine the need for interpretation services for non-English speaking individuals or auxiliary aids for sensory impaired individuals (see policy 1.5 Administration: Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)/Section 504 and Reasonable Modifications). Determine if the concerns that are reported call for the child to be interviewed away from the home.Conflicts of Interest in Policy Violation AssessmentsTo avoid conflicts of interest a PV assessment could be conducted by an SSCM and SSS without primary case management responsibilities or from outside the county in which the home or resource is located. It is permissible for the County Department where the resource or home is located or with primary case management responsibilities to initiate the PV assessment to ensure child safety when a SSCM from the other County Department is not readily available.Policy Violations May Lead to Closure of a Foster Home While generally less severe than an allegation of child abuse, a policy violation may be sufficient grounds for closing a foster home or may require other action. Unless policy requires a home to be closed, the County Director should consider the following factors in determining whether or not to allow an approved DFCS foster home to remain open: Severity of the incident;Parenting practices demonstrated by the caregivers; Prior placement disruptions experienced by the foster parent or child; Willingness of the caregivers to embrace alternative approaches to correct the problem or change the undesirable behavior (e.g., training or counseling);Quality of the relationship between the caregivers and the child in care; andCaregivers demonstration of increased protective capacity as a result of satisfactory completion of a CAP. NOTE: These factors should also be considered when implementing a CAP with the family.Corrective Action Plan (CAP) The purpose of a CAP is to support caregivers in the development and utilization of acceptable methods of meeting the needs of children in care and to clarify the agency and the caregivers role in preventing further policy violations, thus ensuring the safety and well-being of the child in the home. The CAP serves as a supportive rather than a punitive intervention. It is implemented following a PV that has been supported and must: Identify the issues to be addressed;Set forth the steps for taking corrective action;Identify any assistance or resources that will be utilized to complete the action steps; and Specify dates for completing each step. All steps are to be completed no later than six months from the date the CAP is approved.After working with the family to define problems as difficult situations in everyday life, the RD or SSCM utilizes the CAP as a tool to build a partnership for change with the caregivers. RD Case Managers are primarily responsible for monitoring CAPs in DFCS Foster Homes. Permanency Case Managers are primarily responsible for reporting compliance with CAPS in DFCS family foster homes as well as managing CAPS involving foster care kinship caregivers who are not approved foster homes. CPA staff is responsible for monitoring CAPS in CPA Foster Homes. OPM staff is primarily responsible for monitoring CAPS in CCIs. Results should be measurable, tangible, time-limited, and documented in Georgia SHINES. The plan may be adjusted if needed but should be completed within six months. IMPACT modules may be used as a part of the CAP. CAPs are mutually developed with the involvement of the foster parent(s), kinship caregivers, licensing/approving authority, and DFCS staff responsible for the children residing in the placement resource. Other parties (e.g., child service providers, etc.) may also participate in the development of a CAP. The CAP should be signed by the applicable agency monitor (i.e., RD/Permanency Case Manager, CPA staff, or OPM staff) and both caregivers (if applicable). The CAP must be approved and signed by the applicable agency director or designee (i.e., DFCS County Director, CPA Director, or OPM Director) to ensure that liability and safety issues have been adequately addressed. The caregivers and DFCS staff responsible for the children placed in the home should always be given a copy of the CAP. Unannounced visits may be required as a component of a CAP. The CAP is not used as a safety plan for foster parents. If the safety of children in a home is an issue, action should be taken to expedite their removal and consideration given to closure of the foster home.Residential Child Care (RCC) RCC is part of the Office of the Inspector General.

Allow the CPS investigator to communicate the special investigation outcome to the caregivers. Initiate a policy violation assessment when the CPS Investigator identifies potential policy violations that were not assessed during the investigation in accordance with policy 14.22 Resource Development: Policy Violations. Notify CRRU when there is a recommendation to close a DFCS foster/adoptive home or kinship foster home based on a violation of DFCS policy.The RD Supervisor will: Immediately review the allegations of the Intake Assessment with the RD Case Manager to discuss potential impact on any current placements. Verify the DFCS foster or adoptive home was placed on hold in Georgia SHINES pending the outcome of the investigation. Ensure RD staff remains available and responsive to the CPS investigator without compromising the investigative process. Ensure no annual re-evaluation is approved on a placement resource that is the subject of an active CPS investigation. Participate in the multi-disciplinary staffing held at least 48-hours prior to the special investigation being submitted for closure (see policy 6.8 Special Investigations: Making a Special Investigation Determination). Carefully consider the history of the placement provider and the findings of the current special investigation to make decisions regarding the future status of the placement provider (e.g. whether a separate policy violation assessment needed, whether the placement resource should remain open).PRACTICE GUIDANCEMaintain Neutrality During the Investigation ProcessRD Case Managers should be careful not to interfere with a CPS investigation and should Page 3 of 3 Actions During Special Investigations maintain neutrality throughout the investigative process. This includes not sharing information pertaining to the investigation with caregivers. The CPS investigator will communicate the appropriate information to the caregivers at the appropriate time. RD staff may arrange services required to preserve the current placement(s) in the foster/adoptive home but may not serve in the role of an advocate. Foster and adoptive parents may obtain such advocacy via the Adoptive and Foster Parent Association of Georgia (AFPAG). Foster and adoptive parents are provided with a Notification of Rights brochure at the initial CPS investigation meeting, which informs them of their right to an advocate and instructions on requesting an advocate. Foster or adoptive parents may authorize an AFPAG advocate to be present for all portions of investigations of child abuse at which an accused foster or adoptive parent is present. However, CPS investigations including applicable response timeframes are not impacted by the presence or absence of advocates.FORMS AND TOOLSAdoption and Foster Parent Association of Georgia",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-14-resource-development-section-1421-actions-during

This includes name-calling, criticism, or deprecation of a childs racial/ethnic heritage and socio-economic station in life.PROCEDURESThe Resource Development (RD) and/or Social Services Case Manager (SSCM) and CPAs will: Ensure all approved caregivers have a copy of the Caregiver Child Safety Agreement and adhere to the agencys discipline policy. Share any known behavior issues the child may have with the caregivers and any behavior management techniques that have been successful with the child in the past. Respond promptly to concerns expressed by caregivers regarding managing the behavior of a child placed in their home/facility, and identify appropriate resources to assist in the implementation of effective discipline techniques. Recognize high stress factors within the placement setting home and offer appropriate services to help maintain a safe, nurturing environment. Provide school principals written notification of the identity of a child in foster care, including a statement that corporal punishment is prohibited as a means of discipline or correction. This (confidential) statement is provided at the time of enrollment. NOTE: School administrators should be reminded to keep all matters pertaining to the child confidential.PRACTICE GUIDANCEDiscipline and PunishmentThe 1989 U.S. District Consent Decree, Taylor vs. Ledbetter, guides the DFCS Discipline Policy. The Decree provides that any physical/corporal or emotional punishment to a child in foster care is prohibited. Physical/corporal punishment is defined as the deliberate infliction of pain to the body of the individual. Emotional punishment involves deliberate actions toward a child that produce, hurt, fear, anxiety and any other negative emotions in a child. The Department acknowledges that parenting is extremely challenging. The responsibilities of caring for children in agency custody are great and require an understanding of each child's needs. Caregivers are required to know the difference between discipline and punishment. Disciplinary approaches should be based on the childs age and particular needs as well as the circumstances. It is more important to use positive reinforcement than punishment to manage behavior.Discipline establishes a standard of behavior. It is training that seeks to produce a specific character or pattern of behavior. It should be a constructive process that helps a child learn to control his/her own behavior (self-discipline). On the other hand, punishment focuses on controlling behavior through use of coercive means (i.e., force, dominance, harsh penalties). Caregivers may have used some forms of physical/corporal and emotional punishment with their own children. However, it is necessary to remember that children reared in a nurturing family where their needs are consistently met may be able to tolerate punishment in a different way than children removed from their families where they experienced severe abuse and neglect. Children entering foster care usually feel at least one and often all of the following: Negative attention is better than no attention; The natural response to frustration, disappointment, anger, etc. is violence or verbal abuse; Any form of physical action by a caretaker may lead to severe abuse, creating fear and mistrust; They are not loveable, which is reinforced by physical/corporal punishment and verbal demeaning; and/or They are the reason their family is not together and deserve punishment.Discipline within the School System As an agency charged with the well-being of children, DFCS has a responsibility to advocate for the adoption of policies which are in the best interest of children who have been traumatized due to acts of neglect and abuse. Therefore, DFCS staff should advocate with school systems for the abolition of corporal punishment as a method of disciplining children in care. Some schools, in keeping with state laws relating to this issue, may require a statement from a licensed medical doctor stating that corporal punishment is detrimental to a childs mental or emotional stability.Application of the DFCS Discipline Policy The DFCS Discipline Policy applies to all children in DFCS custody regardless of placement type.FORMS AND TOOLSFoster Parent Manual",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-14-resource-development-section-1420-discipline-and
GA :: Child Welfare Policy Manual :: Chapter 14 Resource Development :: Section 14.18 Supervision Of Children,Georgia,Rules,"2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017","Administrative process, Other, Reporting requirements",,,"The Division of Family and Children Services (DFCS) shall: Ensure caregivers provide safe and appropriate supervision for each child in DFCS custody that has been placed under their care and oversight. Allow caregivers to apply the reasonable and prudent parenting standard as outlined in policy 14.26 Resource Development: Reasonable and Prudent Parenting Standard when allowing children in foster care to participate in extracurricular, enrichment, cultural, and social activities. Caregivers shall make reasonable and prudent decisions in assessing the appropriateness of the activities and approving the plan of supervision before youth participate in activities during which the youth will not be under the direct supervision or oversight of their approved foster care provider, DFCS staff, or DFCS authorized provider. Caregivers must be reasonably assured that any substitute caregivers possess the necessary skills to manage the parenting and/or special needs of the children left in their care and that the substitute caregivers will follow DFCS guidelines regarding supervision, discipline, and other safety practices. Conduct safety screenings and a state criminal history check (GCIC) on substitute caregivers providing routine care (more than once a week, usually at designated times). Require children in DFCS custody to be supervised by an adult (at least 18 years of age) at all times, this includes substitute caregivers (i.e. babysitters). EXCEPTION: Caregivers can make reasonable and prudent parenting decisions when determining whether to allow youth 14 years of age and older to be left unsupervised for short periods of time (e.g., an hour after school or when foster parents are attending to short-term matters). Provide paid respite care as a support service for caregivers who need time away from their parenting responsibilities. Caregivers may receive 10 calendar days per fiscal year (taken individually or consecutively). Overnight respite may only be provided by an approved foster parent. Foster homes providing respite must continue to meet all DFCS safety and quality standards, including standards related to appropriate utilization of a foster home. Foster homes providing respite may not exceed their approved capacity without a waiver from the applicable DFCS County Director or CPA Director.Require caregivers to notify DFCS when children placed under their care and oversight are absent without permission or run away (see policies 10.25 Foster Care: Youth Absent Without Permission and 19.22 Case Management: Missing Children). Require caregivers to report any of the following to the County DFCS immediately but no later than 24 hours of the occurrence: Any change of address; Serious illness impacting a child placed in their home (e.g. flu, serious infections); Injuries sustained by a child placed in their home (e.g. burns, cuts, bruises, fractures); Accidents involving any child placed in their home (e.g. auto, bicycle, fall). e. Change in household composition (e.g. gain or loss of household members).PROCEDURESWhen it becomes necessary to utilize substitute caregivers, the approved DFCS caregiver or Child Placing Agency (CPA) family will: Provide or arrange for care and supervision appropriate to the childs age, level of development, and individual needs. Leave no child in DFCS custody under the supervision and care of a minor.The County DFCS office or CPA will: Maintain open communication with approved caregivers regarding the use of substitute caregivers and respite. Explain the reasonable and prudent parenting standard to all approved caregivers and the safety concerns related to improper or inadequate supervision of children placed in their homes (see policy 14.26 Resource Development: Reasonable and Prudent Parenting Standard).Complete the appropriate safety screenings on substitute caregivers who provide routine care (see policy 19.9 Case Management: Safety Screenings). Request a state criminal history records (GCIC) on substitute caregivers who provide routine care for children in DFCS custody as outlined in policy 19.8 Case Management: Criminal Records Checks (CRC). Ensure the Child Safety Agreement and Unreimbursed Substitute In-Home/Out-of Home Caregivers forms are completed and uploaded into External Documentation in Georgia SHINES. Make a report to the Child Protective Services Intake Communication Center (CICC) when there are identified safety threats to a child as a result of improper or inadequate supervision (see policy 14.21 Resource Development: Actions During Special Investigations).Implement a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) when there are concerns regarding the level of supervision in foster homes, but the concerns do not rise to a level that requires children to be moved (see policy 14.22 Resource Development: Policy Violations).PRACTICE GUIDANCEDue to their unique needs, children in foster care placement require the ongoing care and supervision of caregivers who have undergone preparation and training adequate to meet their needs. Inherent in the process of ""becoming"" a caregiver is the understanding of the impact this experience will have on the life of the child and of the caregivers family. Nevertheless, there will be times when foster parents may need a substitute caregiver (i.e., babysitter) to supervise the children in their absence. Foster parents as well as DFCS must be reasonably assured that any substitute caregiver the foster parent decides to use possesses the necessary skills to manage the parenting needs of the child left in their care. Foster parents are not reimbursed for the expenses they incur for babysitters. Routine unreimbursed caregivers are to complete the Unreimbursed Substitute In-Home/Out-of-Home Caregivers form indicating their agreement to follow supervision, safety, and discipline standards as outlined in the Caregiver Child Safety Agreement and as instructed by the foster parent. The completion of the Unreimbursed Substitute In-Home/Out-of-Home Caregivers form also serves as confirmation that DFCS completed the appropriate safety screening on the substitute caregiver.Safe SupervisionThe Child Protective Services (CPS) standards regarding the supervision of children in the homes of their parents are not applicable to children in foster care placement. Standards of care for children in foster care are more stringent due to the uniqueness of their situation, past experiences, and the need to ensure their safety in out-of-home placements.Supervision of Older YouthGenerally speaking, reliable and competent youth, 14 years and older, may be left under their own supervision under certain circumstances and for short periods of time so as not to jeopardize their safety and well-being. At this stage in their lives, many youth are able to benefit from experiences that foster a sense of responsibility, independence, and self-control. The primary factor to consider in determining if youth may be left alone is their level of maturity and ability to function in a safe, responsible manner for short periods of time without a caregiver present. Some factors that should be considered include the following: Length of time the youth has been in the placement setting; Youths judgment and level of maturity or development; Youths demonstration of dependability, responsibility, and trustworthiness; Youths history of emotional/psychological stability; Whether the youth has a history of running away and other status offenses; Whether the youth has a history of delinquent behavior; Youths history of alcohol or other substance abuse; Number of youth present in the home, gender, and their relationship with each other;Whether the youth has a history of sexual acting out; Youths school performance;Safety of the home environment (firearm safety, water safety, any other potential hazards, etc.); and Youth's ability to readily access their foster parent or other identified person should the need arise.Respite CareRespite for Family Foster Homes is a support service designed to allow foster parents time away from their parenting responsibilities. Children in DFCS approved foster homes and CPA foster homes are eligible for this service. It is designed to give foster parents a needed break from parenting for such purposes as vacation, hospitalization, or any other circumstance that makes the foster parent unable to provide for the child's care in the home. Respite is paid at the child's current per diem rate, not to exceed 10 calendar days per fiscal year (taken individually or consecutively). When determining the number of respite days to be applied, there should be a negotiation with the foster parent to clearly establish how the days will be counted. The rule of thumb is that if a child sleeps at the respite home, it counts as a respite day (AKA head in the bed rule). Circumstances may vary, so it is important for DFCS to negotiate the number of respite days to be applied with each foster parent involved. This will help prevent conflict between any of the parties after respite services have been provided. Training for foster parents fall under current per diem not respite. When a foster parent's attendance at an approved conference is overnight or extended care is needed, the foster parents respite balance is not impacted. See Fiscal Field Services Manual Costar Section 3001 Family Foster Care Programs. Consult with the office of the Placement and Permanency Services Director as needed regarding these situations.Respite between County DFCS Homes and CPA Homes Use of family foster homes between CPAs or between CPA and DFCS family foster homes are permissible, but it should be done in consultation with the DFCS Placement and Permanency Services Director who will be able to assist with troubleshooting payment or Residential Child Care (RCC) rules.FORMS AND TOOLSCaregiver Child Safety AgreementCaregiver Child Safety Agreement - SpanishUnreimbursed Routine Substitute In-Home/Out-of-Home CaregiversUnreimbursed Routine Substitute In-Home/Out-of-Home Caregivers - Instructions",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-14-resource-development-section-1418-supervision

Include a summary written by the foster parents providing a perspective of why they are not satisfied with the decision of the Board. PRACTICE GUIDANCE The Foster Parent Bill of Rights became law on July 1, 2004 and outlines 23 rights for DFCS foster parents. The law covers issues such as non-discrimination, distribution and disclosure of information, financial reimbursement, and the right to have input into case planning for children. It includes a provision for advocates who can provide support to foster parents during child protective services investigations or through the grievance process. The Bill of Rights also allows for foster parents to file grievances when they believe that any of these rights have been violated. Care should always be taken to mention only case situations, not case names. The Foster Parent Bill of Rights may be viewed at the Adoptive and Foster Parent Association of Georgia (AFPAG) website. Besides partnering with DFCS and Foster Care Team members, there are two major organizations that provide support to Foster and Adoptive parents in the state of Georgia.

This includes activities such as clubs, school and community sports, school field trips, youth group activities, service organizations, birthday parties, sleepovers, outings with peers, drivers education, in-state vacations with the caregivers family or other families, summer and school break camps. DFCS and/or the supervising agency approval are not required for decisions made by the caregiver regarding a childs participation in childhood activities.Caregivers shall ensure that safe, responsible, appropriate supervision is provided for each child in their care. Caregivers shall make reasonable and prudent decisions in assessing and approving such activities and the plan of supervision before the childs participation in activities during which the youth will not be under the direct supervision or oversight of their approved foster care provider, DFCS staff, or DFCS authorized provider. DFCS and Child Placing Agencies (CPA) must be informed prior to the occurrence of overnight activities exceeding two nights.Caregivers shall keep records on childrens needs, activities, and significant decisions to share with DFCS/CPA during regular visits.Caregivers shall not be subject to actions against their approval status for harm caused to a child in care who participates in an activity approved by the caregiver, provided that the caregiver has acted as a reasonable and prudent parent.DFCS and the juvenile court must approve out-of-state and out-of-country travel. DFCS shall maintain monthly contact, either face-to-face, by telephone, email, or other means, with each caregiver to conduct an ongoing assessment around functioning, safety, and wellbeing in the foster home, including:Separate quality time with each foster parent; Separate quality time with each child placed in the foster home; Quality engagement with all other adult household members and children living in the home (either individually or in a group) to discuss family functioning, roles and responsibilities of household members and the childrens SSCM, how fostering has impacted them as a family, their likes/dislikes, and any needs they may have; Observation of family interactions; and Review of caregiver records and discussion of each childs involvement in age or developmentally appropriate activities.DFCS shall conduct quarterly home visits to include: Separate quality time with each foster parent; Separate quality time with each child placed in the foster home; Quality engagement with all other adult household members and children living in the home (either individually or in a group) to discuss family functioning, roles and responsibilities of household members and the childrens SSCM, how fostering has impacted them as a family, their likes/dislikes, and any needs they may have; Observation of family interactions; and Review of caregiver records and discussion of each childs involvement in age or developmentally appropriate activities.DFCS shall complete annual re-evaluations, allowing for individual quality time with all adults and children residing in the home. DFCS shall document the observation and/or engagement of each family member during home visits in the Foster Adoptive (FAD) stage under the Contacts/Summaries tab in the Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information System (Georgia SHINES). DFCS shall recognize the initial child placement in a newly approved home as being a critical time for the caregiver and provide additional support. DFCS shall provide approved caregivers a procedure for contacting the SSCM or other DFCS staff when an emergency arises in their home. DFCS shall conduct an exit meeting with approved caregivers when the caregivers home is voluntarily or involuntarily closed.PROCEDURESWhen performing case management duties, the SSCM will: Provide the caregivers with as much information as is available about children being placed in their home, including medical and educational information as well as a copy of the Family Plan and Written Transitional Living Plan (WTLP), if applicable.Keep the caregivers informed of plans for the children and of birth family information that affects the children placed in their home.Provide the caregivers with procedures for Agency contact (DFCS and other agency staff) should emergencies arise in the foster home. Discuss a plan with the caregivers for handling emergency situations (i.e., contacting 911, seeking emergency medical services, etc.). Give the caregivers timely written notice of periodic reviews or hearings to be held in regard to children in their home. Caregivers may attend reviews and hearings and share information regarding the children (see policy 17.8 Legal: Caregiver Right to Be Notified or Heard). Discuss the caregivers application of the reasonable and prudent parenting standard when determining whether to allow children in foster care to participate in extracurricular, enrichment, cultural, and social activities; and that children in the care of the caregiver are given opportunities to engage in age or developmentally appropriate activities. Encourage partnership parenting between foster parents and birth parents when it is appropriate and safe. This includes discussing with the caregiver the input of the childs parent as to the types of activities they would like their child to participate in. Whenever possible, include the birth parents in the decision making.When making decisions regarding the selection and use of an approved home, the Resource Development (RD) Case Manager will: Make a mutual decision with the RD supervisor and the caregiver regarding the suitability of a placement. Select a placement for a child by matching the characteristics and needs of the child with the strengths and protective capacities of the caregiver. Discuss the childs behavior and possible reactions to placement with the caregiver. Discuss the permanency plan for the child and expectations surrounding visitation with the birth family. Provide the caregiver with as much information available about the child being considered for placement.When making the initial placement in a newly approved home, the RD Case Manager and the SSCM will: Provide additional support to the caregivers. Provide answers to frequently asked questions. Maintain frequent contact as the caregivers settle into their role.County DFCS will: Provide all approved caregivers with telephone numbers for contacting the SSCM or other DFCS staff when an emergency occurs during or after regular office hours. Respond immediately or as indicated by agency protocol. Emergency situations include, but are not limited to, the following: The child leaves the home without permission or runs away; The child becomes seriously ill or is seriously injured and requires immediate medical attention; NOTE: Caregivers are instructed to take the child to the emergency room if the childs regular physician cannot be reached for advice. DFCS or a birth parent, if applicable, will need to complete any authorization or consent forms.The child gets into serious trouble with school, law enforcement, etc.; The childs birth parent(s), relative, or other unauthorized person attempts to remove the child from the foster home; There is a serious illness or significant change in the foster home; and/or The child is victimized or abused in any way (e.g., physically, sexually, etc.).Social Services Supervisors (SSS) will: Ensure children in care are given opportunities to engage in age or developmentally appropriate activities. During monthly staffings, discuss the visits with the SSCM and RD Case Manager to ensure quality observation and engagement is occurring at each visit. Review documentation in the Contact Detail to ensure documentation supports what occurred during visits and includes the description of the types of activities in which children are engaged. Provide coaching to the SSCM and RD Case Manager, as needed, regarding conducting and documenting a quality visit.PRACTICE GUIDANCEThe foster family has the most contact with children in care and can offer valuable information about the childrens needs and behaviors. As a member of the foster care team, foster parents make an important contribution to the Agencys goals. Partnership Parent Birth parents may be allowed to have parent-child visitation in the home of the caregivers. Caregivers often have life experiences, parenting knowledge, and skills that may benefit birth parents. Caregivers should be encouraged to share these with birth parents to assist them in meeting the needs of their children in the future. In some instances, caregivers could serve as a resource to the birth family after reunification, helping to ensure the safety and well-being of the children. Purposeful Contacts Although it may not always be possible, face-to-face contact is the preferred method for making contacts. Case Managers should make both announced and unannounced visits. Face-to-face interaction allows one to engage people on a more intimate level. It also allows one to observe body language and how others respond to certain questions or statements. It helps Case Managers discern when there are challenges in our relationship with caregivers. Below are some of the topics that should be discussed during contacts with the caregivers:Health and safety issues; Behavioral issues; Educational issues; Ongoing opportunities children have had to engage in age or developmental appropriate activities; Needed supports, training, or services;Changes within the foster home (i.e., household members, health, etc.); Progress toward goals of the Family Plan; Childrens permanency plans; andCaregiver issues or concerns.All contacts should be documented in Georgia SHINES, including any significant issues or concerns regarding the children or the quality of care being provided by the caregivers. Some key principles around good practice to keep in mind when assessing the functioning of approved caregivers include:Recognizing the family providing care as a system: Each member of the family, including the child in foster care, has a role and responsibilities within the family. If any one person is unable to fulfill their responsibilities, then the whole family is impacted. Engagement and relationship-building: Purposeful visits are not only about engaging and building a relationship with the child in foster care, but also about engaging and building a relationship with the family who is caring for the child. Involvement of families and youth: Because each member of a family has a role and responsibilities, it is essential to obtain input from all family members when assessing family functioning. When family members are engaged, it will reaffirm their importance in ensuring the success of the family system. Recognizing all children are individuals: Any child (whether biological, adopted, or in foster care) residing in the home will adjust differently to the changing circumstances associated with foster care. It is important to recognize the individuality of each child and the impact foster care has on their lives. Cultural awareness: Each family has its own culture. Therefore, when a child in foster care enters a pre-existing family, his/her culture is merging with another culture. Culture impacts family rituals and traditions. As family functioning is assessed, we must be respectful of all cultures involved and how they impact the functioning of the family. Empathy, authenticity, and transparency: During any contact with children in foster care or those family members in the home where they reside, we should be mindful of these three words: empathy, authenticity, and transparency. When engaging children in foster care, their caregivers, and anyone else in the home, we must be able to identify with their thoughts and feelings, even though we may not always agree. We also must be genuine and open in our communication with all family members and recognize that we have some accountability regarding the success or failure of each foster care placement. Purposeful visits are also a time for caregivers to hold us accountable for what we may or may not be doing on behalf of the child in care and/or on behalf of their family who has partnered with us. Remaining focused on safety, permanency, and well-being throughout the process.Selection of a Home Placement decisions should be based on the best interest of the child and the potential of the caregivers to work with the Agency and the birth parent. The Agency must also consider the location of the home in relation to the childs family home, school, and other community connections. Initial Placement The caregivers relationship with DFCS and his/her perception of being supported by DFCS are strongly influenced by the initial placement experience. The transition from pre-service training to in-service situations can be a nervous and unsettling experience for caregivers. A recently approved family needs more frequent contacts by the RD and SSCM to help them adjust to the initial placement. The caregivers should be encouraged to communicate openly about their foster parent experience and the effects on the foster family. The caregivers may have questions or need clarification about information previously discussed during IMPACT Family Centered Practice training. This is also a good time to help the caregivers take advantage of ongoing training. In-service training should be initiated within 60 days of the home approval date to assist with continuing development and group support. Emergencies in Foster Homes Caregivers should always have an updated listing of contact numbers for SSCMs and county leadership. There should never be an emergency situation involving a child in DFCS custody in which the caregivers are unable to contact anyone at the County DFCS. The County DFCS should designate someone to be responsible for updating and distributing the contact list to ensure caregivers always have the most current and accurate contact information. Some find it helpful to distribute contact lists at caregiver meetings or circulate them with monthly newsletters.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-14-resource-development-section-1416-working

It also affects the states ability to receive financial reimbursement from the federal government for the cost of providing services to IV-E eligible children. In addition, changes in a caregivers approval status can affect the caregivers ability to serve as an adoptive resource for a child. Therefore, it is extremely important that the approval status of placement resources be correctly entered and maintained in Georgia SHINES and that any changes in a caregivers approval status be reported immediately. In many cases, the Case Manager making routine visits in the home is the first to become aware of conditions or circumstances that could affect a caregivers approval status and should immediately report such conditions or circumstances to a member of the Resource Development (RD) team.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-14-resource-development-section-1415-household

Significant changes may include events such as the following: Change of address; Change in marital status or relational issues; Change in household composition (e.g. births, deaths, household members moving in or out); Change in employment or financial status;Change in approved capacity; Change in desired placement preferences; Changes that result in new requirements for safety (e.g., pool, firearm, pets); and A household member reaches 18 years of age. NOTE: A criminal records check, safety screening and a medical evaluation must be completed on new adult household members and existing household members reaching 18 years of age. Use the date of the final approving authoritys signature as the approval date of a Family Evaluation Addendum. The DFCS Director or Child Placing Agency (CPA) Director/Designee serves as the final approving authority.PROCEDURESThe Resource Development Case manager will: Consult with the Resource Development Supervisor to determine if a change in a placement resources household or personal circumstances can be adequately addressed with an addendum to the most recent Family Evaluation or if a Family Reevaluation is warranted.Confirm and document that new household members or current household members reaching the age of 18 have completed all applicable requirements within 30 calendar days of the qualifying event. This includes any applicable medical evaluation, safety screening and criminal records check (see policies 14.10 Resource Development: Initial Family Evaluation, 19.9 Case Management: Safety Screenings and 19.8 Case Management: Criminal Records Checks). Obtain verification of changes in a placement providers circumstances (e.g. copy of marriage license, divorce decree, etc.) to support verbal reports from caregivers. Document any changes/updates regarding a home under the FA Home tab in Georgia SHINES within 72 hours of the information becoming known to the agency: Complete the written addendum and obtain approval within 30 calendar days.RD Supervisors will: Provide guidance to the case manager on whether to complete a Family Evaluation Addendum or a Family Re-evaluation; Review the addendum for approval and determine if caregivers need supportive services as a result of their change in circumstances;Submit the Family Evaluation Addendum to the final approval authority.PRACTICE GUIDANCEA team approach is necessary to ensure that DFCS and CPAs maintain the most current information regarding placement resources. For children in foster homes, CPAs work with a Resource Maintainer in the Office of Provider Management (OPM). For adoptive homes, the CPAs work with a Resource Maintainer in the State Permanency Unit. There is no template for an addendum, but it involves more than just writing a new address, telephone number, etc. Staff should confirm that the caregiver will continue to be appropriate to meet the needs of children following the change that has occurred in his/her circumstances. For instance, if there is a change in the household composition, the addendum should reflect how the change will impact any child placed in the home. Some changes are more complex than others and may have a more profound effect on family dynamics. Therefore, resource development staff must exercise keen judgment when determining whether a Family Evaluation Addendum is the best approach to address a change. An addendum may seem like the simplest approach to update some basic information on a family. However, staff must use discernment to recognize when it is more appropriate to complete a Family Re-evaluation to document a thorough assessment of the impact that a change has on a family and the quality of care provided to children placed in the home. Local staff should not hesitate to consult with their regional support networks or the State Permanency section for assistance as needed. Always verify reported or suspected changes in a caregivers circumstances. The old adage trust but verify is a good rule of thumb. Experience has shown that sometimes things are reported to have occurred before they have actually or legally occurred. For instance, caregivers may report that they are no longer married. However, caregivers are still legally married until either a final divorce decree or death certificate from the appropriate government entity officially changes their marital status.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-14-resource-development-section-1414-family

No home shall have more than 12 months of approval (e.g., the re-evaluation for a foster home approved 01/10/2019 is due by 12/31/2019). ii. If a re-evaluation is completed within 30 calendar days of the due date, then the approval term (starting month to ending month) and re-evaluation date will remain the same as it was previously. iii. If the re-evaluation is completed more than 30 calendar days early or late, then the approval term and re-evaluation date must change. All components of the re-evaluation must follow the Structured Analysis Family Evaluation (SAFE) model (see Practice Guidance: Updating a SAFE Home Study). The re-evaluation must be completed by a home study practitioner (HSP) who is certified in the SAFE model. The HSP may be a certified DFCS staff member, Child Placing Agency (CPA) staff member or approved contractor. The re-evaluation process must be supervised throughout by a supervisor who is certified in the SAFE model and has successfully completed the SAFE Supervisor Training. All home study interviews must be conducted in the applicants home. Each household member must be interviewed. Obtain input from children not currently placed in the home but were household members at some point during the previous approval period, when practical and appropriate. The final approval authority must be a SAFE certified DFCS County Director/Designee or CPA Director/Designee. The date the re-evaluation is signed by the final approving authority is the official date of approval for the re-evaluation. If the re-evaluation is not approved timely, the foster home status must be changed from full approval status in Georgia SHINES accordingly (see policy 14.15 Resource Development: Household Approval Status).Afford qualified individuals with disabilities an equal opportunity to participate in and benefit from the DFCS foster care and adoption programs (see policy 14.11 Resource Development: Individualized Assessment). Perform applicable safety screening of all adult household members each year before granting final approval. Screening must be conducted within 90 calendar days prior to the re-evaluation due date (see policy 19.9 Case Management: Safety Screenings). Conduct a fingerprint-based criminal history records check (CRC) of the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database on all caregivers and adult household members at least every five years from the date of the Initial Family Evaluation. The CRC must be conducted within 90 days prior to the re-evaluation due date (see policy 19.8 Case Management: Criminal Records Checks). Assess each caregivers place of residence using the Caregiver Home Inspection Safety and Compliance Checklist to determine if the physical environment meets the DFCS minimum safety and quality standards (see policy 14.1 Resource Development: Safety and Quality Standards). Ensure a comprehensive medical evaluation is completed for primary and secondary caregivers every five years from the date their home is approved unless more frequent evaluations are warranted. The medical evaluation must be conducted and signed by a licensed physician, physicians assistant, or public health department within 90 calendar days prior to the re-evaluation due date. Utilize the Prospective Foster or Adoptive Parent Medical Evaluation Report. Caregivers of children age 0 - 24 months must have an up-to-date pertussis (whooping cough) vaccination unless the immunization is contrary to the individuals health as documented by a licensed healthcare professional. Caregivers of children age 0 - 24 months and children with special medical needs must have an up-to-date annual influenza vaccination unless the immunization is contrary to the individuals health as documented by a licensed healthcare professional. Caregivers shall not be approved if the certifying medical official indicates that a caregivers health poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others. Direct threat is defined as a significant risk of harm to the health or safety of others than cannot be eliminated by modifications in policy, practice or procedures NOTE: When direct threat is the justification for not approving individuals with disabilities, the decision must be based an individualized assessment (see policy 14.11 Resource Development: Individualized Assessment). If the certifying medical official indicates that a primary or secondary caregiver (as applicable) has any medical, cognitive or other condition that will affect his/her ability to care for a child, or has an ongoing medical condition, the applicant must be medically re-evaluated at each annual re-evaluation until the condition is resolved. Medical evaluations are not required for other adult household members at reevaluation but household members under 18 years of age must have current immunizations unless the immunization is contrary to the individuals health as documented by a licensed healthcare professional. Document the medical evaluation on the Prospective Foster or Adoptive Parent Medical Evaluation Report.Request primary and secondary caregivers undergo drug screening at any time there is reasonable suspicion of substance misuse (see policy 19.25 Case Management: Drug Screens). Caregivers shall not be approved if positive results are reported for any illegal drug. Request primary and secondary caregivers to complete a financial statement. Ensure primary and secondary caregivers have completed the required amount of continued parent development (see policy 14.9 Resource Development: Continued Parent Development). Ensure primary and secondary caregivers have current certification in First Aid, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), for the ages of the children in placed in their home. Initiate a re-evaluation of approved caregivers whenever there are significant changes in the household that impact the caregivers ability to meet the Safety and Quality Standards (SQS) and the issues of concern cannot be adequately addressed through an addendum to the most recent Family Evaluation (see policy 14.14 Resource Development: Family Evaluation Addendums). Allow previously approved caregivers to have their homes re-opened within three years of a voluntary closure using the re-evaluation process. Suspend completion of a re-evaluation on a caregiver who is the subject of an active Child Protective Services (CPS) Investigation. If a disposition has not been reached in the CPS investigation by the time the re-evaluation is due, the home moves to unapproved status until a decision can be made regarding the future approval status of the home. Review the Caregiver Child Safety Agreement with the caregivers and obtain their signatures as confirmation of the review. Review the Confidentiality and Privacy Standards Agreement with the caregivers and obtain their signatures as confirmation of the review. Restrict the use of or disclosure of information concerning applicants and their household members including maintaining the privacy of protected health information (see policies 2.5 Information Management: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and 2.6 Information Management: Confidentiality/Safeguarding Information). Provide written notification to caregiver(s) regarding their approval status within five business days of the approval decision.PROCEDURESThe DFCS Caregiver Recruitment and Retention Specialist (CRRS)/CPA Resource Development (RD) Staff will: Track when home re-evaluations are due for completion to ensure each re-evaluation is approved prior to the last day of the current approval term and that no home has more than 12 months of approval. Under the Resource Development Staff Dashboard in Georgia SHINES, users can select the Retention tab to view homes with re-evaluations that are due. Under the Resource Development Staff Dashboard in Georgia SHINES, users can select the Compliance tab to view re-evaluations that are overdue. Initiate a comprehensive re-evaluation of the household at least 90 calendar days prior to the expiration date of the current approval term which allows adequate time to gather medical evaluations, update criminal records, etc. if needed.Provide caregivers at least 90 calendar days notice of the need for any medical evaluations or criminal records checks for themselves or household members. Gather information from Social Services Case Managers (SSCMs) who have supervised placements in the foster home during the period being evaluated. Gather information from children that were placed in the home during the previous review period, when practical and appropriate. Conduct safety screening on all adult household members (see policy 19.9 Case Management: Safety Screenings). Conduct a fingerprint-based criminal records check (CRC) of the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database on all adult household members if it has been five years or longer since the last CRC was completed. This includes household members who reached age 18 during the annual re-evaluation period.Carefully assess the homes compliance with Safety and Quality Standards and home safety guidelines regarding water safety, firearm safety, animal safety, etc. (see policy 14.1 Resource Development: Safety and Quality Standards). Gather basic data to determine present household status, including significant information on the current household, health, employment, and financial status. Require proof of current motor vehicle license and insurance. Include a verification statement that the documents were reviewed and are current and valid. Obtain feedback from primary and secondary caregivers. Give caregivers an opportunity to formally review their experience working with DFCS, and to share their view on the fostering experience by completing the Primary Caregiver Feedback Survey or Secondary Caregiver Feedback Survey. Confirm that primary and secondary caregivers have completed the required hours of continued parent development (see policy 14.9 Resource Development: Continued Parent Development). Confirm that primary and secondary caregivers have current certification in First Aid, including CPR, for the ages of children placed in their home. Identify the familys developmental stage and observe their interaction around the various tasks associated with their developmental stage (see policy 19.2 Case Management: Family Developmental Stages and Tasks). Interview/obtain feedback from all household members. Address the relationship between the Agency and the caregivers, including the caregivers ability to accept Agency supervision. Discuss the effects of children leaving the home and the ability of the caregivers to prepare them for leaving.Discuss the caregivers protective capacities and their ability to continue parenting the type of children for which they were approved. Review the past years disciplinary practices and issues. Review and have caregivers initial, as indicated, the Caregiver Child Safety Agreement at each re-evaluation. Review and have caregivers initial, as indicated, the Confidentiality and Privacy Standards Agreement at each re-evaluation.Address the caregivers continued parent development. Ask caregivers if there have been any 911 calls or arrests at their home during the past 12 months. Caregivers are expected to report all arrests and 911 calls to their home by the next business day following the occurrence.Include all members of the caregivers household in the re-evaluation process. Include the children who have been placed in the home during the past year, the caregivers interaction with these children, and their ability to meet the childrens needs. Examine the need for childcare services to continue, if applicable.Provide recommendations for the classification of the home, age, sex, number, and characteristics of children for whom the home is approved. a. Consider the familys developmental stage and how the characteristics of any future child placed in the home will impact the family. b. Include the beginning and ending dates of approval. Submit the completed re-evaluation to the Resource Development (RD) Supervisor and County Director for approval prior to the expiration of the current approval period. Notify the caregivers of the approval status of their home within five business days of the approval decision. 18. Update information on the FA Home page in Georgia SHINES. Document the reevaluation assessment period in Section 1 (From and To) in Georgia SHINES.The Social Services Supervisor will: Monitor and track home re-evaluations to ensure each re-evaluation is approved prior to the last day of the current approval term and that no home has more than 12 months of approval. Ensure all required safety screenings, criminal history records checks, and the Caregiver Home Inspection Safety and Compliance Checklist are completed. Meet with the Caregiver Recruitment and Retention Specialist (CRRS)/CPA Resource Development (RD) Staff to review the results of the safety screenings, criminal history records checks and Caregiver Home Inspection Safety and Compliance Checklist. Ensure all SAFE tools are used correctly. Review the SAFE Home Study Report to ensure that it is thorough and that all issues are identified and discussed prior to final approval. Complete the SAFE Supervisor Home Study Certification and include in the file. Ensure caregivers are given the opportunity to read the authorized portion of the Home Study Report pertaining to their family and have so acknowledged by signing the document. Routinely assess the foundational skills of the HSP (engagement and forensic interviewing skills; analytical and evaluation skills; and writing skills) and provide the education and support necessary to help the HSP strengthen skills as needed.PRACTICE GUIDANCEWhat is the purpose of the Family Re-evaluation? The assessment of an approved home is an ongoing process between DFCS/CPA and caregivers. A re-evaluation may be completed at any time during an approved homes one year approval period but is usually completed just prior to the expiration of the current approval period. The key purpose of the re-evaluation is to utilize information gathered during the approval term to determine if a home continues to be a safe and suitable environment for the placement of children in foster care and meets Safety and Quality Standards. Information gathered from various sources (e.g., in-home consultation, feedback from caregivers, case managers, children placed in the home, documentation, safety screening, training logs) is used to conduct a holistic review of the caregiver and household. Who is qualified to complete the Family Re-evaluation? SAFE Certified DFCS staff, SAFE Certified CPA Case staff, or contractors may qualify as a SAFE Home Study Practitioner (HSP) able to complete the Family Re-evaluation. Private contractors must meet the following criteria: Certification in the SAFE model; A minimum of a bachelors level of education in Social Work, Counseling, Psychology, or a related field; Ability to understand and implement the philosophy and conceptualizations inherent in pre-service training; A functional understanding of the agencys mission; and Ability to provide thorough, well-written home studies with supported recommendations.Updating a SAFE Home Study Go to www.safehomestudy.org. Select Download Reports. NOTE: In order to download SAFE forms and templates you must have completed the full two-day SAFE training and be a certified SAFE user. Enter your email address and select validate to receive an email that includes a link. Use the link received via email to access the applicable section of the website. Select the tab labeled Tutorials on the left side of the screen. 6.

GA :: Child Welfare Policy Manual :: Chapter 14 Resource Development :: Section 14.11 Individualized Assessment,Georgia,Rules,2023,"Administrative process, Contact and directory information, Definitions, Forms - Other",,,"REQUIREMENTS The Division of Family and Children Services (DFCS) shall: Ensure that no qualified individual with a disability is excluded (by reason of such disability) from participation in or denied the benefits of its services, programs or activities (see policy 1.5: Administration: Americans with Disabilities/Section 504 and Reasonable Modifications). Provide individuals with disabilities the opportunity to benefit from or participate in child welfare programs, services, and activities that are equal to those extended to individuals without disabilities. Conduct an Individualized Assessment (IA) of any prospective or existing caregiver under the following circumstances: An individual makes it known that they have a disability for which they are requesting an auxiliary aid or modification to the Foster Care or Adoption program; An individual has a disability that the home assessor reasonably believes may interfere with the individuals ability to be approved or continue to participate in the Foster Care or Adoption program; or The results of an Initial Family Evaluation or Reevaluation will result in a denial based on a covered disability. NOTE: The IA must be reviewed and approved by the DFCS Placement and Permanency Services Director (or his or her designee), prior to any decisions being finalized. Screen a prospective caregiver out of the approval process or close the home of an existing caregiver if the individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others. Eliminate eligibility criteria for participation that screens out or tends to screen out a person with a disability or any class of individuals with disabilities from full and equal enjoyment in such participation. This does not apply to eligibility requirements that are necessary for the provision of the foster care/adoption program.Provide an auxiliary aid or modify its policy, practice, or procedures if doing so will not fundamentally alter the nature of its foster care/adoption program or result in undue financial and administrative burdens. Assess individuals with disabilities on a case-by-case basis consistent with facts and objective evidence and not on stereotypes or generalizations about individuals with disabilities.Require Child Placing Agencies (CPAs) to create comparable procedures to ensure that their prospective and existing program participants are likewise protected under applicable disability laws and that all Reasonable Modification requests are documented.PROCEDURESThe DFCS Caregiver Recruitment and Retention Specialist (CRRS)/CPA Resource Development (RD) Staff will:Identify whether circumstances exist that warrant the completion of an Individualized Assessment (IA) to address the impact of a disability on the prospective or existing caregivers ability to meet the Safety and Quality Standards and skills required to be approved as a foster or adoptive caregiver (see policy 14.1 Resource Development: Safety and Quality Standards). Conduct the Individualized Assessment (IA) using the Individualized Assessment Tool for Prospective & Existing Foster Caregivers (IA Tool) if a certifying medical official, as described in subsection d below, states that a prospective or existing caregiver has a disability that may affect his or her ability to care for a child: Complete the IA Tool with the prospective or existing caregiver. Gather information regarding the nature of an applicant or other household members condition. Assess whether the prospective or existing caregiver is a qualified individual with a disability (see Practice Guidance: Individualized Assessment). Assess whether a qualified individual with a disability poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others. Direct threat is defined as a significant risk of harm to the health or safety of others that cannot be mitigated by reasonable modifications of policies, practices or procedures, or by the provision of auxiliary aids or services. Individuals deemed a direct threat may be screened out or have their Family Evaluation denied solely based on this factor. When direct threat is the justification for screening out an individual with a disability, the IA must include: Current medical evidence or the best available objective evidence in determining: The nature, duration, and severity of the potential risk; The probability that potential injury will occur; Whether reasonable modification in policies, practices, or procedures will mitigate the risk. If not, explain why. The actual abilities and limitations of the prospective or existing caregiver. Obtain the endorsement of a certifying medical official regarding whether the primary or secondary caregiver (as applicable) has any medical, cognitive, or other condition that may adversely impact their ability to care for a child or meet the DFCS Safety and Quality Standards (see policy 14.1 Resource Development: Safety and Quality Standards). For each Safety and Quality Standard and other necessary skill, assess whether the individual can meet the requirements. The IA shall specifically address the impact of a disability on the caregivers ability to meet the Safety and Quality Standards in accordance with policy 14.1 Resource Development: Safety and Quality Standards; and exhibit the following skills required of all approved caregivers: Understanding the Impact of Fostering /Adopting Teamwork and Communication Parenting Abused/Neglected Children Understanding Grief, Loss and Attachment Understanding, Preventing and Managing Misbehavior vi. Supporting Primary/Birth Family Relations Providing a Safe, Healthy and Nurturing Environment. Determine if the potential risks can be mitigated by a reasonable modification in policies, practices or procedures, or by the provision of auxiliary aids or services in a manner that will not fundamentally alter the nature of the foster care or adoptive services program or pose an undue financial or administrative burden on DFCS, as required by federal law. If not, a denial decision may be made based on this factorDocument the results from the IA Tool in Georgia SHINES within 72 hours of completion. Include the following: Name of the applicant and the date and time of the IA; Findings of the IA; and A statement indicating the basis of a denial, including whether the denial is based on a disability, and whether reasonable modifications could allow the applicant to participate. Upload the IA Tool into External Documentation in Georgia SHINES. Use the Foster/Adoptive Home Information Document Class and use the heading ADA Individualized Assessment. Consult with the Regional ADA/Section 504 Coordinator throughout the IA process for technical assistance. If it appears that a disability may interfere with the individuals ability to be approved or continue to participate in the Foster Care or Adoption program, ask the individual if he/she would like to request a reasonable modification. Direct all requests for reasonable modifications made by or on behalf of individuals with disabilities to the Regional ADA/Section 504 Coordinator for review and approval (see policy 1.05 Administration: Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)/Section 504 and Reasonable Modifications for submitting requests for reasonable modifications). If the results of an Initial Family Evaluation or Reevaluation may result in a denial decision based on an individuals disability, staff the case with the Regional ADA/Section 504 Coordinator and the Caregiver Recruitment and Retention Unit Director before taking any action that may adversely affect the ability of caregivers with disabilities to participate in the Foster Care or Adoption program. If there is concurrence at this level regarding the denial, that decision must be forwarded to and reviewed by the Caregiver and Wellbeing Coordination Section Director (or designee) for finalization. After review by the Caregiver and Wellbeing Coordination Section Director, the Regional Coordinator will forward all denials to the State DFCS Civil Rights, ADA/Section 504 Coordinator for final review and approval by the Division Director (or designee).Send caregivers a letter notifying them of the final decision regarding their request for reasonable modifications within 30 business days of receiving the request. Final decision letters must be signed by the local County Director. Letters of denial must include the basis of the denial. Upload the final decision letter into External Documentation in Georgia SHINES. Use the Foster/Adoptive Home Information Document Class and the heading ADA/RA DFCS Response. Upload any subsequent communications regarding the reasonable modifications request into External Documentation in Georgia SHINES. Use the Foster/Adoptive Home Information Document Class and the most applicable heading.PRACTICE GUIDANCEHow does the ADA define disability? The ADA defines disability as: A physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of a persons major life activities; A record of such impairment; and Being regarded as having such an impairment. What is a qualified individual with a disability? Federal law defines a qualified individual with a disability as an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable modifications to rules, policies, or practices, the removal of architectural, communication, or transportation barriers, or the provision of auxiliary aids and services, meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by a public entity. Individuals with disabilities must be provided opportunities to benefit from or participate in child welfare programs, services, and activities that are equal to those extended to individuals without disabilities. This principle can require the provision of aids, benefits, and services different from those provided to other parents and prospective caregivers where necessary to ensure an equal opportunity to obtain the same result or gain the same benefit, such as family reunification. For example, a child welfare agency must provide an interpreter for a father who is deaf when necessary to ensure that he can participate in all aspects of the child welfare interaction. Individualized Assessment (IA) Prospective or existing caregivers, with or without a disability, may pose a significant risk to the health or safety of the child that cannot be mitigated by reasonable modification. As a result, they may not be deemed an appropriate placement for a child. IA is a process used to determine whether a qualified foster or adoptive caregiver with a disability needs reasonable modifications to participate in the foster care or adoption program. The IA process is designed to assess the individual capacity of a foster or adoptive caregiver with a disability to provide a healthy and safe environment for the child.On a case-by-case basis, the IA is used to examine the circumstances of individuals with disabilities based upon facts and objective evidence. Decisions must never be made based on speculation, stereotypes, generalizations or unfounded fears about individuals with disabilities. Technical assistance may be requested from the Regional or State DFCS ADA/Section 504 Coordinator at any time during the IA. The IA includes a review of auxiliary aids, services or modifications that may be afforded to the caregiver so that they can participate in the program, and an assessment of whether or not the caregiver is a qualified individual with a disability as defined by the ADA (See 42 U.S.C. § 12131) and whether the caregiver poses a direct threat to the health or safety of a child in DFCS custody. What is the fundamental nature of the DFCS foster care and adoption program? The fundamental purpose of the DFCS foster care and adoption program is to promote the safety and well-being of children in DFCS care. DFCS seeks to identify qualified individuals to serve as partners in caring for, supervising, protecting and promoting the welfare of children in foster care. These partners serve as caregivers 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The recipient of the services of the DFCS foster care and adoption program is the child in foster care. Requests for Reasonable Modifications Participants have the right to request a reasonable modification (sometimes referred to as reasonable accommodation). The request may be made orally or in writing. The determination of whether DFCS will provide an auxiliary aid or modify its policies, practices, or procedures is made on a fact-specific, case-by-case basis and relies upon an individualized assessment of the caregiver making the request. For additional information regarding reasonable modifications, refer to policy 1.5 Administration: Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)/Section 504 and Reasonable Modifications. DFCS ADA/Section 504 State and Regional Coordinators DFCS has at least one state office ADA/Section 504 Coordinator and a coordinator for each region. They serve both foster care and adoptions programs. Before taking action, which might adversely affect the ability of a prospective or existing caregiver with disabilities to participate in the foster care and adoption program, the local DFCS office must seek guidance from the applicable coordinator. The Regions ADA/Section 504 Coordinator will serve as a second level reviewer/approver in cases where the local DFCS is considering not approving a prospective or existing caregiver who has a disability. If technical assistance or additional information is needed regarding DFCS civil rights compliance, the Regional Coordinator may contact the State DFCS Civil Rights, ADA/Section 504 Coordinator, using the information below:Division of Family and Children ServicesDFCS Civil Rights, ADA/Section 504 Coordinator2 Peachtree Street, N.W., Floor 29Atlanta, GA 303031-877-423-4746*Individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing may call 711 for an operator to connect with usTo receive contact information for the Regional ADA/Section 504 Coordinator, contact the DFCS State Civil Rights ADA/Section 504 Coordinator.FORMS AND TOOLSDFCS Civil Rights Discrimination Complaint Form (Form 724)DFCS Civil Rights Discrimination Complaint Form (Form 724) (Spanish)Individualized Assessment Tool for Prospective and Existing CaregiversReasonable¯Modification or Communication Assistance¯Reasonable¯Modification or Communication Assistance¯(large print)Reasonable Modification or Communication Assistance (Spanish)Reasonable Modification or Communication Assistance (Spanish large print)",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-14-resource-development-section-1411-individualized

Document a discussion of negative findings and justification for approval, if granted (see policy 19.8 Case Management: Criminal Records Checks). Visit each applicants place of residence and carefully assess the physical environment (e.g., living space, condition of the home). This is not a Home Study Interview. Complete the Caregiver Home Inspection Safety and Compliance Checklist. Confirm that the home has essentials such as safe drinking water, proper kitchen and bath facilities, etc.). If a home has a water well, the well needs to be inspected every three years as recommended by the Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH). Water wells also need to comply with the Georgia Water Wells Standard Act of 1985 that indicates the following: The upper terminal of the well shall be protected by a sanitary seal or cover to prevent entrance of pollutants into the well. Negative reports from sampling of the wells without the upgrade can be construed as safe with an advisory that the upper well terminus should be upgraded into compliance as soon as possible. Annual re-testing is required until the well is brought into full compliance with the Act. If a home has a septic tank, the septic tank needs to meet applicable specifications or criteria developed by DPH. Determine the date the tank was last inspected by a septic service professional and the date it was last pumped. If the septic tank has not been pumped within the last four years, consult with DPH to determine if there is a safety threat.Confirm that the home is safe and in a reasonable state of repair. Confirm that living arrangements are clean, safe, and free of hazardous conditions. Take photos of the sleeping areas proposed for children. Complete a water safety assessment for homes that have swimming pools, spas, etc. and take photos. NOTE: See policy 14.1 Resource Development: Safety and Quality Standards for information on home safety standards.Meet with the SAFE Supervisor to discuss the results of the home inspection, safety screenings, and criminal records checks to determine whether the family is eligible to continue the family evaluation process. If all findings are acceptable, invite the applicant to pre-service training and initiate the SAFE Home Study evaluation. Provide applicants the required Caregiver Onboarding Forms and Instructions after they have been determined eligible to attend pre-service training. The instructions are theirs to keep, but they must return the accompanying forms and other supplemental verifications with 10 business days. Download the SAFE Questionnaire 1 from the SAFE Home Study website and send to the family along with the Onboarding Forms. The primary caregiver, secondary caregiver, and other adult household members shall be given their own onboarding forms which must be returned. Onboarding documents include: Prospective Caregiver Application HIPPA Notice of Privacy Practices Authorization for the Release of Information Caregiver Home Inspection Safety and Compliance Checklist SAFE Questionnaire 1 (Q1)- Primary and Secondary Caregiver Safety and Quality Standards (SQS) Acknowledgement Statement Financial Statement for Resource Parenting Prior Service Reference Form Caregiver References List Caregiver Child Safety Agreement Confidentiality and Privacy Agreement Prospective Foster or Adoptive Parent Medical Evaluation Report Additional Household Member Medical Evaluation Report (if applicable) Supplemental verifications include copies of the following: Marriage License/Divorce Decree Death Certificate (if applicable) Income Verification Lease/Mortgage Verification Automobile Insurance Verification TB Skin Test Results  if not completed during medical examination Drug screening results Most recent Water/Sewage Bill Approved well inspection within the last three years, if applicable Approved inspection of septic tank within the last four years, if applicable Pet Vaccination Record Immunization records for household members under the age of 18 Complete procedures 1-6 before sending a referral to a Foster Home Development Contractor or some other Home Study Practitioner (HSP) for completion of a SAFE Home Study.The SAFE Home Study Practitioner (HSP) will:Acknowledge receipt of a referral for completion of a SAFE Home Study within 72 hours. NOTE: This applies to contractors and may be accomplished via email. Confirm receipt of the onboarding documents and supplemental verifications from prospective caregivers before scheduling the introductory home visit. Schedule the introductory home visit with the prospective caregiver applicant(s) to begin the SAFE Home Study process within five business days of receipt of the referral. The visit shall be held no later than 10 calendar days after receipt of the referral. Use the Q1 Harvesting Sheet to review the Prospective Caregiver Application, Q1, and other documents submitted by each applicant. Make notes on the Q1 Harvesting Sheet regarding issues that generate curiosity about each applicant in preparation for home study interviews. Curiosity should be prompted by possible strengths, inconsistencies and issues that might be of concern. Review the results of safety screening and criminal records history check. Meet with the SAFE Supervisor prior to the first home study interview to review the Prospective Caregiver Application, Questionnaire 1 (Q1) and Q1 Harvesting Sheet. Organize all the information that has been received up to this point and plan the home study interviews. Identify things that generate curiosity and plan to address them over the span of all the home study interviews, not in a single interview. If the results of the home inspection, safety screenings and criminal records history checks, etc. are satisfactory, contact the applicant to schedule the first home study visit. If the results are not satisfactory, consider other ways to partner with applicants (see policy 14.7 Resource Development: Inquiries and Information Sessions for ideas). Plan to conduct home study visits no less than seven and no more than 10 days apart. Conduct the number of home study visits and interviews necessary to complete the SAFE Home Study (see Practice Guidance: Home Study Interviews). Interview all children and adults who reside in the home or are frequently in the home. Discuss things that made the HSP and SAFE Supervisor curious. Complete the Psychosocial Inventory (PSI) following each home visit. Provide applicants the forms and instructions needed to obtain required medical evaluations, drug screens and CPR/First Aid training (e.g. Prospective Foster or Adoptive Parent Medical Evaluation Report, Additional Household Member Medical Evaluation Report, etc.), as necessary. Directly administer Q2 to applicants while maintaining sight and control of the tool at all times. Do not provide Q2 to applicants before the moment it is administered. Administer Q2 in a private setting. For couples administer Q2 with both applicants present and together.Instruct members of a couple not to communicate with each other or ask any questions of each other or the HSP while completing Q2. Conduct a private, one-on-one interview with each applicant after Q2 has been completed. For couples, ask one applicant to leave or go to another area of the home and interview the other applicant privately. Repeat the process with the other applicant. Interview applicants privately and individually for no longer than 45 minutes each. Meet with the SAFE Supervisor following each home visit for consultation and feedback.Send all references the Reference Questionnaire. After receiving a response, speak with each reference as needed to gather more information and seek clarification of any of the information provided. If applicants indicate they were approved in other states, take steps to secure confirmation and begin collecting information for the home study: Obtain a Release of Information; Contact the other state in writing; Obtain a description of the training content and number of hours earned as part of pre-service and in-service hours; Request a copy of the familys initial evaluation and any subsequent evaluations; Request a written recommendation from the state regarding the capabilities and protective capacities of the family; upload into Georgia SHINES. Send a written explanation, signed by the County Director/Designee or CPA Director/Designee, to all families whose Initial Family Evaluation will not be completed within the designated timeframe (i.e. no later than 30 calendar days after the applicant completes all pre-service activities). Indicate the reason for the delay and a projected timeframe for completion. Provide applicants the opportunity to read the authorized portion of the Home Study Report pertaining to their family and have them acknowledge doing so by signing the document. Send applicants a letter notifying them of the final approval decision within five business days. A home visit with approved caregivers will be scheduled within seven days of approval for the review and signing of the Caregiver Child Safety Agreement.Whether approved or disapproved, applicants must be made aware of their status within five business days. Initial contact may be made by telephone, immediately followed by a written letter to the family. If approval is granted, cordially welcome approved caregivers to the foster/adoption team and advise them of subsequent procedures. If approval is not granted, inform the applicants in an empathetic and supportive manner. Notwithstanding, the reason(s) for non-approval must be communicated in a clear, concise, and non-judgmental manner.The Social Services Supervisor will: Ensure all required safety screenings, criminal history records checks, and the Caregiver Home Inspection Safety and Compliance Checklist are completed before the HSP is assigned to begin the SAFE Home Study. Meet with the Caregiver Recruitment and Retention Specialist (CRRS)/CPA Resource Development (RD) Staff to review the results of the safety screenings, criminal history records checks and Caregiver Home Inspection Safety and Compliance Checklist to determine whether the family is eligible to continue the family evaluation process. Assign the home study for completion to a SAFE certified HSP who can address sensitive and difficult issues in an appropriate manner. Ensure all SAFE tools [Questionnaire (Q1), Questionnaire 2 (Q2), Q1 Harvesting Sheet, SAFE Desk Guide, Psychosocial Inventory (PSI) and Home Study Report] are used correctly. Meet with the HSP to discuss the Prospective Caregiver Application, results of Q1, and Q1 Harvesting Sheet to help organize the information and plan the home study interviews. Meet with the HSP following each home study interview. Meet with the HSP timely to prevent delays in the home study process. Review the Interview Worksheet to identify potential concerns and missed issues. Review the PSI after each home study interview and provide feedback to the HSP prior to the next home visit so the appropriate action can be taken regarding any concerns. Review Q2 after the Q2 home study interview. Review Desk Guide Ratings carefully. Check for expected SAFE Desk Guide ratings of 3, 4 or 5 as well as any surprise ratings that may require more discussion with the HSP. Ensure the HSP completes the sufficient number of interviews at the appropriate intervals (seven to 10 days apart). Meet with the HSP to discuss the final desk guide ratings and mitigation. Ensure that mitigation of a SAFE Desk Guide rating of 3, 4 or 5 is appropriate and supported by outside sources. Review the SAFE Home Study Report to ensure that it is thorough and that all issues are identified and discussed prior to final approval. Complete the SAFE Supervisor Home Study Certification and include in the file. Ensure applicants are given the opportunity to read the authorized portion of the Home Study Report pertaining to their family and have so acknowledged by signing the document. Routinely assess the foundational skills of the HSP (engagement and forensic interviewing skills; analytical and evaluation skills; and writing skills) and provide the education and support necessary to help the HSP strengthen skills as needed.PRACTICE GUIDANCEStructured Analysis Family Evaluation (SAFE) Home Study Components The SAFE Home Study is a placement document, an investigation, a psychosocial evaluation and a clear written report. It has four components:Information Gathering Tools - These tools support the Home Study Report and are designed to prompt the HSP to ask questions not provide answers:Questionnaire 1 (Q1)  It is completed by each applicant and covers eight areas of family history and functioning (i.e. Personal History; Parenting Practices; Personal and Family Values; Health; Support System; Work; Family Relationships; Marital/Partner Relationship). Q1 Harvesting Sheet  It is used to review the Prospective Caregiver Application, QI and other documents submitted by applicants. It helps organize information to provide a complete overview of each applicants specific issues, behaviors, or events that should be addressed in upcoming home study interviews. Questionnaire 2 (Q2)  It contains the sensitive and critical questions that need to be addressed in a home study (i.e. problem issues/behaviors; personal alcohol consumption; personal legal/illegal drug usage; family substance abuse; history of sexual, emotional, or physical victimization; child abuse allegations/convictions; family violence and crime; family sexual perpetrators; domestic violence; mental illness). Each applicant is interviewed privately and individually (one-on-one) immediately after the administration of Q2. Due to the sensitive and complex nature of these topics, this can be a very emotionally charged interview. Reference Letter  It was designed to enable the HSP to obtain more complex information about applicants for analysis and follow-up. After receiving the SAFE Reference Letter, the HSP should speak with each reference to gather more information and seek clarification of anything in the letter. Other than indicating they received the required references, the HSP should not mention the individual references specifically in the narration of the SAFE Home Study Report. Issues raised by references should be addressed with applicants. Any issues that merit a SAFE Desk Guide Rating of 3, 4, or 5 should be discussed in the Psychosocial Evaluation Section of the SAFE Home Study Report without revealing sources. Structured Analysis  SAFE has identified 70 Psychosocial Factors that research has demonstrated to be necessary for safe and effective parenting whether through adoption, kin or foster care. The Psychosocial Inventory (PSI) and SAFE Desk Guide allow the HSP to systematically analyze information gathered during the home study process, as well facilitate a clear and uniform identification of specific family strengths and issues of concern. The PSI and Desk Guide are grouped into the following nine sections: History; Personal Characteristics; Marital/Partner Relationship; Children/Others Residing/Frequently in the Home; Extended Family Relationships; Physical/Social Environment; General Parenting; Specialized Parenting; and Adoption/Foster Care Issues. The PSI is designed to look at a persons history of issues, concerns, behaviors and events and determine how they affect the persons current functioning and ability to parent. The PSI strives to help the HSP determine whether an applicant can parent, and if so, who they can parent. Only one PSI is used per family and is completed after each home study visit. The SAFE Desk Guide is a severity scale that indicates the potential seriousness of an issue, behavior or event experienced by an applicant. The PSI and SAFE Desk Guide contain research-based factors that support safe and effective family functioning and the ability to parent. The factors are rated on a scale of 1 to 5 and marked on the PSI. The ratings represent the following: 1=Exceptional Strength; 2= Strength; 3=Concern; 4=Serious Concern; 5=Extremely Serious Concern. A rating of 2 is the default rating until proven otherwise. A rating of 2 may also be used early in the home study process when the HSP does not have enough information to rate a factor. In other words, it can function as the I dont know rating until more information is gathered. A completed home study report should not have an abundance of 2 ratings which is not indicative of a thorough assessment. Any psychosocial factor that merits a rating of 3 (Concern), 4 (Serious Concern) or 5 (Extremely Serious Concern) must be specifically addressed in the Home Study Report. As more information is gathered during the home study interview process, a rating may move to a more serious rating, but not in reverse. As soon as possible following each home study visit, the HSP should mark the applicable SAFE Desk Guide ratings on the PSI. Entering the ratings while the visit is still fresh in ones mind prevents one from forgetting issues of concern or confusing them with other studies. A different symbol is used to mark the ratings on the PSI for each home visit. For example, the symbol used to mark the rating for the first home study visit is a backward slash, whereas the symbol used to mark the second home study visit is a forward slash. The SAFE Desk Guide ratings should reflect everything the HSP knows up to that point. After each interview, the HSP submits the PSI to the Supervisor for review and feedback. The final SAFE Desk Guide Rating is made after the last home study visit and must be made with a high degree of confidence based on the HSP and the SAFE Supervisors professional assessment.Home Study Report  The narrative is designed to assist the HSP in focusing on the issues of concern within a family that will or could impact its ability to care for a child placed in the home. A home study should be specific to the applicant. The HSPs should use behaviorally specific language and avoid repeating the same thing throughout the study. There are six sections to a SAFE Home Study Report: Non-narrative reporting required by the agency (i.e. general information; contact information; household demographics; medical/school reports; safety screening and criminal records history results; confirmation statements; attachments and verifications) Motivation, Profile and Lifestyles of Applicants SAFE Psychosocial Evaluation Conclusions and Placement Considerations Signatures and Approvals SAFE Psychosocial Inventory Results (NOTE: this page should be removed when the SAFE Home Study Report is shared with applicants) Compatibility Inventory  This is an optional matching tool designed to facilitate successful placements. This tool helps the HSP determine the willingness and ability of an applicant to parent children with certain issues and behaviors.Home Study Interviews The home study interview is the foundation of the home study process. The various gathering tools used with the SAFE model support the interviews and help the HSP develop questions for the applicants. HSPs learn more from applicants when applicants are interviewed at home where they are most comfortable. During interviews, HSPs should avoid using standardized questions and rushing ahead with their own agenda. Instead, the HSP should seek a natural, organic flow of communication with applicants. HSPs should trust their instincts but must be mindful of their own biases. HSPs must also remain keenly aware of non-verbal communication which guides about 80% of human interaction. No interview should take longer than an hour and a half. It is unlikely that any party will remain as alert as they need to be for longer than that period of time. Home visits should be no closer or further than a week apart because applicants need time to process the information covered between visits, but not so much time that they begin to lose information.The initial visit to during which the Caregiver Home Inspection Safety and Compliance Checklist is completed should not be confused with a Home Study Interview. These are two different things and should not be done at the same time. The home inspection is authoritative and regulatory whereas the home study interview is collaborative and transparent. The more interviews a HSP has with an applicant, the more comfortable the HSP will be about recommending approval or denial. SAFE recommends a minimum of four interviews (three meetings) to complete an acceptable home study report. Depending on the circumstances, more than four interviews may be required. HSPs should prepare a plan for which interviews will be conducted during each visit such as the following:Home Study Visit 1 (1st Interview) This is an introductory interview to develop the relationship between the HSP and the applicants. SAFE Questionnaire 1 (Q1) is discussed.Home Study Visit 2 (2nd and 3rd Interview if it is a two-parent home) The HSP administers SAFE Questionnaire 2 (Q2) and it must never be out of the sight or control of the HSP. This is a one-on-one history interview. The purpose is to examine issues, behaviors, and events that effect or could affect the applicants current functioning or ability to parent and how the applicant has resolved those issues. The focus is on past patterns of behavior. The HSP observes both applicants (or a single-parent applicant) while they complete Q2. The applicants are instructed not to talk or discuss the questionnaire. When Q2 is completed, the HSP immediately interviews each applicant separately and privately. No children or other adults should be in the home when Q2 is administered. If others must remain in the home, they should not be in an area near where Q2 is being administered. The HSP must skilled and prepared to handle sensitive and complex issues and work with emotionally charged situations. Q2 interviews should be no longer than 45 minutes each. However, due to their complexity, additional one-on-one/history interviews might be necessary before the marriage or support interview.Home Study Visit 3 (4th Interview) This is a marriage or support interview. The family and others residing or frequently in the home can be interviewed at this time. The number of interviews performed will depend on the number of individuals involved. The HSP should examine the applicants relationship with a focus towards the strength and dynamics of their marriage/partnership. For single applicants, the focus should be on their support systems.Mitigation Within the SAFE model, mitigation is where the HSP balances the truth (Final SAFE Desk Guide Ratings) and Justice (the HSPs clinical analysis of how those issues affect an applicants current functioning and ability to parent). Mitigation is a fact or series of facts that exist to support the decision to mitigate an issue/behavior/event and must be corroborated by outside sources (e.g. other family members, professionals, clinicians). The HSP does not use the SAFE Desk Guide during the mitigation process.

As necessary, such preparation shall continue after placement of the child and includes knowledge and skills relating to the reasonable and prudent parenting standard (see policy 14.26 Resource Development: Reasonable and Prudent Parenting Standard) for the participation of the child in age or developmentally appropriate activities, including knowledge and skills relating to the developmental stages of the cognitive, emotional, physical, and behavioral capacities of a child and applying the standard to decisions such as whether to allow the child to engage in social, extracurricular, enrichment, cultural and social activities, including sports, field trips and overnight activities lasting one or more days and involving the signing of permission slips and arranging transportation for the child to and from extracurricular enrichment and social activities. Prospective caregivers must complete a pre-service training program (IMPACT Family Centered Practice [FCP]) to become approved foster or adoptive parents for children in DFCS custody. Caregivers who voluntarily closed their homes while in good standing and desire to have their home reopened are not required to repeat IMPACT FCP if they completed it within the last three years. Child Placing Agencies (CPAs) shall be allowed to use nationally recognized and approved pre-service training programs [i.e. Model Approach to Partnerships in Parenting/Group Preparation & Selection (MAPP/GPS); Parent Resources for Information, Development, and Education (PRIDE); Parents as Tender Healers (PATH); or Treatment Parent Readiness Training ] if the training was completed within the last three years. Any other pre-service training requires approval from the office of the DFCS State Foster Care Services Director. Prospective caregivers shall attend pre-service training no later than 60 days after submitting the appropriate documents from the Prospective Caregiver Application Packet they received at the Information Session. IMPACT FCP Pre-Service Training sessions shall only be conducted by certified IMPACT Leaders who have completed IMPACT Leader Training offered through the DFCS Education and Training Section.DFCS/CPAs shall not allow parent co-leaders to be solely responsible for an entire IMPACT FCP meeting or an entire group, conducting individual IMPACT FCP sessions with families, or completing In-Home Family Consultations and Family Evaluations. DFCS shall hold IMPACT FCP sessions on days and times that meet the needs of the participating families.

If an unforeseen circumstance results in a missed session, a participant may make up the missed session(s) in another IMPACT FCP group or with individual meetings that satisfy IMPACT FCP requirements. However, the entire course must be completed within a 90-day period or the participant must re-start the training process from the beginning. DFCS/CPAs shall require all adult household members (age 18 and over) of prospective foster parents to complete IMPACT FCP if they will be involved in the parenting of children placed in the home. For adoptive families, these household members are strongly encouraged to participate. DFCS staff who will not actually lead IMPACT FCP classes shall receive an abbreviated overview session of the curriculum from Resource Development (RD) staff or another approved trainer. They could also attend the actual IMPACT FCP Pre-service Training for Leaders or participate in an IMPACT FCP group with perspective foster and adoptive families. At a minimum, the following DFCS staff shall be provided an overview of the IMPACT FCP Curriculum: Regional Directors; Field-based Consultants; County Directors; Deputy Directors; Social Services Program Directors and Social Services Administrators; Social Services Supervisors and Case Managers; and Independent Living Specialists.PROCEDURESIMPACT FCP leaders will: After an applicant has completed the Information Session, evaluate the needs of the family, as well as the needs and resources of the agency, to choose a mode of preservice preparation (i.e., group or individual sessions) for the family. Group is the preferred mode. NOTE: Approval must be obtained from the Regional Adoption Coordinator (RAC) in order to pay for individual sessions. Help participants make the decision to select out as a part of the joint selection process whenever participants decide they do not wish to foster or adopt. Participants who select out may be allowed to remain in the group, unless they are disruptive to the group. However, one-to-one sessions are discontinued. Complete IMPACT FCP within 10 weeks of initiation. County DFCS Offices may offer IMPACT FCP classes in the configuration that best meets the needs of their participants and still allows for completion of all hours within 10 weeks. There is an exception to this timeframe if there are missed sessions. Throughout the pre-service training process, conduct a minimum of three in-home consultation visits with applicants that run concurrently with classroom training. When possible, the initial in-home consultation visit should occur before the applicant attends the first session of IMPACT FCP Classroom Training. Document all consultations in the Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information System (Georgia SHINES) under the Contact/Summaries tab. Request a waiver of pre-service training for families who are approved to foster or adopt in another state and are moving to Georgia with children placed by that state through the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC). All applicable ICPC requirements must be met and the Georgia ICPC Administrator must authorize the placement of children from other states into Georgia. ICPC allows provisional approval of families. This means ICPC families can be provisionally approved before IMPACT FCP is completed. The family will have to complete IMPACT FCP within 120 calendar days in order to maintain approval status. If applicants were approved in other states, take the following actions to confirm the training hours and begin collecting information for the Family Evaluation: Obtain a Release of Information. Contact the other state in writing. Obtain a description of the training content and number of hours earned as part of pre-service and in-service hours. Request a copy of the familys initial evaluation and any subsequent evaluations. Request a written recommendation from the state as to the capabilities and protective capacities of the family (upload into Georgia SHINES).PRACTICE GUIDANCEIMPACT Family Centered Practice (FCP) Pre-service Training IMPACT FCP is a pre-service training program used to prepare prospective foster and adoptive families for their role and to expose them to the basic skills and competencies needed to begin providing foster and adoptive care. IMPACT FCP involves an instructive approach to preparing families. The curriculum includes an assortment of visual aids, audio-visuals, role-play, and vignettes to support the acquisition of skills and competencies. Woven throughout the training will be applicable references to cultural and disciplinary issues related to caring for children in placement. Upon completion, participants must demonstrate at least minimal mastery and internalization of the skills and competencies presented. The IMPACT FCP pre-service training addresses several areas that are required in establishing the basic skills and competencies needed to parent children placed in foster or adoptive care. These areas include the following:The Fostering/Adoption Process  includes supervision and safety issues for children in care; communication with the agency and other foster care partners; the judicial/legal process; discipline policy requirements and behavior management; cultural, ethnic, and religious issues; supports for the resource family; an awareness of personal and family strengths/needs and resources required to successfully foster/adopt; and understanding the role of the resource family in concurrent planning;Emotional/Cognitive/Behavioral Implications in Fostering/Adopting  includes loss and attachment issues and techniques for intervention; the impact of placement on the cognitive functioning of children; the familys role in working with professionals in meeting the medical, psychological, educational, etc. needs of children; supporting the agency in moving a child into the appropriate level of care; the immediate and long term effects of placement on the resource family; the agencys role in supporting collaboration between partners; recognizing and responding to emotional, psychological, and biochemical disorders; Sexuality and Sexual Orientation  includes sexuality as it relates to different age groups; recognizing and supporting children who have been victims of sexual abuse; supporting and responding to children who express sexual identity and sexual orientation issues; learning to recognize and avoid personal vulnerability to sexual maltreatment accusations and alleged overtures for sexual intimacy; expecting, recognizing, and coping with exaggerated sexualized behaviors; Communication and Partnership  includes defining the basics of communication patterns and the dynamics involved in communicating with partners; roles and responsibilities in initiating various types of communication; procedures to follow when communication is problematic; defining partnership and the various partners (e.g., resource families, agency staff, community agencies, faith-based groups, biological/extended family members, professional resources, and other resource families) involved in communication; and Identity and Cultural Issues  includes an examination of cultural, religious, ethnic and transracial factors impacting the placement and care of children, including the importance of cultural and ethnic identity; diversity; practical cultural and identity issues for resource families, including grooming, hygiene, customs, manners, social interaction, and dietary considerations.IMPACT FCP Used in Corrective Action Plans Pre-service training modules within the IMPACT curriculum may be used to address specific parenting needs when the County DFCS has developed a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) for a foster or adoptive parent. Families may be required to repeat all or specific sessions of the IMPACT program (e.g., meetings addressing discipline, sexuality, safety issues, etc.). This is applicable when the specific skills and competencies are available within the corrective action timeframe. The implementation of the CAP is not delayed due to the unavailability of the IMPACT series. Maximum Group Size The maximum group size for IMPACT FCP is based upon the needs of the Agency and the number of families with whom Team Leaders can comfortably work during the process. Counties must make the most effective use of their time and resources. A suggested average group size is 20 participants. Reducing the Waiting Period Potential applicants could become discouraged or lose interest if they are left waiting to begin pre-service training. Some strategies to help reduce the amount of time applicants have to wait to participate in pre-service training include:Conducting IMPACT FCP groups across county lines; Having reciprocal arrangements with other counties and agencies to make groups available to each other; Co-leading groups with other public or private agencies that have approved trainers; Referring prospective adoptive families to the Regional Adoption Coordinator (RAC) for linkage to a private adoption agency under contract with DFCS.Training Materials For materials and updates, counties must contact the Education and Training Unit or visit the following web address: http://167.196.164.34/IMPACT/default.aspx. IMPACT FCP Team Leader Training Leader training is obtained through the DFCS Education and Training Unit. Consistent Group Leaders It is preferred that group leaders remain the same throughout all assigned sessions of the IMPACT FCP curriculum to enhance effectiveness. Leaders should not start group or individual training if it is known in advance that they will not be able available for the entire duration of the series. Each leader brings unique perspectives and experiences to the learning process. Parent Co-Leaders Pre-service preparation is most effective when jointly presented by DFCS staff and a competent, experienced foster or adoptive parent using an instructive and practical approach. DFCS County Offices/Regions and CPAs should maintain enough certified parent co-leaders to meet the training needs of the county/region. Parent co-leaders should be active partners in conducting groups and share an active role in planning, scheduling, logistics, and delivery. The DFCS and parent co-leaders should collaborate following each group meeting to discuss the meeting and exchange feedback on performance. Caregivers selected to become approved co-leaders should:Be an approved, active caregiver; Demonstrate the ability to grasp and impart information; Have at least two years experience as a caregiver; Demonstrate functional knowledge and understanding of the general needs of the children in foster care; Demonstrate the ability to manage, nurture, and support children in foster care; Demonstrate a functional understanding of the DFCS mission to strengthen and support birth families; Have a positive working relationship with DFCS; Provide an environment that ensures the health and safety of the child; Understand the role they have assumed as caregivers and the ongoing impact this has on their family and themselves; and Have no active CPS investigations.Parent Co-Leader Scheduling Counties/Regions should develop an annual training plan and inform parents of plans and approximate times that parents will be co-leading groups. DFCS and parent co-leaders must ensure the needs of the child(ren) placed in the parent co-leaders home are being met before scheduling the parent to co-lead IMPACT FCP groups. The parent co-leader must be able to state how the child(ren)s needs will be met during the parents absence. Parent co-leaders with children placed in their home should not co-lead more than two IMPACT FCP groups a year or more than one group at a time.FORMS AND TOOLSBill for Services RenderedIMPACT Material websiteIMPACT Leader Trainings and overview trainings",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-14-resource-development-section-148-pre-service

They may also make web-based inquiries at www.fostergeorgia.com. The County Department should contact the Caregiver Recruitment and Retention Unit (CRRU) at the state office regarding concerns about the inquiry line or website.Information Session The Information Session (previously referred to as Orientation) constitutes the first phase of IMPACT Family Centered Practice (FCP) pre-service training/preparation and is mandatory for all potential foster and adoptive families. The scripted IMPACT FCP Information Session video and PowerPoint presentation should be used. Families approved by other states are also required to have the fundamental information needed to consider fostering or adopting in this state. The Information Session provides a basic introduction of applicable DFCS policy to assist interested parties in making an initial decision about becoming a foster or adoptive parent. Subsequently, they can determine whether to continue the process. The Information Session may be completed within a scheduled group setting or individually. Regardless of the format, persons interested in becoming foster or adoptive parents should not have to wait more than 14 calendar days to attend an Information Session. Making people wait leads to increased dropout rates, therefore DFCS must move quickly to help people act upon their initial interest and nurture their desire to foster or adopt. Otherwise, such interest and desire may gradually disappear resulting the loss of a potential resource for a child. Following the Information Session, persons interested in continuing the application process must complete all required onboarding documentation and supplemental verifications (see policy 14.10 Resource Development: Initial Family Evaluation). Any negative findings from safety screenings and criminal history record checks should be reviewed and approved by the County Director/Designee or CPA Director/Designee before an invitation to IMPACT FCP PreService Training is extended.Applicant This term refers to a prospective foster or adoptive parent who has made an inquiry or submitted a Prospective Caregiver Application but has not yet obtained final approval as a foster or adoptive parent. No individual should be denied the opportunity to apply based on race, color, or national origin (of the person or child involved).FORMS AND TOOLSProspective Caregiver ApplicationProspective Caregiver Application - Instructions",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-14-resource-development-section-147-inquiries-and

It shall be submitted by the date established annually by the Foster Care Services Director. DFCS shall direct recruitment activities toward a broad cross-section of the community and develop recruitment plans that provide for the diligent recruitment of potential foster and adoptive families who reflect the ethnic and racial diversity of children for whom foster and adoptive homes are needed, in accordance with the MEPA-IEPA. DFCS shall meet MEPA-IEPAs diligent efforts requirements by ensuring each DFCS County Office develops a comprehensive recruitment plan that addresses the following:A description of the characteristics of waiting children; Specific strategies to reach all parts of the community; Diverse methods of disseminating both general and child-specific information; Strategies for assuring that all prospective substitute caregivers have timely access to pre-service preparation and training, including convenient locations and hours of service; Strategies for training staff to work with diverse cultural, racial, and economic communities; Strategies for dealing with linguistic barriers; Non-discriminatory fee structures (i.e., cost of drug screens, medical evaluations, fingerprints, residential modifications, etc.).DFCS shall direct target recruitment for adoptive parents toward families who wish to adopt children who meet the states definition of special needs, and for specific children for whom adoptive homes are needed. A child with special needs is defined as: A child who at the time of adoptive placement has been in the care of a public or private agency or individual other than the legal or biological parent for more than 24 consecutive months; A child with a physical, mental, or emotional disability as validated by a licensed physician or psychologist; A child who is a member of a sibling group of two or more placed in the same home.PROCEDURESThe Foster Care Services Directors Office will:Establish annual statewide targets for recruitment and retention based upon available trend and data analysis. Develop new recruitment campaigns, brochures, posters, and media strategies focusing on the specific needs of the agency for foster and adoptive homes. Provide ongoing technical assistance in the coordination of recruitment activities as requested by the various DFCS regions. Relay information regarding recruitment and retention issues to respective DFCS regions. Review, evaluate, and provide feedback and technical assistance regarding the plans and progress of the regions as it relates to recruitment and retention. Provide monthly monitoring plans of regional recruitment and retention activities.Present a quarterly report focused on five major issues (recruitment indicators, retention indicators, closures, foster parent support, and statewide initiatives) during the Statewide Recruitment and Retention Meeting.To complete the Annual Recruitment and Retention Plan, the local DFCS will:Utilize statewide targets and goals to establish a profile of recruitment and retention needs within the county that addresses: Characteristics and numbers of children in foster care; Average number of children exiting care annually; Assessment of the usability of foster and adoptive homes; Annual number of home closures and the reason for closure; Assessment of past recruitment and retention efforts (i.e., areas needing improvement, efforts that were successful, etc.); County/Regional demographics of potential resources.Determine and document the strategies to be utilized for recruitment, such as: Use of church bulletins, flyers, and brochures; Informational booths at local fairs and carnivals; Participation in town hall and neighborhood association meetings; Utilization of existing foster and adoptive parents to provide information to groups about fostering and adopting; Participation in foster care or adoption celebrations, galas, parties, and picnics; Development of National Adoption Month and National Foster Care Month activities; Use of child-specific recruitment. Develop a calendar of scheduled regional and county recruitment activities for the upcoming calendar year (January  December);Determine and document the strategies to be utilized for retention of foster and adoptive parents, such as: Making forums available in which information can be shared with foster parents; Creating avenues in which foster parents can share questions/concerns; Assessing regional training needs in an effort to determine what general supportive or educational information is needed to increase the parental capacity of foster and adoptive parents; Providing ongoing training and support to meet the specific needs of foster and adoptive parents. Include strategies for meeting MEPA-IEPA requirements, the steps needed to carry out the recruitment and retention activities, and any possible barriers to implementation; Draft the Annual Recruitment and Retention Plan considering the aforementioned information and submit it to the Regional Director for review and approval; Submit the approved plan to the State Foster Care Services Directors Office by the date established annually by the Foster Care Services Directors Office.PRACTICE GUIDANCEThe recruitment and retention of caregivers is critical to the overall success of the foster care and adoption programs in Georgia. An effective recruitment and retention program is necessary to ensure the availability of appropriate resources for children who enter the foster care system. Recruitment and retention efforts must be designed to provide the community with information about the characteristics and needs of the children (and their families) requiring foster or adoptive homes, as well as the basic requirements and minimum standards. In addition to presenting information, it involves providing feedback and consultation. Effective recruitment strategies build public interest and awareness of the need for foster and adoptive parents for children. Recruitment efforts must not focus solely on developing a certain number of families, but on developing the most appropriate families to meet the needs of children in foster care. MEPA-IEPA and Recruitment Experience demonstrates that minority communities respond when given information about the need for homes and when they are treated with respect. Recruitment strategies must not systematically discourage or deter the interest of prospective substitute caregivers in transracial or interethnic placements. In addition, placement of a child in an appropriate household must not be delayed by the search for a same race placement. Moreover, DFCS must avoid the arbitrary use of race-neutral recruitment factors (e.g., income, age, educational level, family structure, home ownership status, etc.) that have the effect of excluding groups of people on the basis of race, color, or national origin.General Recruitment Strategies Examples of general recruitment strategies include, but are not limited to:Posting information about foster care and adoption on bulletin boards in various places of business within the community; Hosting an information table at farmers markets, fairs, and community festivals; Partnering with pizza places and other local restaurants to have them attach small flyers to pizza boxes or use tray liners that encourage people to considering becoming foster or adoptive parents; Utilizing existing caregivers to share their first hand knowledge of the needs of children in care and their experience working with DFCS to help meet those needs; Partnering with faith-based communities to inform the public about the needs of children in foster care; Engaging the medical community by providing information regarding the special medical needs of children in foster care.Targeted Recruitment Strategies Targeted recruitment strategies target a specific population in need of foster or adoptive home resources (e.g., teens). One strategy might include developing community based recruitment teams to build a resource pool for specific populations of children in care. Recruitment activities should provide potential foster and adoptive parents with information about the characteristics and needs of the target population. Recruitment efforts should focus on identifying an adult or groups of adults (e.g., church group, nurses, teachers, etc.) that potentially meet the needs of the target population. Targeted recruitment efforts may also focus on a particular area (i.e. zip code or school zone) in which there is a high removal rate. Child Specific Recruitment Strategies Child specific recruitment strategies help to identify caregivers for specific children in foster care. These strategies begin with a comprehensive child assessment and preparation process. Examples of child specific recruitment strategies include:Conducting intensive case file mining, including talking with older youth to explore past connections and important relationships with supportive adults who might be able to provide permanency at this time, even if they were unable in the past; Featuring children in photo listing services (i.e., Its My Turn Now Georgia and Adopt Us Kids); Using local media partnerships such as Wednesdays Child for featuring a child, youth, or sibling group; Developing a Heart Gallery- a traveling exhibit of high quality, compelling photographs capturing the unique personalities of children in care; Creating presentations with youth using technology (e.g., PowerPoint and iMovie) that can bring the personalities and stories of youth to life in their own words, pictures, and graphics.Retention Variables In order to maintain an adequate pool of caregivers to meet the needs of children in foster care, special attention must be made to the support that is offered. Homes are closed for a variety of reasons. Some home closures are related to positive events, such as a child being adopted by their foster parent. On the other hand, some caregivers request closure of their home due to negative experiences related to retention variables such as the following: Satisfaction with DFCS Staff  This includes customer service, response to phone calls, or any other interaction with DFCS staff or providers; Confidence in Ability to Meet the Needs of Children- This includes how confident the caregiver feels about being able to manage the demands of being a partnership or resource parent; The ability to express concerns without fear of retaliation from DFCS.Retention Plans County retention plans must address local issues affecting foster parent retention and may include activities such as the following: Customer service training for DFCS staff  Webinars and on-site presentations may help address general customer service issues, such as how to best respond to visits and phone calls from foster parents. AFPAG/Foster Parent Partnership Meetings  These may serve as a forum for foster parents to offer wisdom and expertise on ways to recruit, retain, and support foster homes. Regular email, phone or web based survey of foster parents  Surveys may help the county determine what is working and what needs improvement to ensure that foster parents are provided with ongoing support. Exit interviews with families leaving the program  Brief interviews with foster parents leaving the program should be conducted by staff not known to the families. Results of interviews should be used to assess current practices and make improvements. Clearly communicated Foster Parent Grievance Procedure  The County Director should use this opportunity to assess what event(s) occurred that caused the foster parent to file a grievance. Recommendations and lessons learned from the staffing and/or case review should be employed across program areas to improve practices as it relates to supporting caregivers.Respite care partnerships  Develop respite partnerships with parent support groups to ensure the availability of such resources when caregivers need a break. Procedures for placement disruptions  Establishing procedures for placement disruptions in advance helps reduce stress on caregivers and DFCS staff. All parties will know what is expected of them to facilitate a smoother transition for the child(ren) involved.FORMS AND TOOLSAdopt Us KidsIts My Turn Now GeorgiaWednesdays Child of Georgia",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-14-resource-development-section-146-recruitment-and

Utilization standards for foster homes must continue to be met at all times when children in foster care are involved (see policy 14.1 Resource Development: Safety and Quality Standards).DFCS and CPAs shall not approve a caregiver when their primary place of residence (the home into which a child would be placed) is used as a Personal Care Home or is located on the same property as the Personal Care Home. DFCS and CPAs shall check with Bright from the Start for any safety and compliance issues with family daycares during initial evaluations and reevaluations or at any time circumstances warrant such a check. DFCS shall not pay caregivers for providing childcare to children for whom they provide foster care services unless a waiver has been granted by the Foster Care Services Director. DFCS shall notify the licensing agency if a DFCS foster home that also holds a child care license or provides family daycare is closed because of serious policy violations or a substantiated CPS investigation.PROCEDURESWhen a foster parent notifies the agency of their desire to provide family daycare in their home or is operating a family daycare prior to approval, DFCS or CPA staff will:Discuss with the caregivers the effects of a daycare in relation to each child currently placed in the home considering such issues as: The age of the child; The special needs of the child; The frequency of birth parent-child visits; The effects of birth parent contacts on the child; The length of time the child has been in foster care; The permanency plan for the child; andThe childs adjustment to and sense of security in the foster homeDiscuss with the caregivers the effects of daycare on future placements of other children in the home and identify the type of child that might be appropriate for placement. Confer with the RD Supervisor and the County Director/Designee, then request a waiver from the State Permanency Unit Manager. Notify the caregivers of the agencys decision whether or not to grant them approval as a DFCS foster home with the operation of a family daycare. Document the agencys decision and update the foster home record appropriately in the Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information System (Georgia SHINES). Ensure that any caregiver who provides family daycare does not exceed the number of children that may be in the home at any given time (a total of six, including the caregivers birth children). Ensure a caregiver who provides family daycare does not provide daycare for more than two infants when an infant in the home has a permanency plan of adoption. Promptly intervene when it is determined that a child is adversely affected by a caregiver providing family daycare services in the home and consult with the caregiver, RD Supervisor, and County Director/Designee regarding whether or not to remove the child. Check with Bright from the Start to determine if the family daycare has any reported violations or citations prior to the completion and approval of the initial Family Evaluation and annual re-evaluation.When an applicant interested in becoming a foster parent or an existing foster parent is licensed as a Personal Care Home, the Resource Development (RD) Case Manager will:Notify the applicant at the point of inquiry, or the earliest point thereafter, that their home cannot be approved as a foster home for children in DFCS custody while their primary place of residence is licensed and/or used as a Personal Care Home. Notify any existing foster home that is licensed as a Personal Care Home that no additional children will be placed in their home while their place of residence continues to be licensed as a Personal Care Home. NOTE: Such cases will need to be staffed individually to determine the most appropriate and least restrictive placement for the children involved. A waiver must be requested from the State Permanency Unit Manager for children to remain in such placements. Notify a Personal Care Home provider who closes their home for such business that they may be approved as a DFCS foster home, provided all other agency requirements are met.PRACTICE GUIDANCEFoster Parent Provides Family DaycareChildren in foster care have experienced separation from their families often resulting in trauma and anxiety. Observing other parents and children separating and reuniting daily can be traumatic for already vulnerable children. It is possible that daycare for children known to the foster children may be less stressful, such as providing daycare for children who:Are relatives or friends of the foster parent; Live in the neighborhood; Attend the same school, church, etc. as the childThe decision regarding the number of children for whom a particular foster home can provide family daycare is based on the homes approval specifications as well as the number of children that would be in the home from the time school is out until the children in daycare leave. The maximum number is six. If a foster parent provides family daycare for more than two children for pay, the foster parent must be registered with Bright from the Start.Adverse Placement Effects in a Family Daycare Home When a child is adversely affected by caregivers providing family daycare in the home, consider the following questions in deciding whether or not to move the child:What areas of the childs functioning are being negatively affected in the home? What would be the effect of moving the child to another placement? Which possible placement resources could meet the needs of the child? What type of child is appropriate for future placements in this home?Meet face-to-face with the caregivers to discuss areas of concern. The caregivers must choose between discontinuing the family daycare and the child remaining in the home, or continuing the daycare and the child being moved. Bright from the Start: Georgia Department of Early Care and Learning (DECAL) Bright from the Start: DECAL is responsible for meeting the child care and early education needs of Georgias children.

However, unvented, fuel-fired heaters equipped with oxygen depletion safety shut-off systems may be operated in homes.Transportation Caregivers must have reliable, legal and safe transportation. Reliable transportation includes a properly maintained vehicle or access to reliable public transportation; Any privately-owned vehicle (owned by caregiver, caregivers family or friends) used to transport a child in foster care must be operated by someone with a valid drivers license, insurance and registration; Safety restraints (as appropriate for the child in accordance with the law) must be used when transporting a child in foster care. NOTE: See Practice Guidance: Motor Vehicle Safety for more information.Training Caregivers must complete pre-service training on the following topics (see policy 14.8 Resource Development: Pre-service Training): Rights, roles, responsibilities and expectations of foster parents; DFCS structure, purpose, policies, and services; Laws and regulations;The impact of childhood trauma; Managing child behaviors; First aid (including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for the ages of the children in placement) and medication administration; and The importance of maintaining meaningful connections between the child and parents, including regular visitation. Caregivers must participate in ongoing training to receive instruction to support their parental roles and ensure the parent is up to date with agency requirements (see policy 14.9 Resource Development: Continued Parent Development).Foster Parent Assurances Caregivers must not use corporal or degrading punishment. Caregivers must not use any illegal substances, abuse alcohol by consuming it in excess amounts, or abuse legal prescription and/or nonprescription drugs by consuming them in excess amounts or using them contrary to as indicated. Caregivers and their guests must not smoke in the foster family home, in any vehicle used to transport a child, or in the presence of a child in foster care. Caregivers must adhere to the title IV-E agencys reasonable and prudent parent standard (see policy 14.26 Resource Development: Reasonable and Prudent Parenting Standard).PROCEDURESThe DFCS Caregiver Recruitment and Retention Specialist (CRRS)/CPA Resource Development (RD) Staff will:Become familiar with the Safety and Quality Standards (SQS) for approved homes and review them periodically with caregivers Continue to monitor active placement resources to ensure compliance with SQS. Review the Caregiver Child Safety Agreement with all approved families and obtain their signatures at the following times: Prior to approval of the Initial Family Evaluation; At the time of a home re-evaluation; and Whenever there are child safety concerns (i.e., discipline or foster care policy violations, etc.). Inform caregivers of any observations of circumstances or conditions that pose a risk or potential risk to the health and safety of the child in the home and, if possible, provide measures for correction. Document all discussions and recommendations with the caregiver in the Contact Summary in Georgia SHINES. Notify the Resource Development Supervisor in writing of any safety concerns observed during home visits and the outcome of any discussion with the caregivers regarding observations (see policy 14.22 Resource Development: Policy Violations). Provide follow-up to ensure the homes compliance with home safety guidelines. NOTE: CPA providers should also see policy 16.8 Room Board Watchful Oversight (RBWO): Minimum Standards.PRACTICE GUIDANCESafety and Quality Standards The purpose of safety and quality standards is to ensure caregivers have the capacity to care for a child in foster care, and to ensure the physical home of the caregivers is appropriate and safe for a child in foster care. The standards strike a balance between allowing for individual circumstances, while establishing minimum requirements and are organized into eight categories. When children are placed into out-of-home placements, their health and safety are of paramount concern. It is the responsibility of DFCS, CPAs, and approved caregivers to take all measures within their power to reduce threats to any childs safety while in an out-of-home placement. The safety of a child in an out-of-home placement is just as important as it was back in the home of the parent. Caregivers need to be assisted in employing injury prevention strategies that promote the safety of the children placed in their home. DFCS must provide caregivers with easy access to child safety seats and bicycle helmets. Expenses incurred by caregivers in meeting agency approval requirements are reimbursable; however, caregivers should obtain prior approval before incurring costs that require reimbursement.Medication SafetyMedication must be administered to children in foster care only as directed by the prescribing physician. Medication must be administered by authorized adults. In addition, medication must be stored and transported in the original containers.Immunizations The prevailing medical opinion is that the benefits of immunization far outweigh potential risks. Therefore, in congruence with national model standards, Georgia DFCS safety and quality standards require all children in a foster home to be current with immunizations, including the biological children of the foster caregivers. In addition, all household members who will be caregivers for infants (birth to two years of age) or children with special medical needs are also required to have certain vaccinations. As indicated in the policy, there are medical exemptions to these requirements, but the important thing to remember is that these requirements exist to ensure the safety and well-being of the children and families served by the agency. According to a recent report commissioned by the Georgia Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics (GAAAP), children involved in child welfare scenarios often present with complex and serious physical, mental health and developmental issues rooted in childhood adversity and are thus designated as children with special health care needs (Szilagyi 2015). Upon entering foster care, such children may present with unavailable or incomplete health histories and are more medically vulnerable than other children who have not endured such adverse childhood experiences. According to GAAAP, a child in foster care who is exposed to a foster familys unvaccinated biological child(ren) is at extreme risk of contracting a serious and potentially life-threatening illness during his or her time in foster care. This is an unacceptable risk. Consequently, the Georgia Immunization Program (GIP) and GAAAP do not support placement of children in foster households in which members are not fully immunized as outlined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). In addition, GIP and GAAAP do not support the use of alternate immunization schedules or delaying immunizations citing that no scientific data have shown that delaying vaccination is beneficial to infants or children. Instead, delaying vaccination puts susceptible children at greater risk for contracting a vaccine preventable disease. This position is shared by the Georgia Department of Public Health and the Center for Disease Control (CDC).Water Safety Accidental drowning and motor vehicle accidents are among the leading causes of unintentional fatalities for children ages 0-24 months. Therefore, caution must be exercised when placing children in homes located on waterfront property or in homes that have swimming pools or spas. The age, special needs, and number of children in a home should guide decisions around placement in such homes. Caregivers whose primary or alternate place of residence (vacation or country home, etc.) is equipped with an in-ground or above-ground swimming pool, is situated on waterfront property, or is located within an apartment complex or subdivision with access to a community pool should be evaluated to confirm that they meet safety standards. Information regarding safety compliance of pools located in an apartment complex or subdivision may be obtained in collaboration with the management office of the apartment complex or applicable Homeowners Association. Below are some water safety guidelines:Caregivers should provide direct adult supervision of children around a body of water (e.g. beach, lake, pool, etc.) at all times. It is recommended that caregivers know or learn how to swim within the first 60 days of approval or within 60 days of acquiring a swimming pool. If no official form of verification is available, caregivers should sign a written statement attesting their ability to swim. The local DFCS should assist caregivers in locating resources for free swimming lessons. If free resources are not available, reasonable expenses should be allowed. The key to preventing water accidents is supervision, even if a child knows how to swim.Caregivers should complete basic water rescue training within the first year of approval to learn how to recognize, prevent, and respond to water emergencies using non-swimming rescue methods. Caregivers should provide written verification upon completion of the training such as a signed statement, letter, or certificate from the instructor. This training is generally offered by the Red Cross, community centers or aquatic centers. Caregivers should enroll children age three years and older in a swimming/water safety course taught by a certified instructor within the first year of placement if the children do not know how to swim. DFCS must make caregivers aware of any physical or emotional challenges that could impact a childs ability to complete the course. DFCS will reimburse the caregiver for the cost of the course. Caregivers should have a cordless phone, pool phone, or cellular phone close by to eliminate the need to leave children unattended near a body of water. Fences used as a safety barrier must be at least four feet in height, surround all sides of the pool, and have a gate that locks. Fences must have no vertical or horizontal openings that are more than four inches wide and must be constructed in such a manner that a young child cannot climb through or under the fence. In order for the side structure of an above-ground pool to be considered an adequate safety barrier to a pool/body of water, the steps or ladders must be removed to make the pool inaccessible when not in use. In order for an exterior wall of a home to be considered an adequate safety barrier to a pool/body of water, there must be an alarm on all exits from the home leading to the pool/body of water. The alarm must meet the standard of 85 decibels. Pool safety covers should meet American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standards and must be installed, used, and maintained in accordance with manufacturers specifications. Pool covers must be kept free of standing water and be completely removed when the pool is in use. Wading or Kiddie Pools must be used in accordance with the manufacturers instructions and maintained in a manner that safeguards the lives and health of young children. In addition, they must be emptied and stored away when not in use to prevent the accumulation of water and other unsanitary debris.Motor Vehicle Safety Children should have reasonable opportunities to engage in play and wholesome recreational activities. When responding to a caregivers request for guidance, one should take into consideration the child's psychological, medical, and developmental needs. Determine the type and safety of a vehicle and its suitability for a child. Also consider the vehicle operators and the plan for supervision. Discuss any restrictions (e.g., no use of public roads, daytime riding only, no racing or hot-rodding) and other safety measures, such as helmets, seat belts, flotation devices, and any other manufacturer's recommended safety gear. Caregivers must provide a properly fitted and securely fastened safety helmet for any child who is operating a bicycle or riding as a passenger on a bicycle. Extra caution must be exercised when allowing a child under 18 years of age to operate or ride as a passenger on a motorcycle, a motorbike, an all terrain vehicle (ATV), a high-speed watercraft, or other similarly motorized vehicles. These high-speed vehicles can be particularly challenging to operate; therefore, reasonable care and caution should be applied when considering a childs participation in such activities. Caregivers should consult with DFCS prior to allowing a child to operate a motor vehicle and comply with all agency policy regarding the operation of motor vehicles by youth in foster care (see policy 13.8 Independent Living Program: Driving Education, Licensure and State Identification). Children must be individually secured in an appropriately fitting seat belt (one child to a seat belt) when being transported in a motorized vehicle. Children under eight years of age must be transported in a federally approved child safety seat in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Children 12 years of age and under must be transported in the rear seat of the vehicle to protect young children from air bag injuries. Children are sensitive to heat as their body temperature can heat up three to five times faster than an adults. Children will die if their body temperature exceeds 107 degrees. Even at a temperature of 60 degrees outdoors, the temperature inside a car can exceed 110 degrees. A child in distress due to heat should be removed from the vehicle as quickly as possible and rapidly cooled. Due to the danger posed to young children left in hot cars, it is important that caregivers be reminded of motor vehicle safety as it pertains to hot cars and steps they can take to avoid related serious injury or death. Below are examples of safety precautions that could be discussed with caregivers during routine contacts:Do not leave children under 12 years of age, or children who are medically, emotionally, psychologically or behaviorally challenged unattended in a motor vehicle. Make a habit of looking in the vehicle (front and back) before locking the door and walking away; Ask the childcare provider to call if the child does not show up for care as expected; Do things that serve as a reminder that a child is in the vehicle (e.g., place a phone, purse or briefcase in the back seat, write a note, or place a stuffed animal in the driver's view to indicate a child is in the car seat); Always lock your vehicle when not in use and store keys out of a childs reach, so children cannot enter unattended; Teach children that a vehicle is not a play area.Firearm Safety Firearms claim the lives of an inordinate number of children each year. Consequently, DFCS takes a very conservative approach to firearm safety. Prior to entering foster care, many children experienced trauma associated with violence, including gun violence. These children need a living environment that evokes feelings of peace and safety. Some may have strong emotional reactions when in the presence of a firearm. Being in the presence of someone carrying a weapon may evoke feelings of being held captive or guarded. Some children in care already struggle with these feelings after being involuntarily removed from their birth family. DFCS does not want to do anything to exacerbate this problem. Consequently, even foster parents with permits to carry weapons are expected to refrain from doing so in the presence of children in foster care. Doing so is a violation of foster care policy, which requires firearms and ammunition to be stored separately under lock and key. Keys to locked storage devices containing firearms or ammunition must remain in the possession of an adult or be reasonably secured from children. As an added safety measure, any commercially available, reliable gun-safety mechanisms (e.g., trigger guard lock.) may also be used. See the Foster Parent Manual for a list of the types of gun safety devices that may be used. Under limited circumstances, with the prior approval of the County Director/Designee, children may be allowed to handle firearms. When making an approval decision, the County Director/Designee should take into consideration the psychological and emotional capacity of the child as well as any developmental or behavioral needs. If parental rights have not been terminated, prior written approval must be obtained from the birth parent. Following obtaining the necessary approval, youth ages 13 years and older who have successfully complied with all applicable hunting license requirements for Georgia, may engage in hunting activities while under the direct supervision of the caregiver or another approved adult. The caregiver or approved adult is also required to comply with Georgia hunting license requirements. Georgia requires completion of a hunter education course (including safety guidelines) for all persons born after January 1, 1961.Animal SafetyChildren are the primary victims of dog bites. Dogs with which children are familiar usually inflict such bites. Therefore, it is important to remind caregivers that re-immunizations for their pets are required either annually or triennially depending on the vaccine. Moreover, caregivers with exotic animals or wildlife (e.g., chimpanzees, snakes, raccoons, large mammals, etc.) must obtain a health and suitability statement from a veterinarian and approval by the DFCS/CPA Director. In the absence of substantive dog safety laws in Georgia, caregivers must take reasonable safety precautions when children are around pets. Serious consideration should be given to the type/breed of pets and their history of violence or aggressiveness toward people when assessing safety factors in the foster home. Any issues or concerns related to any pet (e.g., type, size, quantity, etc.) should be thoroughly discussed and documented during the assessment and re-evaluation process. Caregivers with animals should do the following: Safely secure animals that have a history of violence and/or aggressiveness toward people in a cage, fence or other similar enclosure. Provide opportunities and instruction to children in care regarding safe socialization with people-friendly breeds of animals. Report immediately (within 24 hours) to the agency any acts of violence toward a child in foster care or others by an animal in the foster home. Carefully review the Foster Parent Manual for information regarding animal safety.Fire Safety Fire extinguishers should be inspected regularly to ensure effectiveness. A local fire department would be a good resource for this service. Fire extinguishers with a Class A rating are effective against fires involving paper, wood, and plastics. Fire extinguishers with a Class B rating are effective against flammable liquid fires. Fire extinguishers with a Class C rating are suitable for fires in live electrical equipment. The recommended multi-purpose dry chemical extinguisher contains a dry chemical suitable for use on ordinary combustibles, flammable liquids, or electrical equipment. It is red in color and ranges in weight from five pounds to twenty pounds. It will have a label indicating that it may be used on class A, B, and/or C fires.Caregivers Need Certain Skills and Abilities Caregivers and DFCS work together as a team with a common goal of helping children achieve permanency. Caregivers will face many challenges as they seek to provide continuity of care while helping a child repair the effects of earlier life experiences. To do this type of work, caregivers need to have a number of specific skills that enable them to do the following:Understand the Impact of Fostering Caregivers must be able to identify their individual and family strengths and needs and communicate these to the agency. Caregivers should recognize how the addition of a new family member can affect family relationships (including the extended family), lifestyles, and support systems. Caregivers should understand their role in fostering and know the kinds of children whose needs they can best meet. Embrace Teamwork and Communication Caregivers must be able to communicate with the child, the agency, birth parents and other foster and adoptive parents who may have different outlooks because of different experiences, ages and cultures. Families must be able to understand and fulfill their roles and responsibilities in working with children, birth families, the agency and community. They must work in partnership to help children be reunified with birth families, be adopted, or move into independent living. Parent Abused/Neglected Children Caregivers must be able to effectively parent children who have been abused, neglected, abandoned, and/or emotionally maltreated. Families must help children develop a positive self-concept and identity, recognizing that past experiences and losses may have contributed to poor self-image and identity-confusion. They must help children understand and deal with the past in nonjudgmental ways, which helps children feel good about who they are. Families must know how to access outside assistance as necessary to meet a childs needs. Understand Grief, Loss and Attachment Issues for Children in Care Children removed from their birth families experience profound losses and need help managing their grief. Caregivers must have resolved their own losses and be able to anticipate the effects of future losses on the family. Since children who have experienced loss often have difficulties with attachment, families will need to understand attachment issues and be able to use specific techniques to help. Understand, Prevent and Manage Misbehaviors Children in placement display many behaviors that reflect the physical and emotional pain they have experienced. Caregivers must understand the feelings and the reasons behind the behaviors, and then help children get their needs met in ways that make children feel lovable, capable, worthwhile, and responsible. Caregivers must understand the reasons for and adhere to the policy proh",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-14-resource-development-section-141-safety-and

GA :: Child Welfare Policy Manual :: Chapter 14 Resource Development :: Section 14.0 Introduction To Resource Development,Georgia,Rules,"2023, 2022, 2021, 2020","Administrative process, Definitions, Foster parent licensing, Foster parent recruiting",,,"Georgia's Foster Care Program seeks to strengthen families, protect children from further child abuse, and ensure permanency for every child in care. When it is necessary for children to experience out-of-home placements due to safety threats in their own homes, the Division of Family and Children Services (DFCS) is committed to ensuring their safety and well-being. To fulfill this commitment, DFCS recruits and works closely with the child's kin (relatives, fictive kin), and members of the community interested in serving as caregivers for this population of children. DFCS also works in partnership with Child Placing Agencies (CPAs), which expands the number of placement family resources available to children in foster care. CPA caregivers who are to be considered for placement of children in DFCS custody must be approved, annually re-evaluated, and held accountable to and supported according to the policies in this chapter. Qualified individuals with disabilities will be afforded an equal opportunity to participate in, and benefit from, the DFCS foster care and adoption program. Moreover, DFCS and CPAs will not discriminate based on disability in decisions relating to the selection, retention, or termination of participants in the foster care and adoption program. This applies in every phase of the process to become a foster or adoptive parent, from initial inquiry to approval. For more information, see policies 1.4 Administration: Non-Discriminatory Child Welfare Practices and 1.5 Administration: Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)/Section 504 and Reasonable Modifications.The DFCS caregiver practice model is called Partnership Parenting. Partnership Parenting is a trauma-informed shared parenting model between caregivers and birth parents that is designed to keep parents parenting while their children are in out-of-home placement. By keeping parents connected and involved with parenting their children, permanency can be achieved faster, the trauma of placement can be reduced, child and parent bonds can be preserved, and parents can demonstrate and increase their parental protective capacities. Partnership Parenting also emphasizes and supports concurrent permanency planning. Caregiver Types Throughout this chapter, the general term caregiver is used to collectively refer to all foster parent types, including those who serve through CPAs. The Partnership Parenting model has the following types of caregivers: 1. Partnership Parents (PPs) are foster parents who provide temporary homes for children in foster care. They are expected to work in partnership with birth families and act as parenting mentors whenever possible. PPs share parenting responsibilities with birth parents through parenting opportunities. Parenting opportunities are any favorable times, occasions, situations, or conditions that allow a parent to safely teach, support, nurture, discipline, care for, or guide children. 2. Kinship Partnership Parents (KPPs) are foster parents related by blood, marriage, or adoption to children placed in their home. This includes the spouse of any of those persons even if the marriage was terminated by death or dissolution. Kinship includes ""fictive kin"", which means a person who is not related to the child by blood, marriage, or adoption but who prior to the childs placement into foster care is known to the family, has a substantial and positive relationship with the child, and is willing and able to provide a suitable home for the child. KPPs follow the same approval process as regular PPs and have all the benefits and responsibilities associated with being a PP, including full foster care per diem reimbursement. 3. Adoptive Parents are forever families who make a lifelong commitment to a child. They serve children whose birth parents parental rights have been voluntarily surrendered or terminated by a court, thus making the children legally free for adoption. Adoptive Parents may also be part of a childs kinship circle in which case they are called Kinship Adoptive Parents. 4. Adoptive Parent-Legal Risk Parents are adoptive parents who except for placement children who are not completely legally free for adoption and thus, legal risk exists in accepting the placement. 5. Resource Parents (RPs) are foster parents who are willing to become the adoptive parent (permanent family) for a child placed in their home. Children placed with RPs have a concurrent permanency plan, meaning that two permanency goals are being pursued simultaneously. At least one of the permanency goals is adoption with the RP named as the permanency resource. RPs must be able to concurrently fulfill the roles of being a PP and an adoptive parent. A RP may also be part of a childs kinship circle in which case they are called Kinship Resource Parents. 6. Caregivers serving children through the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC) are known as ICPC-Partnership Parents, ICPC- Adoptive Parents, ICPC-Kinship Partnership Parents and ICPC-Kinship Adoptive Parents. Caregiver Applicants Prior to final approval, all prospective caregivers are referred to as applicants. Applicants are evaluated to ensure they possess the protective capacities needed to ensure children in foster care remain safe from danger and can provide appropriate nurturing and family life for the children.Applicants who meet the qualifications for approval partner with DFCS, CPAs, and parents to ensure the safety, well-being and permanency of children. The caregiver preparation and service continuum helps applicants make an informed decision about becoming a caregiver. Applicants receive information and training to enhance their parenting knowledge and skills, as well as to clarify their role when working with children, their families, and other community partners. The preparation and training continuum includes a mechanism for providing practical knowledge of available financial, structural, and administrative support. It also addresses skills and competencies required to meet the behavioral and psychosocial needs of children in care. Moreover, the preparation and service continuum serves as a strategy to develop and enhance the pool of approved caregivers. A well-prepared and supported caregiver directly impacts the strength, success, and overall positive outcomes of Georgias foster care program. Caregiver Preparation and Service Continuum The preparation and training continuum addresses three important phases of family readiness in caring for children in foster care: 1. Phase 1: Inquiry: Inquiry is made through the Foster Georgia Inquiry Line (1-877-210-KIDS [5437]) or the Foster Georgia Website (www.fostergeorgia.com). 2. Phase 2: Information Session: The Information Session provides basic information about the child welfare system, types of caregivers, safety screening requirements and other key points to help prospective caregivers decide whether to proceed or opt out of the evaluation process. 3. Phase 3: Pre-service Training and Initial Home Evaluation: IMPACT Family Centered Practice (FCP)2 training provides families with preliminary information, competencies and skills, as well as the philosophical framework they will need to begin providing care for children. The acronym IMPACT stands for: Initial interest Mutual selection Pre-service training Assessment Continuing development Trauma-Informed Teamwork Continued Parent Development After final approval of their Initial Family Evaluation, caregivers are reassessed annually. Support services including on-going educational activities are also provided. Continuing education is crucial and impacts the continued readiness of families to meet the ever-changing and varied needs of children in care. It begins during the first year of approval. This requires honest disclosure by families and keen observations by DFCS Case Managers regarding the training needs of these families.

The first reporting period data was then due no later than March 15, 2011. Subsequent data submission to NYTD is required semi-annually based on two reporting periods, October 1 through March 31, and April 1 through September 30 of the reporting year. In order to comply with Federal statutes and to ensure that all youth are receiving life skills development services the SSCM and ILS must ensure that the NYTD services categories are documented each reporting period. Service providers include DFCS or an agent of DFCS including but not limited to:Non-relative foster homes;Kinship foster homes (whether or not payments are being made to the caregiver);Group homes;Emergency shelters;Residential facilities;Child care institutions (public facilities with less than 25 beds);Private facilities (with any number of beds); andPre-adoptive homes.Served Population CriteriaA youth meets the criteria to be classified as in the Served Population if during the reporting period:The youth is eligible to receive independent living services; andThe youth receives an independent living service paid for or provided by DFCS during the reporting period.NOTE: The Served Population is not limited on the Federal level by placement type.

This may occur at any time, including the following:During the initial transition planning meeting;During regular monthly contacts;During the Foster Care exit meeting.Discuss with youth the importance of designating another individual to make health care related decisions on his/her behalf should the youth become unable to participate in such decision making.Provide youth with the Georgia Advance Directive for Health Care if the youth elects to designate such an individual.If necessary, assist youth with completing and executing the Georgia Advance Directive for Health Care.Advise youth to maintain the document in a secure location with other important documents.The SSCM or ILS will maintain a copy of the form in External Documents in Georgia SHINES, the Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information System. If a youth receives EYSS at age 18, the SSCM will:Notify Rev Max when the youth reaches 18 years of age with a Notification of Change via Georgia SHINES.At age 18, youth are no longer Title IV-E eligible.Rev Max will determine the class of assistance for the 18 year old (i.e. Child Welfare Foster Care).Document in the Case Narrative in Georgia SHINES the Medicaid Class of Assistance (COA) determined by Rev Max.Update all changes in the youths physical placement (e.g. youth resides in a college dorm, transitional housing, etc.) If a youth opts out of foster care at age 18 or older, the SSCM or ILS will:Send Rev Max the youths new residential address and legal status.Rev Max will complete the transition to another Medicaid COA. This keeps youth from having to complete a new application online at a DFCS office, or at a Right From the Start (RSM) Outreach Project office.At the beginning of the month following the youths exit from foster care, the new Medicaid COA will automatically take effect and a Medicaid card will be sent out.Annual renewal will entail verification of continued Georgia residency.After Rev Max changes the COA, a youth may then apply for SNAP with the Medicaid linked in SUCCESS to the Food Stamp case.Provide or assist the youth with obtaining his/her identification informationGeorgia Identification Card;b. Social Security Card; andBirth CertificatePRACTICE GUIDANCE Regular preventive health care is important for all people and medical bills can be financially disastrous even for those who are generally healthy. Many children enter foster care suffering from poor health and chronic physical and emotional illnesses. As they reach age 18 and older, these young people need continuous health care to successfully transition to adulthood. Medicaid coverage serves as the primary safety net for this population, even if they opt out of foster care at age 18 or older. MedicaidThe Medicaid program is a joint federal/state program that is authorized under the Social Security Act. Funds are available to states for providing medical services to eligible recipients and for reimbursing activities that support the administration of the Medicaid program. DFCS accesses Medicaid funds through the Department of Community Health (DCH) and the Division of Medical Assistance (DMA) for case management and services for children in out- of-home care. Consequently, the Medicaid Class of Assistance (COA) for which these youth may qualify must be determined. Each COA has resource limits and certain deductibles. Most children in foster care are eligible for Medicaid. Child Welfare Foster Care (CWFC)CWFC Medicaid provides medical coverage to youth 18 to 21 years of age receiving EYSS or participating in the ILP after opting out of foster care. Eligibility continues through the month in which the youth reaches age 21 provided that eligibility requirements are met after the youth turns 18. The youth must meet citizenship/alien/age requirements. Youth 18-21 years of age receiving EYSS may continue to receive CWFC. John H. Chafee Foster Care Independence Program Medicaid CoverageEffective July 1, 2008, the Foster Care Independence Act allowed Medicaid coverage to be extended to age 21 for youth who opted out of foster care at age 18. The youths Medicaid eligibility is allowed to continue unless one of the following occurs:The youth dies;The youth moves out of state;The youth requests closure of their Medicaid case;DFCS determines another Medicaid program would be more beneficial;The youth is incarcerated; orThe youth fails to cooperate with their eligibility redetermination or case review. Chafee Medicaid is also available to youth who were in foster care during the month of their 18th birthday, but choose to exit. For example, if a youth decides to exit EYSS/ILP at age 20, the youth is still eligible for Chafee Medicaid until age 21 if the youth was in foster care during the month in which the youth reached the age of 18. Former Foster Care MedicaidThis type of Medicaid became effective 01/01/ 2014 in accordance with the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The ACA allows Medicaid coverage to be extended for individuals who opt out offoster care, or out of Chafee, until the last day of the month in which they reach 26 years of age. Applicants may not be determined ineligible based on a diagnosis or pre-existing condition. The eligibility month is the month following the youths 18th birthday, the month following the closure of Chafee Medicaid, or until the youth reaches the age 26 (as long as the youth was in foster care during the month of their 18th birthday). Georgia Families 360ËOn March 03, 2014, the Georgia Department of Community Health (DCH) transitioned from a standard fee-for-service Medicaid program to a statewide Medicaid Care Management Organization (CMO) through Amerigroup Georgia Managed Care Company. The transition impacted children in DFCS custody and children receiving AA as they became members of a new program called Georgia Families 360Ë which is separate from Georgia Families, the general Medicaid program administered by DCH. Georgia Families 360Ë is designed to provide coordinated care across multiple services and focus on the physical, dental, and behavioral needs of member children. The program is designed to ensure each member has a medical and dental home, access to preventive care screenings, and timely assessments. It also seeks to ensure medical providers adhere to clinical practice guidelines and evidence-based medicine. Advance Directive for Health CareEffective October 1, 2010 the Foster Care Independence Act required that adolescents participating in the Chafee program be provided with education about the importance of designating another individual to make health care treatment decisions on their behalf if the youth becomes unable to participate in such decisions. Youth should be educated about the importance of this designation, and must understand how to execute a health care proxy or health care power of attorney. Youth should understand that if they become unable to participate in their own health care decisions, and do not have a relative authorized under State Law to make such decisions on their behalf, there are options available to designate an individual to make health care decisions on their behalf and in line with their wishes.FORMS AND TOOLS Georgia Advanced Directive for Health Care",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-13-independent-living-program-section-1310-medical

Funds are based on availability. Also, note that there is a cap for these costs, therefore, if the cost of the course is more than the cap, the DFCS county office will be responsible for the additional costs or will need to seek a course within the budget limit.Upon completion of a Driver's Education course and subsequent written examination, assist the youth in obtaining an instructional permit through the Georgia Department of Driver's Services (DDS);As a part of the evaluation of the youth's Graduated Independence Plan, evaluate regularly the youth's driving experience with the foster parent or RBWO provider and the parent or guardian (when applicable), making adjustments as necessary based on the youth's performance and maturity; andAs the youth completes the requirements of Joshua's law, assist the youth in obtaining upgrades in licensure. Obtaining Driver's Education and an Licensure for Youth Age 18-21 Participating in the Extended Youth Support Services (EYSS) ProgramAs written permission is not required for youth ages 18-21 participating in the EYSS program, upon the youth's decision to obtain their driver's license the SSCM will:Assist the youth in obtaining the required identification and documentation necessary to enroll in Driver's Education and/or obtain their driver's license;Assist the youth in enrolling in an accredited Driver's Education course through their school or local community; NOTE: Request the ILS to enroll and pay all applicable fees for the youth to complete a community based driver's education course if there is not a course offered through the youth's local school system.

At least forty (40) hours of supervised driving experience is still required (6 hours at night) prior to obtaining a driver's license. EYSS youth who seek to own a vehicle or obtain a license should also do so in consultation with their placement provider and SSCM as these youth will be legally responsible for all acts or omissions that result from them driving or owning a vehicle. Obtaining a Secure Identification CardDuring the initial transition planning meeting that is to occur within 90 days of a youth turning 17 (see policy 13.4 Independent Living Program: Transition from Foster Care), it must be determined if a youth has obtained a form of identification (ID) that will meet federal and state Secure ID requirements  specifically, a driver's license or an identification card issued by the Georgia Department of Driver Services (DDS).If the youth is in the process of obtaining a driver's license at the time of the initial transition planning meeting, the SSCM should proceed as appropriate with steps indicated above to support the youth in the process.

Documented steps must be completed and any remaining items must be secured prior to the youth's exit from foster care. Progress on steps detailed in the transition plan will be reviewed at least monthly by the SSS to ensure completion. PRACTICE GUIDANCEDetermining When a Youth is Ready to Obtain a Driver's LicenseYouth in foster care may be granted permission to obtain an Instructional Permit, Provisional or Full License to drive a car and/or participate in a community based driver's education program beginning at 15 years of age. Youth and their caregiver's (birth parents and/or foster or adoptive parents) will be required to meet all requirements beginning at the time the youth reaches the age of 16 years in order to obtain and maintain a valid Georgia driver's license. Before determining that a youth is ready to begin the process of obtaining a driver's license the SSCM in collaboration with the Social Services Supervisor (SSS) and the youth's birth/adoptive parent and/or foster parent should be consulted to determine:The judgment and maturity of the youth;Relationship between youth and caregiver;Completion of a formal driver's education course or informal instruction;School performance;Intended use of the vehicle (needed for school, work, etc.);Previous driving record, if appropriate;History of runaway or other status offenses;History of drug/alcohol use; andProgress with the WTLP/GIP. So that all expectations are clear if the caregiver is going to allow youth to drive their vehicle, there should also be a ""Driving Contract"" between the youth and caregiver regarding the use of the vehicle (See Sample Driving Contract). In addition to the youth's behavior and maturity level, Georgia State Law also states that in order to obtain an Instructional Permit/Intermediate License, the youth must provide acceptable proof that he/she has received a:High school diploma;GED;Special education diploma;Certificate of high school completion;Has terminated high school and enrolled in a post-secondary school;Has withdrawn from school with permission of parent or guardian; andIs enrolled in, not suspended from, and attending a public, private school or the youth is being home schooled. Georgia State Law also states that an Instructional Permit/Intermediate License will be suspended if any of the following occur:If the youth drops out of school without graduating and has remained out of school for ten consecutive days;If the youth has more than ten consecutive school days of unexcused absences in any semester or combination of two consecutive quarters; orThe youth has been suspended from school for:Threatening, striking or causing bodily harm to a teacher or other school personnel;Possession or sale of drugs or alcohol on school property; orPossession or use of a weapon on school property. Drivers Education CoursesDriver's Education Courses may consist of classroom learning, on the road practice or a combination of both. Courses that are conducted in the classroom only do not require any type of license or permit to complete. Courses that include driving experience outside the classroom will require an instructional permit. For youth who are in foster care or participating in the EYSS program it is preferred that the Driver's Education Course they attend include theAlcohol and Drug Awareness Component (ADAP), as the youth will be required to take this portion of driver's education separately if not included in the curriculum. Youth who are delayed in obtaining the identification required to obtain a driver's license or who do not have a caregiver who is able to provide on the road practice experience may only obtain classroom driver's education until these requirements can be met. Youth may obtain a copy of the Georgia Driving Manual from the Georgia Department of Public Safety, a Georgia State Patrol Office, or may access the manual online at www.georgianet.org/dps. Teenage and Adult Driver Responsibility Act (TADRA) and Joshua's Law1All youth in Georgia are subject to the Teenage and Adult Driver Responsibility Act (TADRA), which incorporates Joshua's Law. TADRA requires a graduated driver's license program for driver's age 15 to 18 years old and involves an intense, three-step education process that allows young drivers to gain more experience behind the wheel. Three-Step Process in TADRASTEP ONE - INSTRUCTIONAL PERMIT (CP) is granted to 15-year-olds upon successfully passing a written examination. The driver with this permit must be accompanied by a passenger who is at least 21 years old and possesses a valid Class C driver's license at all times while driving.STEP TWO - INTERMEDIATE LICENSE (Class D) The license is granted to drivers between 16 and 18 years of age who have held an Instructional Permit for 12 months and passed a driving test. The Intermediate License has the following restrictions:No driving between the hours of 12 a.m. and 6 a.m. No exceptions;Passenger restrictions:For the initial six-month period immediately following the issuance of a Class D license, any Class D license holder shall not drive a motor vehicle upon the public roads, streets or highways of this state when any other passenger in the vehicle is not a member of the driver's immediate family.During the second six-month period immediately following issuance of a Class D license, any Class D license holder shall not drive a motor vehicle upon the public roads, streets or highways of this state when more than one other passenger in the vehicle (who is not a member of the drivers immediate family) is less than 21 years of age.After the second six-month period, any Class D license holder shall not drive a motor vehicle upon the public roads, streets or highways of this state when more than three other passengers in the vehicle (who are not members of the drivers immediate family) are less than 21 years of age.Joshua's Law - On or after January 1, 2007, any 16-year-old who obtains an initial Class D license must have completed:A driver education course approved by the Department of Driver Services; andA cumulative total of at least 40 hours of other supervised driving experience, including at least six hours at night. NOTE: If the youth has not completed an approved driver's education course, they cannot get their Class D driver's license until they reach age seventeen (17).STEP THREE - A FULL LICENSE (Class C) driver's license is granted to drivers ages 18 years of age and older who hold the class D license and have incurred no major traffic convictions during the previous 12 months. The following violations must not occur during this period:DUI;Eluding a police officer;Drag racing;Reckless driving;Hit and run; orAny violation that assesses four or more points on the driver's license Drivers under the age of 18 years in a 12-month license suspension period must not incur a violation point count over four points. Georgia has a zero tolerance for underage drunk driving. Convicted drivers with a blood- alcohol content level of .08 grams or higher will face a 12-month license suspension on the first offense. For more information on TADRA or Joshuas Law, visit the Georgia Department of Drivers Services website at www.dds.ga.gov Department of Driver Services (DDS) Secure Identification RequirementsDDS has implemented procedures that enhance the integrity and security of Driver's License (DL) and Identification Cards (ID) resulting from the Federal requirements of the Real ID Act.

Step Two Grievance: If the complaint is not satisfactorily resolved within 10 business days from the date the complaint is received by the ILS, submit a written complaint to the DFCS Division Director along with a copy of the original complaint filed with the ILS, the written response, and any other pertinent documentation to: ATTN: Division Director Division of Family and Children Services2 Peachtree Street NW, Suite 19.490Atlanta, GA 30303NOTE: If the Step Two Grievance is not filed within 10 business days of the response from the Step One Grievance, the grievance is considered closed.3. Comply with any requests for additional information within three business days of receipt.4. Accept the outcome from the DFCS Division Director as final and determinative of all issues.Comply with any requests for additional information within three business days of receipt. The ILS will:Acknowledge receipt of a Step One grievance in writing (i.e. email).Investigate the grievance [i.e. staff with all pertinent individuals, including Child Placing Agency (CPA) personnel] and try to resolve all concerns during Step One of the grievance process.Within 10 business days of receiving the complaint, send a written response to the youth indicating the proposed resolution or decision reached.Upon request, assist the youth with filing a Step Two grievance.Within three business days, comply with any requests from the office of the DFCS Division Director for additional information.Accept the outcome from the DFCS Division Director as final and determinative of all issues. The DFCS Division Director or designee will:Acknowledge receipt of a Step Two grievance in writing (i.e. email).Investigate the grievance and request additional information as needed.Within 15 calendar days of receiving the complaint, determine what if any corrective action is warranted on the part of DFCS or the CPA.Formally conclude the grievance process by notifying all parties of the final decision. Page 4 of 4 PRACTICE GUIDANCERights and ResponsibilitiesThe discussion of youth rights and responsibilities should occur in a manner that is most effective for each individual youth. During the discussion, words and terminology that make sense to the youth should be used. The case record should be documented if a child has cognitive, physical or behavioral challenges that would prevent the youth from fully appreciating the rights and responsibilities presented. A description of a related challenge or limitation should be recorded in SHINES. Right to Information Regarding Heritage and Cultural BackgroundChildren who indicate that they are not aware of the racial identity and/or religious preference of their parent(s) should be provided with such information if known. Youth should be provided opportunity to participate in age and developmentally appropriate, cultural activities when possible. Right to Know Why They are in the Foster Care SystemYouth should be encouraged to exercise their rights to participate in case plan development and attend juvenile court proceedings where reasons for foster care entry are addressed. Youth may also consult with their Social Services Case Manager (SSCM), Guardian Ad Litem (GAL) and/or Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) regarding reason(s) for removal from their parent or guardian. NOTE: Youth may NOT receive a copy of the related investigation or any other case record documentation that would violate laws regarding confidentiality as outlined in O.C.G.A 49-5-41. Grievance ProcessThere may be occasions in which youth feel they have not been treated appropriately by their caregivers or case managers. A formal grievance procedure has been developed for such occasions. However, youth should first seek to address their concerns informally by talking to the offending person, whether it is a caregiver, case manager, or a member of a private agency's staff. If necessary, youth should address the matter with that person's direct supervisor. Youth may also seek to talk to their Guardian Ad Litem or CASA worker. Youth should continue to seek resolution of their concerns through informal measures until reaching the point where youth feel a formal grievance is required.Learning how to advocate for oneself is an important life lesson. We want to encourage youth to address their concerns in a constructive manner. The formal grievance process also affords youth the opportunity to learn how to accept decisions made by those entrusted with the authority to make them (e.g. parents, teachers, employers, judges, etc.). Moreover, the grievance process serves as a way for DFCS and CPAs to monitor business operations and customer service. We always need to know when someone or something within our system is not functioning properly so that necessary adjustments can be made.The rights and responsibilities outlined in this policy section were developed in collaboration with a group of youth who have been through Georgia's foster care system and now serve in an advisory capacity.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-13-independent-living-program-section-137-youth

The law also includes the provision that the youth receives assistance in interpreting the credit report and resolving any discrepancies. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) amended this provision to increase the requirement for credit reports for youth in care to begin at age 14. The youths credit report must be generated from all three (3) credit reporting agencies and reviewed every 12 months from age 14 thru age 18 as long as the youth remains in foster care. Georgia law (O.C.G.A. 10-1-914) allows for additional protection for consumers under the age of 16 for whom a guardian has been appointed. All youth, in or out of foster care, should be educated on the importance that credit history plays in their lives. Youth should be well informed and understand:The information contained in credit reports is used to evaluate applications for loans, cell phones, cable, utilities, credit cards, insurance, employment, purchasing a car or home, renting an apartment, etc.Regular monitoring of their credit report is important to ensure information is accurate, up-to-date, and to prevent identity fraud.Once a youth reaches 18 years of age they can request their own annual free credit report at www.AnnualCreditReport.com.If they have a less than favorable credit score, they can be denied many of the aforementioned services, be asked for a large deposit to cover the cost of a service, or be denied employment opportunities.The importance of correcting discrepancies and/or negative information on the credit report when they are first discovered.The importance of protecting their identity and ways to protect their personal identifying information such as social security numbers and birth dates, etc. Identity Theft (also referred to as Identity Fraud)Identity Theft/Fraud occurs when someone uses your identifying information, like your name, Social Security number or credit card number, without your permission, to commit fraud or other crimes. Some examples of identity theft include, but are not limited to, the following:Credit card accounts that the youth has not opened;Utility bills in the youths name created prior to the youth residing on their own, in their own home;Car purchases if the youth does not have a vehicle;Recurring electronic payments that are set up using the youths debit or credit card information; orThe filing of income taxes using the youths information. All youth need to be aware that fraud or identify theft can occur in multiple ways such as by placing card readers or skimmers on ATM machines or gas pumps. Similarly, thieves arealso able to use handheld devices, or hack into online accounts to obtain credit or debit card information from consumers, including personal identification numbers (PIN). Foster youth are at even greater risk of identity fraud due to the number of individuals that have access to their personal information, such as birthdates or social security numbers. As such, in addition to having an awareness concerning their personal information and finances, youth also need to know that if they find that their ATM or Debit card information has been used without their permission, their bank should be contacted immediately to assist the youth in deactivating their account information and assist in the recovery of funds. For more information on identity theft or fraud, visit Consumer Information-Protecting Your Identity. Initial Fraud AlertWhen discrepancies are noted on a consumers credit report at least one of the three credit reporting agencies should be contacted and a request made to place a fraud alert on the consumers credit history. If an initial fraud alert is placed on an account, potential creditors must verify a persons identity before extending credit. Initial fraud alerts are free and remain in effect for 90 days. An extended fraud alert may also be placed on a consumers credit history if requested and remains in effect for seven years.NOTE: Each credit reporting agency that receives a request to initiate a fraud alert is required to notify the other two agencies in order that they also place a fraud alert on the consumers credit history. Federal Government Consumer Credit Protection and Assistance AgenciesThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is the nation's consumer protection agency. The FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection works to prevent fraud, deception, and unfair business practices in the marketplace including enforcing the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) with respect to the nations consumer reporting agencies  Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. The FCRA requires these agencies to provide consumers with free copies of their credit reports, upon request, once every 12 months. The FCRA promotes the accuracy and privacy of information in the files of the nations consumer reporting companies. A credit report includes information on where you live, how you pay your bills, and whether you have been sued or arrested, or have filed for bankruptcy. Nationwide consumer reporting companies sell the information in your report to creditors, insurers, employers, and other businesses that use it to evaluate your applications for credit, insurance, employment, or renting a home. An FTC informational brochure entitled Facts for Consumers is located at Consumer Information-Free Credit Reports National Identity Theft Victim Assistance Network (NITVAN)The National Identity Theft Victim Assistance Network is funded by the United States Department of Justice and is a resource that offers victim compensation and assistance throughout the United States. In addition, NITVAN offers programs to service providers in order to enhance their ability to assist identity theft victims. WTLP GoalCredit reporting goals are required to be added to the WTLP. Once included in the WTLP, the two goals related to credit reporting must be completed within the next six months in which they were included or prior to the next WTLP update.Youth Age 18 and Older Participating in the Extended Youth Supportive Services (EYSS) ProgramAlthough the requirement to obtain a credit report for youth in foster care ends in Georgia when the youth turns 18, the SSCM should assist youth participating in the EYSS program in obtaining their own annual free credit report online at www.AnnualCreditReport.com.NOTE: AnnualCreditReport.com is the only authorized source for the free annual credit report that adults can obtain pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act. For adults to obtain a free credit report online annually:Go to www.AnnualCreditReport.com;Select State and click ""Request Report"";Complete the form - including Social Security number, date of birth, etc.;Click ""Continue"" which will navigate to a page that lists all three reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion);Click the check box for all three names;You will be led through each agency;The reports can be reviewed, saved and printed;NOTE: The FREE credit report is only available ONCE per year (additional reports will cost). As such, try to establish a good time to do the credit reports annually  such as birthdays, etc. The reports will also provide information on what to do to resolve any false or inconsistent information. FORMS AND TOOLSAnnual Credit Reporting.com College Credit for LifeConsumer Credit Basics PowerPoint Consumer Information-Free Credit Reports Consumer Information-Protecting Your Identity Credit Report Request for Youth in Foster Care Credit Reporting Court Order ExampleFederal Trade Commission How to Get Your Credit ReportNational Identity Theft Victim Assistance Network (NITVAN)Taking Charge: What to do if Your Identity is Stolen Understanding How Credit Reporting WorksYouth Acknowledgement of Credit Report Receipt",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-13-independent-living-program-section-136-credit
GA :: Child Welfare Policy Manual :: Chapter 13 Independent Living Program :: Section 13.5 Individual Development Accounts (IDA),Georgia,Rules,"2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015","Administrative process, Forms - Other, Services while in care - Financial, Services while in care - Other",,,"REQUIREMENTS The Division of Family and Children Services (DFCS) shall:Offer any youth that meets the eligibility requirements the option to open a matched savings account known as the Individual Development Account (IDA).

If match funding is not available, existing participants will be notified in writing, and future participants will be notified during the IDA sign-up process. If funding becomes available later, participants will be informed in writing at that time of the new availability of matching funds.Allow eligible youth to make emergency withdrawals of IDA funds that are not qualified asset purchases on a case-by-case basis. Emergency withdrawals shall only include funds deposited by the applicable youth and shall not include any DFCS matching funds.Periodically review the participation of youth enrolled in the IDA program to determine their level of engagement.NOTE: The ILP Business Operations Specialist (BOS) shall exercise administrative oversight authority over Individual Development Accounts.PROCEDURES Determining Eligibility for an IDA and EnrollmentThe Social Services Case Manager (SSCM) or Independent Living Specialist (ILS) will:Verify that the youth is between the ages of 16-21, and enrolled in the Independent Living Program;Confirm that the youth satisfies the requirements of the financial institution, including the following:a.

Emergency withdrawals may be approved for day-to-day living expenses such as food, bills (in the youths name), prescriptions for the youth or the youths child, clothing for school or work, etc. When contacted by the ILS with an approved request for an emergency withdrawal of IDA funds, the ILP BOS will:Inform the appropriate banking institution that the youth has been approved to withdraw funds, including the specific amount that has been approved for withdrawal from the IDA account; andProvide the bank and youth with the appropriate documentation to release the funds.  Monitoring Youths Participation in the IDA ProgramDuring periodic reviews of a youths engagement in the IDA program the SSCM or ILS will:Discuss IDA contributions and/or withdrawals during monthly contacts, as part of the Written Transitional Living Plan (WTLP) discussion, or at other meetings.For youth ages 18-21 who are not participating in the EYSS program, contact the youth at least every six months to discuss the youths contributions and/or withdrawals to their IDA account;Contact the ILP BOS at least every six months to discuss the balance in the youths IDA bank account and any contributions or withdrawals that occurred during this period; andDocument the youths participation, level of engagement and IDA account status in Georgia SHINES, the Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information System. In order to allow as many youth as possible to actively participate and benefit from the IDA program, the ILP BOS will:Review the IDA program participant rolls at least once per year to determine if current enrollees are actively engaged in the program and contact their SSCM or ILS if participation issues are noted.Remove IDA program participants from the active roster and ensure their IDA is closed if any of the following has occurred:A youth has reached their savings or asset purchase goals;DFCS has met the match contribution maximum of $1,000;A youth has not made a deposit beyond DFCS participation incentive funds for nine months after the account was opened;A youth has kept an account open for at least nine months with no deposit activity in the most recent six consecutive months.Mail a certified to the last known address of the youth to inform them of their account status and offer an opportunity to discuss the account status prior to the closing of the account;Update the records, file all correspondence into the participants file, and proceed with closure of the IDA if the youth does not respond to the certified letter within 30 calendar days, or notifies the ILP BOS of their desire to proceed with closing the IDA.NOTE: Youth who are removed from the active participation roster are not eligible to re-enter the IDA program for a period of at least one year. However, they maintain access to the funds in their account after the closure of the IDA. RACTICE GUIDANCEOverview of the Individual Development Account ProgramThe IDA program helps eligible youth, that are either in or transitioning from foster care, to accumulate assets. The IDA helps ensure they have the resources needed to begin living on their own as adults. The IDA is established at a financial institution within the community and is opened in the name of the youth. The account earns interest, usually at the banks savings rate. Withdrawals from the account may only occur with the approval of the IDA administrator, which is the ILP BOS. As the administrator for the IDA program in Georgia, the ILP BOS is responsible for monitoring the programs activities, tracking participation at orientations and financial literacy trainings, processing match and incentive funds, and all other administrative functions of the program. The SSCM and ILS are responsible for informing eligible youth about the benefits of the IDA program, supporting their participation and trouble-shooting any issues with opening bank accounts, making regular deposits, understanding asset purchase requirements or requesting matches. ILP encourages all enrolled youth to participate in the IDA program to the fullest extent possible. However, some participants are unable to continue their participation or become disinterested in continuing the program for a variety of reasons. When youth reach their savings or asset purchase goals, or discontinue participation in the IDA program, the IDA is closed with DFCS. However, the youth maintains access to the remaining funds in their account. Individual Development Account (IDA) Asset GoalsThe goal of the IDA program is to help youth transitioning to adulthood to accumulate the assets they will need to become self-sufficient. The IDA program accomplishes this by presenting opportunities for youth to obtain matching funds from DFCS (up to $1,000) to reach savings or asset goals. When determining if an asset goal is an acceptable for the Georgia ILP IDA program, two general guidelines are applied:Economic self-sufficiency: the goal should enable participants to sustain themselves as they transition to self-sufficiency.Value appreciation: Investment goals should likely increase in value, or provide enhanced usage for the youth, over time. When youth become eligible to participate in the IDA program, they indicate which asset they plan to purchase with the funds in their IDA on the Georgia Youth Opportunities Initiative Application. Once the youth has saved their portion of the cost of the asset, the youth must complete the Asset Purchase Intent Form, which describes the specific asset for which the youth is requesting matching assistance to purchase. Common asset purchases qualifying for DFCS matching funds include, but are not limited to:Purchasing a vehicle;Car Insurance/Repairs;Investments;Housing;5. Educational expenses;Health and dental care;Microenterprise; andCredit building.The ILP BOS may approve matching funds for assets not listed above, on a case-by-case basis.IDA OrientationThe orientation required for IDA eligibility includes:An overview of the application process and legal documentation requirements such as a government issued photo ID card or Drivers License; (Youth must bring their ID to the orientation if available);Discussions around the youths commitment to and understanding of the IDA savings/matching process;The process for opening a bank account, including the financial institutions account opening requirements and record check systems such as the CHEXSystem reporting service. Youth that are identified in the CHEXSystem as having a negative banking record must attend a class offered by the banking institution in order to resolve the negative banking history prior to enrolling in the IDA program.Expectations regarding financial literacy training, and options for attending upcoming training courses;Explanations of financial incentives provided at various checkpoints during the participation in the IDA program;IDA specifics, such as the amount and frequency of deposits, desired goal amount (maximum), purpose of the account, matching fund ratio, authorized withdrawal purposes, and beneficiary information;Developing a plan to open a bank account within 30 calendar days of the completion of the IDA orientation; andCompletion of the Georgia Youth Opportunities Initiative Application. Participation Incentives (See COSTAR Manual for specifics and official amounts)In addition to matching youth deposits, incentive dollars can be earned by the youth and deposited into their respective IDA. Incentives include the following:Financial Literacy Training Incentive;IDA Savings account match;Seed PaymentIDA Survey IncentivesIDA Incentives Opportunity Passport SurveysThe IDA program is a component of the Georgia Youth Opportunities Initiative (GYOI). Along with participants in other states Georgia ILP youth participating in the IDA program will complete surveys as a part of the national database. The purpose of the surveys is to learn more about the impact of the program and whether it has made a difference to participants in the areas of permanency, education, employment, financial capability, housing, physical and mental health, and social capital.

Review and approve the Transition Plan.Review the case record to ensure required documents are available for issuance to the youth prior to exit from foster care. PRACTICE GUIDANCETransition PlanningThe Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 outlines provisions for a transition plan for youth within the 90 days preceding their 18th birthday and eventual exit from foster care. Transition planning should begin on day one of a childs placement into foster care and occur over the life of the case. Transition plans help youth in foster care make a successful transition to adulthood. Successful transition plans consider the youths age, skills and abilities. It should be developed in a manner thatallows the youth to see the value of the plan as they transition out of foster care, and to ensure the youth understands it and will refer to it as a resource.The transition plan is personalized and youth-directed and include services and resources that help ensure youth are prepared to make healthy decisions about their future. Youth, like adults, are more likely to assume ownership of a plan they participated in developing. Therefore, SSCMs should actively engage youth in the development and implementation of their transition plan to ensure its success. The transition plan must be as detailed as the youth chooses. All identified needs must be resolved or near resolution by the 90th day prior to the youths exit from foster care. While case planning/permanency planning is DFCS ongoing efforts to transition youth out of foster care to a permanent living situation, transition planning is the youths plan for after foster care if they have not achieved permanency. It describes where youth will live, how they will support themselves and other immediate daily living goals that must be met, beginning day one of their exit from foster care. Special consideration must be given to undocumented immigrant youth in foster care approaching age 18. In accordance with the Georgia Immigration and Security Act, no state or local government funding is available for undocumented immigrant children once they reach 18 years of age unless/until they obtain a legal immigration status. Therefore, unless the youth has a legal status, they will not be able to participate in EFC. TRANSITION PLANItemConsiderations for the Transition PlanHousingWhat does the youth need to achieve their housing goals?Where does the youth currently live?Do they plan to move?Would the current placement still be available once DFCS services end?Where would they live if their current housing fell through?Does the youth have a backup housing plan?How will the youth handle start-up costs for housing if moving?What about furniture, linens, and other housing essentials?Does the youth understand leases, rental applications, and the legal rights of landlords and tenants?For those young adults in college dormitories, where will they live when dorms are closed?EducationIs the youth attending school?

The ILS will:Meet with the youth to review the WTLP periodically (at minimum quarterly from the date of development) to assess youth progress and appropriateness of IL supported services;Partner with the youth and their identified support system to update the WTLP annually (at a minimum) based on the youths progress toward goals and the assessed appropriateness of services being provided to the youth.Acknowledge and celebrate tasks completed and outcomes achieved; andParticipate in Court or County Panel Reviews of youth supports and services. The ILS will:Participate in the FTM or TRT (as available) held for the purpose of updating the Case Plan/WTLP.Review all WTLPs developed with youth in their service area to ensure:The initiation, maintenance and appropriateness of services supported by ILP funding;The contents of the WTLP addresses reporting requirements for the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) (see policy 13.13 Independent Living Program: National Youth in Transition Database);Plans developed at the Transition Staffing 90 days prior to a youths 18th birthday contain specific options for:housinghealth insuranceeducationlocal opportunities for mentorscontinuing support serviceswork force supportsemployment servicesNotify the SSCM and SSS of any NYTD reporting requirements absent from the WTLP within 72 business hours of review. The SSS will:Participate in the FTM or TRT;Review the SSCMs documentation in Georgia SHINES and conduct a staffing to discuss the youths progress on the WTLP outcomes and any potential changes that need to be made in the WTLP;Ensure that the WTLP has been reviewed with the youth prior to any review or permanency plan hearing completed by the juvenile court and a copy of the WTLP has been provided to the youth;Ensure that both the Youth Detail Report and Youth Detail Reporting Page has been accurately updated to reflect the services and support the youth is receiving; andReview and approve any changes that are made to the WTLP on an ongoing basis. Developing, Reviewing, and Amending the WTLPDeveloping the WTLPAssisting a youth in the development of a transition plan that is actionable and self-directed begins with a quality assessment. Prior to drafting a plan the SSCM or ILS should be aware of the reason(s) the youth is in foster care and the possible trauma implications associated with those reasons. A review of pertinent case documentation is essential in gaining insight to:The childs maltreatment history and surrounding circumstances;How the parents or caregivers function with respect to daily life management including management of tasks associated with parenting a teenage child;How the child manages tasks associated with their developmental stage (early, middle or late adolescence) - specifically, how the child functions physically, cognitively and emotionally on a daily basis to include self-regulation / impulse control, problem-solving, relational skills / social competencies, self-efficacy and involvement in positive activities;Who and what serve as supports for the child (identify any caring adults, positive peers, parents and/or substitute caregivers who possess parenting competencies; community based supports such as the school environment, place of worship, and place of employment as applicable) The SSCM/ILS should meet with the youth and caregiver to administer the Casey Life Skills Assessment (CLSA) to obtain additional information regarding the youths mastery of specific daily life skills such as cooking, shopping, cleaning, money management, self-care (nutrition, hygiene, medication management, personal safety) and career planning. At a meeting subsequent to the case file review and CLSA, the SSCM or ILS should meet with the child and caregivers to share assessment findings  the demonstrated assets or strengths and possible needs for the youths successful transition to adulthood. During the meeting the SSCM or ILS should also obtain the youths perspective concerning their strengths and needs. SSCM or ILS should consider utilizing the interviewing technique of normalizing to broach sensitive subjects and to reach a consensus regarding desired outcomes associated with those areas of challenge. Normalizing, a method of understanding a behavior challenge within the context of normal adolescent development, can help to create an environment for open, honest dialogue and prevent defensiveness on the part of the youth. Normalizing provides an opportunity for the worker to express understanding and empathy regarding a behavior without condoning any particular action.  For example: Presenting challenge: A 17-year-old periodically sneaks out of the home at night to spend time with a boyfriend. Possible Normalizing Language: Its not unusual for someone of your age to be involved in a serious relationship. I understand that you would want to spend time with someone who is important to you. Tell me what you like most about your boyfriend. Once the conversation is started, the worker can begin to explore other related issues that may need to be addressed in the WTLP such as personal safety, family planning and housing / placement stability. The SSCM and ILS will need to be familiar with adolescent development in order to use normalizing effectively (see Stages of Adolescent Development in Forms and Tools). The SSCM/ILC should convey to the child and caregiver the importance of formally documenting a transition plan that will address identified needs. Utilization of a formal process such as an FTM or TRT adds structure to the conversation - structure intended to help participants focus on the required plan elements. A FTM format is most appropriate for youth whose case plan goal is reunification as the youths parents must be involved in the transition planning discussion. A TRT is most appropriate for youth with a non-reunification case plan goal. As appropriate, a description of either the FTM or TRT process should be shared with the youth and caregiver as a method for devising the best possible plan. The SSCM/ILS shouldobtain the names and contact information of persons identified by the youth as his or her support system for participation in plan development. Youth have a legal right to participate in case plan development and to choose up to two members of the case planning team who are neither their foster parent nor caseworker. The date, time and location of the transition planning meeting should facilitate involvement of the youth and their supporters. During the FTM, TRT or other formal meeting conducted to develop the WTLP, the youth and their support team will identify individualized goals/outcomes and corresponding tasks that will support a successful transition. WTLP Outcomes and TasksOutcomes define the desired change or preferred conditions that must exist to facilitate a successful transition to adulthood. Outcomes should be individualized based on the assessed strengths and needs of the youth and must be:behaviorally specific,measurable,attainable,relevant to the successful transition to adulthood,time-limited,positively stated andwritten in clear and simple language Tasks define detailed, sequential steps that advance the youth toward the achievement of a specific outcome. Tasks are those activities that identify who will do what, when, how often and where. For example: Outcome: Angela will complete all requirements for high school graduation by May 20th. Task: Angela will attend Spanish tutoring three times per week (M/W/TH), 3:00  4:00 p.m. at Central H.S.Task: ILS, Ms. Jones, will meet with Angela and FPs, Mr. & Mrs. Stevens, within 90 days to explain how to access financial supports available through ILP to assist with fees related toH.S. graduation.Task: Angelas mother, Ms. Clark, will attend Central H.S. Open House scheduled March 12th to meet Angelas teachers and to determine the number of remaining credits and other requirements needed for Angela to graduate.Task: CASA, Ms. Gerber, will coordinate and accompany Angela on local college campus visits quarterly when Angela receives passing grades in all courses. NOTE: Tasks should NOT be assigned to individuals who do not participate in the transition planning meeting. Youth should be assigned age and developmentally appropriate tasks. Reviewing the WTLPA regular review of WTLP progress must be conducted by the SSCM for youth participating in EYSS. The ILS must conduct reviews for youth no longer in foster care but eligible and receiving ILP support. Monthly purposeful contacts with the youth by the SSCM serves as an opportunity to engage youth concerning the agreed upon goals and steps detailed in the plan. ILS should review WTLP progress during quarterly contact with those youth who are no longer in DFCS custody.Amending the WTLPThe same process of engagement utilized to develop the initial WTLP should be employed to formally review and update or amend the plan. SSCM or ILS (as appropriate) should meet with youth and their identified support system as WTLP goals are achieved or issues arise that may require an amendment of the WTLP. For example, if it is determined that a youths grades have declined dramatically, the SSCM or ILS should engage the youth, collaterals and the youths support team to determine the root cause of the decline. The SSCM or ILS should reach a new consensus with the youth concerning required outcomes and related tasks based on the new information. The WTLP must be modified to reflect changes including services and supports. If additional services are initiated, updates should also be documented in Georgia SHINES on Youth Detail Reporting Page under the service categories (see policy 13.13 Independent Living Program: National Youth in Transition Database). Whether initiating or updating a plan, it is important that the youth assumes ownership of the goals and steps contained in the WTLP. Engagement should extend beyond the youth to the adults identified by the youth as allies or supporters. Efforts should be made to secure a commitment from the youth support system to provide assistance toward achieving the goals and steps in the WTLP. Partnerships will help lead to successful outcomes. Action PlanWhen appropriate, develop a corresponding Action Plan to overcome potential barriers to outcomes outlined in the WTLP. Like the WTLP, the Action Plan is a problem-solving tool intended to achieve outcomes, however the Action Plan differs from the WTLP as it drills down on specific tasks within the plan that may prove problematic for the youth based on their assessed level of functioning. The Action Plan should assist youth and their support system to:Identify those difficult situations or tasks that the youth must manage to achieve outcomes / goals;Identify early warning signs or unproductive behavior or signs that a youth is off track related to goal achievement;Include steps for the youth to prevent a loss of focus and direction;Identify measures the youth can take to interrupt or escape unproductive behaviors and re-focus in the event the youth does lose sight of their goals. For Example:WTLP Outcome: Christopher will increase safety for himself and others by reducing the number of outbursts and altercations that occur in the home and community.WTLP Task: Christopher will participate in trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy (TF-CBT) sessions twice per week to learn coping strategies for managing difficult emotions such as depression, anger and frustration.WTLP Task: Behavior Aide, Mr. Peters, will pick-up Christopher from school Tuesday and Thursday for transport to and from therapy sessions.WTLP Task: Therapist, Ms. Carter, will help Christopher identify (verbally describe) thoughts and feelings that trigger moods swings.WTLP Task: House Parent, Mr. Steele, will use a calendar to record the dates and times that Christopher appropriately responds to negative behavior triggers.Christophers Stay Calm and Carry On Action Plan Difficult / High Risk SituationRiding home on the school bus with peers and getting teased Warning Sign(s)Feeling hot, heart beats faster, body becomes tense, mouth becomes dry Prevention PlanSit in a seat close to the bus driver or bus monitor Sit with a friend on the busInterruption PlanIf I cant sit next to the bus driver, monitor, or a friend on the bus and someone begins to tease me, I will wait until it is safe then move to another seat away from the person teasing. And/or I will use earbuds to listen to music and try to ignore the teasing.Escape PlanIf I am on the bus and begin to sense warning signs of anger or frustration, I will tell the bus driver or monitor how I am feeling and ask for help. Regular reviews of the action plan should be conducted to assess how the youth is progressing toward goal achievement. The Action Plan is a fluid document that should be amended regularly to reflect accomplishments and to address setbacks. Transition Roundtable (TRT)The TRT is a youth-centered, structured, case consultation convened for the purpose of developing individualized plans to address legal permanency, permanent connections, housing, health insurance/health needs, education, employment and life skills. TRTs are most appropriate for youth 16 years of age and older with a non-reunification case plan goal (adoption, guardianship or APPLA) but may be utilized with youth as young as 14. A transition meeting is required for all youth in foster care at age 17. The resulting transition plan should be reviewed when the youth is 17 and 6 months and again at 17 and 9 months (90 days prior to their 18th birthday) to meet requirements of the Fostering Connections Act, see policy 13.4 Transition From Foster Care for the full list of items that must be addressed at the 90-day meeting. The TRT is a recommended tool to achieve compliance. Youth guide and inform the meeting with help from a facilitator who assists the team in identifying supports and services that meet the individualized needs of the youth. Resulting goals and action steps are incorporated into the youths WTLP. Prior to the transition roundtable, youth should participate in a Preparation Meeting conducted by the SSCM, ILS, Adult or Peer Advocate to:Discuss the TRT purpose and six-phase process;Explore how youth are managing activities and tasks related to their developmental stage - noting any challenges as well as areas where they are performing well (case documentation and the CLSA may be used to facilitate this conversation);Reach a consensus regarding individual level outcomes the youth hopes to attain;Identify significant people in their lives or permanent connections who can participate in their meeting; andAgree on a meeting location and time that would be convenient for the youth and their supporters. TRT team participants will vary based on the needs and wishes of the youth however the youth must always be present unless there is a compelling reason (e.g. incapacitating disability, resides out of state). Use technology (teleconferencing, Skype / video conference) to engage relevant team members who are unable to attend in person. Other team members should include:Allies / Support System invited by the youth  In addition to responsible, committed, adults, youth are permitted to invite siblings or peers (boyfriend / girlfriend) who may serve as a support and/or positive influence during transition.Youths current caregiver (kinship caregiver, foster parent, provider) unless youth says no.NOTE: If the caregiver is unable to attend for any reason, a conversation should be held in advance of the TRT to obtain their perspective on the youths day to day functioning and management of age and developmentally appropriate tasksYouths Social Services Case ManagerSSCM SupervisorIndependent Living SpecialistTherapist / Treatment Provider / Amerigroup Care Coordinator (if the youth has unmanaged mental health needs or developmental disabilities)Regional Adoption Coordinator (RAC) (if there is a Termination of Parental Rights (TPR) has occurred on at least one parent or there is a special request for a RAC to participate based on an anticipated TPR filing)Education Support Monitor (if the youth is below grade level or at grade level, but failing or youth has an IEP in place or youth is pursuing a GED) WTLP Development for Youth with Diagnosed DisabilitySpecial consideration and plannin",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-13-independent-living-program-section-133-written

Youth Capacity: When a youth's capacity is significantly diminished by a physical, emotional, or mental/cognitive disability, it is crucial to ensure they are properly represented in the transition planning process. If they cannot effectively engage due to their disability, representation should be provided by a parent, CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocate), GAL (Guardian ad Litem), or another identified advocate.
Collaborative Planning:

Interagency Collaboration: Effective WTLP development for youth facing disability-related challenges requires collaboration across multiple departments and agencies. Key collaborations should include:
DFCS Well-Being Services Section: To address overall well-being and specific health-related needs.
Amerigroup Care Coordinators: For healthcare planning and coordination.
Department of Aging Services (APS): For support services relevant to aging or adult services.
Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities (DBHDD): For mental health and developmental support services.
Department of Vocational Rehabilitation: To assist with employment and vocational training adapted to the youths abilities.
DFCS Placement Resource Operations (PRO) Unit: If specialized placement support is necessary.
Service Continuity:

The SSCM (Social Services Case Manager) and ILS (Independent Living Specialist) must ensure coordination with community agencies to continue needed services as the youth transitions into adulthood.
Documentation Requirements:

Youth Detail Page Report: Should document the youths disability and the extent of their limitations to inform appropriate support and service adjustments.
Forms and Tools
Safety Roundtables Six Phase Process: A structured approach to assess and plan for the safety and well-being of the youth throughout their transition.

Under no circumstances should the SSCM or caregiver complete the CLSA without youth participation.Within 30 calendar days of the youth 14-17 entering foster care or youth in foster care turning age 14:Review the CLSA results with the youth and determine together the appropriate steps, goals, and services to be included in the youths Written Transitional Living Plan (WTLP);Select yes on the Youth Detail Report page in Georgia SHINES to indicate the completion of the CLSA;Upload the CLSA into Georgia SHINES external documentation and label as the Casey Life Skills Assessment;Incorporate the results from the CLSA into the steps and goals outlined in the WTLP. Completing Subsequent Casey Life Skills AssessmentsWithin 60 calendar days of the youth in foster care reaching age 15 and 17, the SSCM will administer a Casey Life Skills Assessment by:Conducting a face-to-face meeting with the youth and his or her caregiver to discuss the assessment process;Accessing the website: www.lifeskills.casey.org/clsa_homepage and reviewing the assessment with the youth and caregiver;Having the youth complete the assessment online at: www.lifeskills.casey.org/clsa_homepage or on a hard copy (paper) version; NOTE: The same criteria concerning the youths ability to complete the CLSA with minimal assistance is applicable as with the initial CLSA. It is not necessary to complete a CLSA if it is determined that a CLSA was completed within 12 months of the child reaching age 15 or 17.Review the results of the subsequent CLSAs with the youth and caregiver and include the results into the WTLP with the youth. Incorporating Casey Life Skills Assessment Results with Youth Ages 18-21Within 15 calendar days of the youth agreeing to participate in the EYSS program, the SSCM will:Review the most recent CLSA results and compare with the youths most recent WTLP;Assess the youths current status and determine if a new CLSA is necessary in order to develop or revise the youths WTLP;Conduct a face-to-face visit with the youth:Discuss prior CLSA results and WTLP goals;If necessary, request the youth complete another CLSA and incorporate the results into the WTLP. Supervisory Review and ApprovalUpon completion of the initial and subsequent CLSA by the SSCM, the Social Services Supervisor will:Confirm that the CLSA has been completed and uploaded into Georgia SHINES External Documentation;Verify that the Youth Detail Page in Georgia SHINES has been updated to reflect completion of the CLSA; andWhen reviewing and approving the WTLP in Georgia SHINES, ensure the results from the CLSA have been incorporated into the steps and goals of the plan. PRACTICE GUIDANCECasey Life Skills AssessmentThe Casey Life Skills Assessment (CLSA) tool was developed by Casey Family Programs (Casey) from 1994-2000 as a tool for child welfare to assess the life skills of youth. The CLSA is not an exhaustive list of all the skills required to live independently; rather, it provides an indication of skill level and readiness for living independently. The assessments are designed as the first step in preparing youth to live on their own. Other steps include goal setting, action planning, instruction, learning, and application, followed again by ongoing assessments to measure progress. The Casey Life Skills Assessment and detailed information on how to complete the assessment may be accessed online at https://www.casey.org/casey-life-skills/. The life skills assessments provide instant feedback with customized learning plans. These plans provide a clear outline of next steps. The Casey Life Skills Assessment must be administered upon the youths entry in foster care and at ages 15 and 17. Results from the assessments will be used as a basis for the goals of the Written Transitional Living Plan (WTLP). The CLSA may be used more frequently as the WTLP is updated based the individual needs of the youth. Additionally, the CLSA may be used as a tool to assess a youth as he or she demonstrates they have mastered a particular skill. FORMS AND TOOLSCasey Life Skills Assessment Casey Life Skills Practice Guide",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-13-independent-living-program-section-132-casey-life

When a youth not in foster care or participating in the EYSS program requests ILP services the SSCM or ILS will:Determine if the youth meets ILP eligibility criteria within five business days of the youths request for ILP services by assessing the youths:Current contact informationCurrent and prior legal statusCitizenship statusDependency and/or CHINS information including:Name and date of birthCounty that held legal custodyGeorgia SHINES case record information (permanency plan, services provided, case outcome, etc.)Number of months in foster careIf eligible, document the specific ILP services the youth will be provided in the Written Transitional Living Plan (WTLP) (see policy 13.3 Independent Living Program: Written Transitional Living Plan and 13.11 Independent Living Program: Post Foster Care).PRACTICE GUIDANCEFair HearingsA fair hearing request may be completed by an individual, their representative or community based care provider when DFCS takes any action that affects participation in a federally funded service (Titles IV-E or IV-B under the Social Security Act). The fair hearing request may be based on the denial of assistance, delay in acting on a request for assistance or a reduction or termination of services provided (see policy 13.11 Independent Living Program: Post Foster Care Services). Independent Living Program Services for Ages14-21ILP services are flexible and individualized to the needs of each youth based on their Written Transitional Living Plan. Services include life skills workshops in a myriad of topics that address the development of skills and behaviors needed to support a successful transition to adulthood. Services may include financial assistance with secondary and post-secondary expenses such as high school graduation fees and college tuition; opportunities for socialization; and advocacy and support to assist the youth with establishing and pursuing personal goals. ILP placement and support services are also provided through RBWO providers who have specialized placement services through Independent Living and Transitional Living Programs (see policy16.3 Room, Board and Watchful Oversight: RBWO Placement Referral or 16.8 Room, Board and Watchful Oversight: RBWO Minimum Standards). Incarcerated YouthYouth that are incarcerated in juvenile detention facilities or county jails may still be eligible for ILP Services. For example, educational assistance that may help facilitate the completion of a General Education Diploma (GED) could be provided to the youth while he or she is incarcerated. To assist youth in continuing to work towards independence and the completion of the goals outlined in their WTLP, the SSCM should determine the services offered by the county jail or juvenile detention facility. If a youth is incarcerated in a county jail, the SSCM should contact the jail or the county sheriffs office. If a youth is incarcerated in a juvenile detention facility, the SSCM should contact the facility or the Georgia Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ). These facilities often have a counselor or case manager assigned to the youth; and collaboration with these individuals can assist in developing the appropriate plan for the youth while they are detained. The WTLP should be amended to reflect the available services that the youth can participate in and the responsible parties for implementation and monitoring the plan while the youth is incarcerated. Independent Living Specialist (ILS) and Social Services Case Manager (SSCM) PartnershipCritical to the youths success in creating, achieving and sustaining a successful transition to adulthood is the ongoing coordination of services and collaboration between the SSCM and the ILS. At the point ILP eligibility is established this partnership immediately becomes critical. The initiation of the Casey Life Skills Assessment and the creation of the Written Transitional Living Plan will be the foundation for the youth as they begin their transition from an in-home to an out- of-home placement as well as toward adulthood. While the ILS and the SSCM each have a different role in the youths life, both roles are critical to achieving successful outcomes. By collaborating at the beginning of the youths eligibility for ILP services the SSCM and the ILS are better able to assist the youth with information specific to their individual needs. In addition, the SSCM, ILS and the youth can work together to develop the goals a youth wants to achieve and work to identify what services are available in the community when the transition out of foster care back home or into adulthood occurs. For many youth who enter foster care this collaborative relationship helps to set up a foundational support system of appropriate and supportive individuals for the youth that he or she can reach out to in times of distress. This framework of support also provides the youth with an example of how to communicate effectively to achieve a common goal and can lead to the development of other supportive and nurturing relationships within the youths circle of family and friends who can continue to provide ongoing support through adulthood. Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children (ICPC) Youth EligibilityYouth under the age of 18 who currently are, or were formerly adjudicated as deprived or dependent by another state, who have either relocated or been placed in the state of Georgia through the Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children (ICPC) are the financial responsibility of the state from which they were adjudicated. The adjudicating state is responsible for funding independent living services, case planning, and any other financial assistance payments for the youth. Coordination of services for ICPC youth must be done through the state ICPC office. Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS)The Georgia Security and Immigration Compliance Act (GSICA) provides regulations concerning immigrants in Georgia who do not have a lawful US immigration status. It is unlawful for the Division of Family and Children Services to provide federal, state, or local benefits to undocumented immigrants and these regulations can directly affect youth that are discharged from foster care. In order to ensure that a youth exiting from foster care has availability to benefits as they transition into adulthood, any youth that enters foster care without lawful US immigration status should begin the application process for a lawful US immigration status, such as the Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS) immediately upon entering foster care. The SIJS application and approval process may take up to two years to finalize and SIJS must be attained prior to a youths 18th birthday to be eligible for continuing benefits. Youth Ages 18-21Youth ages 1821 that consent to continue to receive foster care assistance up to age 21, in the Extended Youth Support Services (EYSS) program may remain eligible to receive ILP services. When a youth reaches the age of 18 he or she may elect to remain in a foster care setting without interruption, and continue to receive independent living services if eligibility criteria was previously met. Those youth between the ages of 18-21 who have elected to exit foster care may request to return and participate in the EYSS program within six months, if the youth meets the basic months of exit but prior to age 21. Any requests beyond the six-month period for EYSS are subject to DFCS approval. Upon returning to the EYSS program eligibility criteria then they may receive ILP Services immediately. Youth between the ages of 18-21 who are not participating in the EYSS program may also be eligible for certain independent living program services, such as financial or educational supports. FORMS AND TOOLDepartment of Juvenile JusticeGeorgia Independent Living Program Notice of the Right to a Fair Hearing United States Citizenship and Immigration Services",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-13-independent-living-program-section-131-eligibility

Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (Foster Care Independence Act of 1999 (P.L. 106-169) DISCUSSIONThe Division of Family and Children Services (DFCS) shall utilize adoption assistance funding to facilitate the adoption of children with special needs who might otherwise not be adopted. The federal law requires efforts be made to place the child without adoption assistance, except when doing so is not in the childs best interest. Georgias Independent Living Program (ILP) provides eligible youth currently or formerly in foster care with services to successfully prepare and transition to adulthood. ILP services are designed to provide youth with the life skills and education necessary to become self-sufficient, live independently, and maintain stable employment. Services include life skills training, financial assistance, and educational and social support. Adolescence is a time of preparation for the future. Many adolescents leaving foster care have significant difficulty making a successful transition to adulthood. Congressional findings indicate children aging out of foster care show high rates of homelessness, non-marital childbearing, poverty, and delinquent or criminal behavior. They are also frequently the target of crime and physical assaults. The John H. Chafee Foster Care Independent Living Program (ILP) was created to support youth that are vulnerable to these conditions. The Independent Living Program goals are based on the federal legislation Foster Care Independence Act of 1999 (P.L. 106-169) also known as the John H. Chafee Foster Care Independence Program and are as follows:To identify children who are likely to remain in foster care until 18 years of age and to help these children make the transition to self-sufficiency by providing services such as assistance in obtaining a high school diploma, career exploration, vocational training, job placement and retention, training in daily living skills, training in budgeting and financial management skills, substance abuse prevention, and preventive health activities (including smoking avoidance, nutrition education, and pregnancy prevention);To help children who are likely to remain in foster care until 18 years of age receive the education, training, and services necessary to obtain employment;To help children who are likely to remain in foster care until 18 years of age prepare for and enter post-secondary training and education institutions;To provide personal and emotional support to children aging out of foster care, through mentors and the promotion of interactions with dedicated adults;To provide financial, housing, counseling, employment, education and other appropriate support and services to former foster care recipients between 18 and 21 years of age to complement their own efforts to achieve self-sufficiency and to assure that program participants recognize and accept their personal responsibility for preparing for and then making the transition from adolescence to adulthood; andTo make available vouchers for education and training, including postsecondary training and education, to youth who have aged out of foster care. Through family and community partnerships, the ILP program seeks the following outcomes for youth:Educational Attainment: Achievement of a High School Diploma, GED, completion of a secondary education program and opportunities for post secondary education;Employment: Financial self-sufficiency through employment and community service opportunities that allow the youth to develop job-readiness skills;Housing: Allowing youth to avoid homelessness;Health Care: Assuring the youth can meet their own physical and mental health needs by ensuring access to health insurance;Adult Connections: Ensuring the youth has permanent social connections with responsible and supportive adults; andAvoidance of High Risk Behaviors: Empowering youth to be productive and responsible members of the community. Georgias ILP provides services and opportunities for eligible youth in or out of foster care to maximize their potential and achieve a successful transition into adulthood. Independent Living Services include the following:ILP OrientationLife Skills and Supportive Services which contain information or supports related to:Academic Support;College Tours and Preparatory Workshops;Life Coaches;Financial Resources and Assistance;Post-Secondary Education Assistance;Career Preparation;Information on Maintaining Healthy Relationships;Self/Individual Supports;Health Education and Risk Prevention;Budgeting and Financial Management;Housing Education and Household Management; andLegal Matters.Secondary Education Program Services including assistance with:Tutoring;College Applications;Graduation Fees;Drivers Education; andACT/SAT testing.Post Foster Care Resourcesa. Transitional Living Supportive Services: This support is for youth, whether currently or previously in foster care, and is funded by the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) to assist with rental assistance, startup costs such as utility or rental deposits, life coaching, short term counseling and support group related expenses.b. Emergency Financial Assistance: This financial resource is also supported by the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program and is designed to prevent homelessness. Youth applying for emergency assistance will be offered time limited support services along with life coaching to assist them in maintaining self- sufficiency. Emergency Financial Assistance must be a qualified expense such as food, clothing, rent, medical costs or transportation.c. Education and Training Vouchers: The Independent Living Program funds Post- Secondary Financial Support services through the Federal Education and Training Vouchers (ETV) Program as well as State Independent Living Program college funding. Services that may be funded through these programs include application fees, registration fees, tuition, room and board, course books and supplies, tutoring, testing, and stipends for hygiene and personal maintenance.Graduated Independence: Allows youth in foster care (ages 14-17) or participating in the Extended Youth Support Services (EYSS) program (ages 18-21) to participate in age and developmentally appropriate activities to facilitate normalcy for youth receiving foster care services.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-13-independent-living-program-section-130

It establishes types, duration, amount(s) of benefits, and other agreed upon stipulations. A fully executed Adoption Assistance Agreement refers to an Adoption Assistance Agreement that was negotiated with the adoptive parent(s); reviewed and discussed with the adoptive parent(s); and all required signatures (adoptive parent(s), County Director/Designee and authorized department representative) and dates obtained. All required parties must sign and date the Adoption Assistance Agreement to indicate agreement with the assigned benefits prior to adoption assistance payments beginning. All signatures must be in place within 30 days of the adoption placement date and prior to finalization. For the children in the permanent custody of DFCS, the signing of the Adoption Assistance Agreement will be coordinated with the Adoption Placement Signing. For children not in the permanent custody of DFCS, such as private/independent adoptions, the review and signing of the Adoption Assistance Agreement will be executed prior to the finalization of the adoption. For foster parent adoptions, the adoption placement signing is often arranged for the beginning of a month to ensure continuity of payment for the child and to prevent duplicate payments from the foster care program funds and the adoption assistance program funds. The Adoption Assistance Agreement must only be launched from Georgia SHINES. Should there be difficulty launching the adoption assistance agreement, contact for assistance the Data Integrity Specialist (DIS), Georgia SHINES support personnel, and/or the Social Services Administration Unit (SSAU). If necessary, SSAU can manually create an Adoption Assistance Agreement for use at the adoption placement signing. If the issue persists, it may be necessary to postpone the signing if it does not cause a hardship to the adoptive family. Once the issue is resolved in Georgia SHINES attach and complete the adoption assistance agreement. DFCS recognizes the adoption of children by both members of a same-sex marriage, in accordance with the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges on June 26, 2015. Based on this ruling, both members of a same-sex marriage who are identified as the adoptive placement are allowed to sign the adoption assistance agreement. Until Georgia SHINES which generates adoption assistance agreements can be updated the name of one of the members of the same-sex marriage may be handwritten on to the agreement by a DFCS staff person, if done so prior to adoption finalization. The SSAU may be consulted regarding such cases and may generate an agreement outside of the SHINES system for signing, if requested to do so. Adoption (Private/Independent)There are four types of independent adoptions:1. Non-Relative (Third Party) - Adoption of a child usually arranged by an attorney, physician, or other individual with the direct involvement of the biological parents; if the child or adoptive parents reside in another state, the provisions of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children must be followed.Relative - Adoption of a child by a relative as defined as any relation by blood, marriage or adoption.Step-Parent - Adoption of a child by the spouse of one of the birth/legal parents where the other birth/legal parent is deceased or his/her parental rights have been terminated either voluntarily or by court action.Confirming Adoption (Domestication of Foreign Decree) - Adoption of a child who has already been adopted in a foreign country. The purpose being to secure a decree in the United States, which entitles the child to a Georgia birth certificate.Deferred Adoption AssistanceIf a child does not meet the eligibility criteria of a child with special needs prior to adoptive placement, but has background factors that may lead to significant medical, physical, or emotional problems in the future, a deferred Adoption Assistance Agreement is completed with the pre-adoptive parent(s). If significant medical, physical, or mental conditions develop at a later date, adoption assistance may be instated if it is determined by DFCS these developed conditions meet the special needs eligibility criteria. Deferred Adoption Assistance is only available for DFCS-involved adoptions. For adoptive parents who decide to voluntarily suspend adoption assistance benefits while their child receives SSI, the deferred Adoption Assistance Agreement may be used to designate the childs eligibility for adoption assistance benefits while receiving SSI and provide the opportunity to activate adoption assistance benefits at a later date (see policy 12.4 Adoption Assistance: Supplemental Security Income (SSI) & Adoption Assistance). Georgia Families 360ËOn March 03, 2014, DFCS transitioned from a standard fee-for-service Medicaid program to a statewide Medicaid Care Management Organization (CMO) through Amerigroup Georgia Managed Care Company. The transition impacted children in DFCS custody and children receiving adoption assistance as they became members of a new program called Georgia Families 360Ë which is separate from Georgia Families, the general Medicaid program administered by the Georgia Department of Community Health (DCH). Georgia Families 360Ë is designed to provide coordinated care across multiple services and focus on the physical, dental and behavioral needs of member children. The program is designed to ensure each member has a medical and dental home, access to preventive care screenings, and timely assessments. It also seeks to ensure medical providers adhere to clinical practice guidelines and evidence-based medicine. Families receiving adoption assistance have the option of enrolling in Georgia Families 360Ëor choosing fee-for-service Medicaid. Amerigroup Care Coordination Teams (CCT) and Care ManagersEach Georgia Families 360Ë member is assigned to a regional Care Coordination Team with a specified Care Manager. The CCT members are Masters level staff, the majority of whom hold a professional license to practice in their respective field. The CCT completes a Health RiskScreening (HRS) on youth in care to identify medical and/or behavioral needs. They ensure each child is assigned to a Primary Care Physician (PCP) and Primary Care Dentist so every child has a medical and dental home. The CCT is responsible for coordinating the health components of the Comprehensive Child and Family Assessment (CCFA), including the initial physical assessment, dental screening and trauma assessment. Care Managers are the primary partner of the SSCM for identifying and making referrals for needed services. Care Managers ensure each youth has an individualized care plan that addresses both physical and behavioral health needs. They work with community agencies to ensure appropriate services are provided. Any services not authorized by the CCT will not be paid for out of Medicaid. Therefore, it is imperative that all medical/dental, behavioral health and developmental care be coordinated with the CCT to avoid any uncovered expenses. FORMS AND TOOLSAdoption Assistance NarrativePost Adoption Services/Adoption Assistance Benefits HandoutPost Adoption Services/Adoption Assistance Benefits Handout - SpanishVerification of Receipt of Information Packet Regarding Post Adoption Services/Adoption Assistance BenefitsVerification of Receipt of Information Packet Regarding Post Adoption Services/Adoption Assistance Benefits - Spanish",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-12-adoption-assistance-section-126-reviewing-and

EXCEPTION: An adoption assistance application for a specialized rate in Georgia SHINES can be submitted following the approval of the adoption assistance application for basic rate when a child is later determined to have additional problems and treatment needs.An application for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits was submitted for the child and the Social Security Administration (SSA) has rendered an eligibility determination of either approved or denied. NOTE: This requirement only applies to children who are determined by the Revenue Maximization Unit (Rev Max) to have an adoption funding type of state- funded.A child who is in a DFCS foster home must be currently approved for a specialized foster care per diem by the Care Coordination Treatment Unit (CCTU) and have a current Memorandum indicating such. NOTE: If the child doesnt have a current specialized foster care per diem rate approval, an application for both a specialized foster care per diem rate and an adoption assistance specialized rate must be submitted simultaneously to both CCTU and Social Services Administration Unit (SSAU) with all supporting documentation. See policy 16.5 Room Board and Watchful Oversight: Specialized Foster Care Per Diem for procedures for submitting a request to CCTU for specialized foster care rate per diem.A child who is placed in a child placing agency (CPA) foster home is approved by CCTU for an additional Room Board and Watchful Oversight (RBWO) waiver amount, above the basic per diem, and has a current RBWO Program Destination Waiver indicating such.Ensure the assigned adoption specialized rate does not exceed the amount the child receives in a family foster home or for a child not placed in a family foster home, the adoption assistance rate does not exceed the rate the child would receive if he/she were placed in a family foster home. PROCEDURESThe Social Services Case Manager (SSCM) will:Provide the following required supporting information when submitting an adoption assistance application for a specialized rate to SSAU:For a child in a child care institution (CCI):RBWO memorandum from CCTU indicating the child is currently receiving a higher foster care rate; andA copy of the completed Universal Application.For a child in a CPA foster home:RBWO memorandum from CCTU indicating the child is currently receiving a higher foster care rate; andA copy of the completed Universal Application; andCaregiver Effort Declaration; orA signed written statement from the foster parent regarding the care requirements.For a child in a DFCS foster home:Specialized foster care per diem memorandum from CCTU indicating the child is currently receiving a higher foster care rate; andA copy of the completed Universal Application; andCaregiver Effort of Declaration; orA signed written statement from the foster parent regarding the care requirements. NOTE: The specialized foster care per diem memorandum is not required for a child in DFCS custody if the SSCM is submitting the application for specialized foster care per diem and the specialized adoption assistance rate simultaneously.d.

SSI applications may take up to four to six months for the Social Security Administration to process, and thus should be submitted to the SSA well in advance of specialized rate requests. This will prevent potential delays in the placement of children in adoptive homes. When applying for SSI benefits, the Social Services Case Manager must present documentation to the Social Security Administration as to whether the childs adoption funding type is state-funded or Title IV-E based on the Rev Max determination, because this has a significant bearing on the childs SSI eligibility. If a child in foster care who has a specialized adoption assistance rate moves to a different foster care placement resource or has a situation where the foster care rate becomes lower than the specialized adoption assistance rate, SSAU should be immediately notified so that the specialized adoption assistance rate can be adjusted or terminated in Georgia SHINES. The specialized adoption assistance rate will be re-applied for annually until adoptive placement occurs. These processes ensure that the adoption assistance rate does not exceed the foster home board rate, in accordance with Federal Title IV-E policy requirements. If at the time of submitting a request for adoption assistance specialized rate the RBWO waiver or specialized foster care rate approval will expire within 60 days or less, it is recommended that the Social Services Case Manager also re-apply for the RBWO waiver/specialized foster care rate (see policy 16.1 Room Board and Watchful Oversight: Program Designation and 16.5 Room Board and Watchful Oversight: Specialized Foster Care Per Diem for requirements and procedures on submitting a request for a higher foster care rate). Babies Can't WaitBabies Cant Wait is Georgias early intervention program for infants and toddlers with developmental delays and disabilities and their families. It is a federally-mandated program under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which provides a framework for coordinating developmental, educational, and community support within natural environments for children under three and their families. Basic Rate (Adoption Assistance)This is the basic monthly rate which is provided for children who qualify for adoption assistance. Child Care Institution (CCI)Child care institutions provide care, supervision, and oversight in a residential setting, including neighborhood-based group homes, campus-based arrangements, and self-contained facilities. Child Placing Agency (CPA)A CPA is a private agency that places children in foster homes for temporary individualized care, supervision and oversight in a resource family setting. CPAs make arrangements to assess the placement regarding the appropriateness of the room, board and watchful oversight that the prospective foster family will provide. The agencys employees and the CPAs foster parents work as a team to provide a stabilizing and nurturing environment that promotes safety, well-being and permanency. Individualized Education Plan (IEP)The Individualized Education Plan (IEP) is an individualized document designed for one student that guides the delivery of special education supports and services for the student with a disability. The IEP creates an opportunity for teachers, parents, school administrators, related services personnel and students (when appropriate) to work together to improve educational results for children with disabilities. Supplemental Security Income (SSI)Supplemental Security Income is a monthly benefit for persons who are disabled or who have functional limitations as determined by the Social Security Administration. The Universal ApplicationFor DFCS staff the Universal Application can be completed in Georgia SHINES in the FCC/ADO stage under the Placement Tab. Many of the fields on the Universal Application pre- populate with data already entered into Georgia SHINES. To take full advantage of this feature, prior to launching the Universal Application in Georgia SHINES, thoroughly complete the Person Detail, Health Detail, and Education Detail pages. For RBWO providers, the Universal Application must be completed outside of Georgia SHINES.

It is required that a family evaluation be completed on the prospective adoptive family by an evaluator prior to placement of a child for the purpose of adoption with a third party, who is neither a stepparent nor a relative, and for such family evaluation to recommend placement. A family evaluation, for purpose of a third party adoption, must assess the petitioners physical health, emotional maturity, financial circumstances, and family and social background and conform to the rules and regulations established by the DFCS for child-placing agencies for adoption home studies. In cases where DFCS is selected as the evaluator, a fee of $2,000.00 will be charged to the petitioners. Adoption Reunion RegistryThe Georgia adoption reunion registry provides services to birth parents, adopted persons, adoptive parents and siblings who are attempting to obtain non-identifying or identifying information from the sealed file.EvaluatorThe person or agency that conducts a family evaluation when a child is to be adopted by a (non-relative) third party. An evaluator shall be a licensed child-placing agency, the department, or a licensed professional with at least two years of adoption related professional experience, including a licensed clinical social worker, licensed master social worker, licensed marriage and family therapist, or licensed professional counselor. In instances where none of the foregoing evaluators are available, the court may appoint a guardian ad litem or court appointed special advocate to conduct the family evaluation. Family EvaluationA comprehensive evaluation of a family for the purpose of determining the suitability of the family as a prospective foster or adoptive resource. Independent AdoptionAn adoption arranged by a birth parent or other person or entity to take custody of and to place children for adoption. Private AgencyA licensed or state approved agency whether domestic or international that has been given legal authority to place a child for adoption. FORMS AND TOOLSFinancial Statement for Resource Parenting Financial Statement for Resource Parenting- SpanishRules and Regulations for Child Placing Agencies, Office of Regulatory Services Other Household Member Medical Evaluation ReportProspective Foster or Adoptive Parent Medical Evaluation Report",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-11-adoption-section-1124-independent-adoption-family

If a family approaches the county requesting that an adoptive family evaluation be completed for an out-of-state agency, inform the family that evaluations for out-of-state children are done by the county department and/or a private agency under contract with the state. The contract agency will only complete family evaluations if a specific child is identified and the complete ICPC packet has been submitted by the out-of-state agency holding legal custody of the child. The ICPC packet must contain evidence that the rights of both parents have been terminated or surrendered. If there is no specific child identified, refer the family to the Office of Regulatory Services (404) 657- 5562 for a list of current licensed private adoption agencies who can complete the required family evaluation. The receiving state is required to complete and return the results of a family evaluation within 60 days after the state receives the request. The education and training of foster parents is not required to be completed within the 60-day timeframe. If DFCS receives a request for an adoptive family evaluation and the out-of-state child is already in the home by means of an approved relative or foster care ICPC placement and DFCS is already supervising the placement, the Social Services Case Manager will continue to supervise that placement until notified by the ICPC Administrator that adoption is final and supervision can discontinue. When a pre-adoptive family moves to Georgia prior to finalizing the adoption and the child is in their home, DFCS will adhere to the ICPC process. If the family was working with a private agency in their former state, they will usually be referred to a private agency in Georgia to complete the adoption process. If the family was working with the state agency in their former state, DFCS will usually be asked to complete the process. Depending on the point in the adoption process at which the move occurs, the family may or may not be returning to their former state to finalize the adoption. FORMS AND TOOLSEntering Intakes  Georgia SHINES Job Aide ICPC Cover Letter  SampleInterstate Compact Report on Childs Placement Status (ICPC 100B)Interstate Compact Report on Childs Placement Status - Instructions (ICPC 100B-I) Interstate Compact Placement Request (ICPC 100A)Interstate Compact Placement Request  Instructions (ICPC 100A-I)",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-11-adoption-section-1119-placement-child-another

Occasionally, agencies in other states send legal papers directly to the county department. Forward any papers received to Georgias ICPC Unit for processing.  If Adoption Finalization Occurs In the Receiving StateFollowing finalization of the adoption, the ICPC Administrator will:Obtain from the receiving state's ICPC Administrator:A certified copy of the final decree of adoption; andInterstate Compact on the Placement of Children Report on Childs Placement Status (ICPC 100B) indicating that the adoption has been finalized in the receiving state and ICPC services are terminated; andNotify the Social Services Case Manager and the County Director/Designee that the adoption is final. The Social Services Case Manager will:Update the legal status to reflect the adoption finalization. NOTE: Updating the legal status in Georgia SHINES will notify the Adoption Exchange/State Permanency Unit by a system generate alert.Within ten business days of the adoption finalization, complete and sign the Adoption Assistance Memorandum indicating adoption finalization and obtain the Social Services Supervisors signature of approval. NOTE: The Adoption Assistance Memorandum should indicate the date of adoption finalization and the childs new name as it should appear on the Medicaid card.Forward the signed and approved Adoption Assistance Memorandum to:Rev Max;Regional Accounting; andSocial Services Administrative Unit.Prepare and submit the record for sealing and retention (see policy 2.3 Information Management: Adoption Case Record for the procedures for preparing an adoption record for permanent retention and to be sealed).NOTE: When Juvenile Court is the sending agency, the county department will submit a copy of the final decree of adoption along with a copy of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children Report on Childs Placement Status to the Juvenile Court. Juvenile Court will notify the county department of the termination of jurisdiction. PRACTICE GUIDANCEGeorgias ICPC Unit is the county departments point of contact in the ICPC process. The ICPC Unit utilizes Georgia SHINES to gather information for the packet. For each document included in the ICPC adoption packet on the Georgia SHINES External Documentation Detail Page, clearly identify the type of document, check the ICPC document box and associate the document with the relevant person. When communicating with the Georgia ICPC Unit, ensure to include the childs full name, adoptive placement resource name and Georgia SHINES/ICPC case number. Georgias DFCS staff is restricted from communicating with the receiving states child welfare agency/child placing agency (CPA) until the adoptive placement is approved through the ICPC process. When a child is already placed with an approved ICPC pre-adoptive family in another state on foster care status at the point the child becomes legally free for adoption, an ICPC adoption packet shall be submitted to the Georgia ICPC Administrator. The ICPC Administrator will request from the receiving state an updated home study, which would reflect information surrounding the adoption. At that point, authorization can be provided to the other state to proceed with the Adoption Placement Signing (see policy 11.9 Adoption: Adoption Placement Signing). Following are a few key ICPC points to take into consideration when submitting an ICPC request:All states do not recognize degrees of familial relations beyond the first degree.All states may not accept IMPACT certification.Proof of paternity (legitimation order, DNA results or child support court order) is required for all requests on fathers or paternal relatives. When custody has been given by a Juvenile Court Judge to relatives who reside out of the state of Georgia for the purpose of adoption, there has usually been ICPC correspondence to secure a family evaluation. The county department will usually know prior to the hearing that the relatives are recommended and that it is probable that custody will be granted. The county department may assist the court by completing the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children Request and have it available for the Juvenile Court Judge to sign. DFCS allows for a purchase of service payment in the amount of $5,000 per child to a licensed CPA agency for adoptive placement of a special needs child. Purchase of services can be used when DFCS has no suitable adoptive placement resource for a child or when an out-of- state CPA resource better meets the needs of the child. DFCS resources should be explored but may be considered concurrently with CPAs resources. Purchase of services funds may again be requested for a child if the placement disrupts and adoption dissolution occurs and another resource has been identified through an out-of-state CPA. Adoptive placements identified through an out-of-state CPA are subject to the ICPC process described in thissection. See Field Fiscal Services Costar Manual section 3004 Adoptions Programs: ICPC Foster to Adopt/Adoptive Home Study and Out of State Adoption Home Study, for the procedures to request funds and process purchase of service payments. Placement activities should not begin until the funding request has been approved by the county department. Adoption AssistanceAdoption Assistance is funding used to facilitate the adoption of children with special needs who might otherwise not be adopted. Adoption assistance is assistance provided on behalf of an eligible child to offset the costs associated with adopting and meeting the ongoing needs of the child. Adoption assistance can be provided in the form of payments, medical coverage and reimbursement of non-recurring expenses.Child Placing Agency (CPA)A CPA is an agency that places children in foster and adoptive resource homes for individualized care, supervision and oversight.

See policy 12.9 Adoption Assistance: Continuation, Renegotiation or Termination of Adoption Assistance Benefits for guidelines on terminating adoption assistance payments following dissolution of an adoption. PRACTICE GUIDANCEWhen it is necessary for an adopted child to enter care, it is best that only temporary custody be given to the county department to allow for a thorough evaluation of the situation and the establishment of an appropriate case plan to attempt to keep the adoption from dissolving.Adoption dissolution is the surrender or termination of parental rights of the adoptive parents of a child on whom an adoption has been finalized in court. The dissolution of an adoption is a very serious matter. DFCS shall not accept a voluntary surrender from the adoptive family unless there is reasonable knowledge that the child will be placed again into an adoptive home. Adoptive parents are legal parents once the adoption has been finalized. The agency does notretain any legal responsibility for the child once the adoption is finalized. Dissolution will renew separation, loss and rejection issues for the child. The child often blames him/herself for the dissolution, which, may or may not be valid. The child may be relieved that the adoption dis- solved and feel guilty about these feelings. It would be unusual for the child not to need therapy following dissolution. The adoptive family may express feelings of anger toward the agency and be unwilling to work in partnership with the agency towards resolution of problems. The adoptive family usually has great feelings of guilt that the adoption did not work and that they feel relieved it is over.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-11-adoption-section-1116-child-re-enters-foster-care

If the adopted or to-be-adopted child is 14 years of age or older, thechild is required to be a party to the post adoption contact agreement. The agreement can include, but is not limited to, provisions about birth relative(s) visitation with the child, sharing of information about the child or sharing of information about the birth relative(s). The post adoption agreement is not exclusive to the birth parent(s) but can include other biological relatives. A biological father, who is/was not also a legal father, and his relative(s), can also enter into a post adoption contact agreement. The post adoption contact agreement can be enforced, modified and/or terminated by the court that granted the petition for adoption. DFCS doesn't have the authority to enforce a post adoption contact agreement. If the birth relative(s) and/or the pre-adoptive or adoptive parent(s) desire to enter into a post adoption contact agreement, it is their responsibility to contact their attorney for further guidance. During adoption pre-placement staffing, the SSCM and the pre-adoptive parent(s) should thoroughly go over the benefits and challenges of entering into such an agreement (see policy 11.8 Adoption: Adoption Pre-Placement Staffing & Visitation). The SSCM should provide any answers that the pre-adoptive family may have about the birth family, ensuring only to disclose information permitted by HIPAA. The pre-adoptive parent(s) should be provided the opportunity to discuss this matter separately from DFCS and provide a decision to DFCS prior to the finalization of the adoption. While preparing the birth family for adoption, the SSCM should discuss the post adoption contact agreement with the birth parent(s). The SSCM should support the birth family in making their decision by answering any questions and creating a benefit and challenge list. The birth parent(s) and relatives should make the decision separate from the SSCM; however, they should inform the SSCM of their decision. Occasionally, when adoption is not voluntary on behalf of the birth parent(s), the birth relative(s) may direct their feelings of anger toward the adoptive parent(s). Not only are these feelings misplaced, it could diminish the possibility of entering into a post adoption contact agreement with the adoptive parent(s) or have an adverse impact on the parameters of the agreement. Besides the obvious benefits to the child, this is just one more reason birth relative(s) and adoptive parent(s) should develop a partnership. The SSCM should support and encourage this supportive relationship by setting up positive interactions between both parties whenever possible. While children are in foster care, the SSCM is also responsible for fostering the bond between siblings through visitation, discussion and other means. However, often times, after the adoption is finalized, the adoptive parent(s) doesnt sustain the same level of commitment for various reasons. The post adoption contact agreement can be a very powerful tool in maintaining sibling connections, as it can be developed to support contact between siblings' post adoption.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-11-adoption-section-1115-post-adoption-contact

It is reasonable to expect stress early in the adoptive placement and as finalization approaches. Since adoption is a life-long process, crisis can occur after finalization occurs. The Social Services Administration Unit contracts with a private agency whose goal is to preserve adoptive placements by providing crisis intervention services to families with a potential for disruption or dissolution of an adoptive placement or finalization. A team of skilled individuals work with families to assess and connect them to needed community resources. The services provided by the contract agency are short-term and are not meant to replace community services. Their function is to help families navigate these systems during challenging and stressful times. Referrals are accepted statewide. The Social Services Case Manager (in a non-finalized adoption) or the adoption assistance Social Services Case Manager (in a finalized adoption) willInitiate crisis intervention services for a family in a pre-adoptive or post adoptive stage by:Completing and forwarding the Crisis Intervention Team referral information to the Social Services Administration Unit for processing;Securing the appropriate release of information form prior to the contract agencys initial contact with the family;Providing copies of psychological and/or psychiatric evaluations and the Child Life History at the time of referral to the contract agency;Informing the family that the contract agency may be traveling substantial distances, and it is important that all family members be present for the initial home visit;Advising the family to take necessary steps to minimize disruptions during the initial home visit (e.g., eat dinner and complete homework beforehand; allow the answering machine to pick up phone calls, etc.); andExercising his/her own judgment in determining if the family would benefit from his/her presence at the initial home visit.Consult with the State Office as needed. PRACTICE GUIDANCEAdoption is a lifelong commitment by both the adoptive parent(s) and the adoptee. At all stages throughout his/her life, the adoptee and the adoptive family may have reoccurring issues around the adoption. It is vital that the agency be available to them whenever needed. The Regional Adoption Coordinator should be engaged in an exploration of availability of post- adoption services and resources when families call with a crisis or need. FORMS AND TOOLSCrisis Intervention Team Referral Form Georgia Center For Resources & SupportPost Adoption Services/Adoption Assistance Benefits HandoutPost Adoption Services/Adoption Assistance Benefits Handout - Spanish",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-11-adoption-section-1113-support-services-post

During the post-placement period, it is important that all visits occur in the home to allow for the best assessment of the adjustment of the family as a whole. During the visits, the SSCM shall continuously evaluate the family and interaction as to the following circumstances:The emergence of factors not previously identified (e.g., critical information not recognized by SSCM or family).Inaccurate assessment of family or child (e.g., capability or readiness of family or child to make an adoptive attachment, type of child family can parent).The emergence of unpredictable circumstances.Lack of preparation for placement of either child, family or both. It is the responsibility of the SSCM during the post-placement period to assist the pre-adoptive family as follows:Help the family cope with their new interactions within the home and community.Refer to resources in the community (see policy 11.13 Adoption: Support Services: Post Adoptive Placement & Post Adoption for a list of available resources).Make a referral to agency resources and/or initiate wraparound services.Assist with ongoing separation and attachment issues.Assist the family with maintaining connections with siblings, other birth relatives, foster parents and significant others.Help the family recognize, accept and manage the needs of the particular child(ren) in the placement.Assist the family to balance the needs of the child versus the needs of the parents.Help the family understand that attachment will not occur immediately.Help the child express and manage unarticulated fears.Help the family members learn to handle questions from extended family, neighbors, friends or community members, including development of a cover story if needed.Assist the family with methods of discipline for the childHelp the family use and maintain the Life Book.Help the parents to learn to separate adoption-related issues from normal issues relating to age and development.Encourage families to participate in ongoing training. Changes to a familys composition can affect the adoption in various ways. It is imperativethat family composition changes are reported. The familys evaluation will have to be re- evaluated to determine the effect the change in family composition poses to the child and whether another recommendation will need to be made based on the new family composition. In most circumstances, the SSCM who is making routine child visits in the home is the first to be made aware of the changes and should immediately report it to the Resource Development unit. Once a child is placed on adoptive status, no new placements should be made unless it is to facilitate the placement of a sibling of a child in the home. The length of time a family spends in the post-placement phase varies depending upon the child involved. The length of the post-placement period can be renegotiated at any point as necessary. The usual length of time is six months; however, the length of time will depend on a number of factors, including:Age of the childIssues/concerns identified pre-placementNeeds of the childAdjustment concerns during post-placement The post-placement supervision for an infant that does not have any physical, psychological or developmental needs can be considerably shorter as long as at least two monthly visits are made. Prior to the finalization of the adoption, it is important that the pre-adoptive family inform the agency of any problems that occur. If a petition seeking adoption of the child is not filed within six months, the court shall then, and at least semi-annually thereafter as long as the child remains unadopted, review the circumstances of the child to determine what efforts have been made to assure that the child will be adopted (see policy 17.2 Legal: Case Review/Permanency Plan Hearings for information on permanency reviews). The court may then enter such orders as it deems necessary to further the adoption including, but not limited to, another placement. FORMS AND TOOLSCreating and Using Life Books",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-11-adoption-section-1110-post-placement-supervision

The adoption pre- placement staffing shall be scheduled by the childs SSCM for the purpose of sharing information with the identified adoptive placement resource to assist the prospective adoptive family in making an informed decision regarding their interest in becoming an adoptive parent to the child. It is important that all involved parties are in attendance to ensure that a viable pre-placement plan is created for the child. Prior to the adoption pre-placement staffing, the SSCM and Social Services Supervisor should discuss the meeting format and decide which segment(s) of the meeting is appropriate (if not all) to have the foster parent(s) in attendance. When making the decision, it should be considered that the foster parent(s) has a lot of information about the child that could be useful. Pre-placement is the period of time during which the child and prospective adoptive family visit together through the Adoption Placement Signing. Significant holidays must be taken into consideration when scheduling pre-placement visits as holidays are not a good time to plan a move. In the ideal situation, the first pre-placement visit should occur in the foster home. The child needs time between visits to process the experience and deal with the idea of the move.After each visit, adequate time shall be given for discussing what occurred with the child and listening to his/her impressions and feelings. Adequate time shall also be given to review and explore the adoptive family's impressions and to allow for planning of the next visit. Pre- placement visits should not extend beyond two months. The SSCM should consult with the RAC if the pre-placement visitation is going to exceed two months. The foster parents can be a great help in facilitating a child's move into the adoptive family. The foster parent is a rich resource for the adoptive parent(s) and can provide information that would not be seen by a SSCM who is not in the home with the child. The foster parent(s) can provide information about the childs schedule, eating and sleeping routines, fears, functioning in the family, reaction to situations, etc. The foster parent(s) can also give information on techniques that they have found effective in managing the childs behaviors. It is important that the SSCM partner with the foster parent during this process. If the foster parent(s) views adoption as a positive move for the child, they will be able to help the child separate from them and easily transition into an adoptive family. Conversely, if the foster parent(s) do not view the adoption as positive, the child may have feelings of guilt over and feel anger toward the adoptive parents/DFCS for taking them away. The policy and practice discussed in this section are related to an adoptive placement other than the current foster parent(s). A foster parent(s) who has had a child in his/her home for a period of at least 12 months has the option of being considered as an adoptive resource for the child (see policy 11.6 Adoption: Foster Parent Adoption Consideration Evaluation). Adoptive StatusAdoptive status is the point when a child is legally free to be adopted, an adoptive resource has been identified, physical adoptive placement has occurred, and the adoptive resource has committed to be the child's adoptive parent(s) by signing the placement agreement(s). Placing a child on adoptive status signals recruitment procedures should be halted as a potential adoptive resource has been located for the child. Child Care Institution (CCI)Child care institutions provide care, supervision and oversight in a residential setting, including neighborhood-based group homes, campus-based arrangements and self-contained facilities. Child Placing Agency (CPA)A CPA is an agency that places children in foster and adoptive resource homes for individualized care, supervision and oversight. Child placing agencies are responsible for assessing the placement regarding the appropriateness of the room, board and watchful oversight that the prospective foster and adoptive families will provide. The CPAs employees and their foster and adoptive parents work as a team to provide a stabilizing and nurturing environment that promotes safety, well-being and permanency.De-Identified Child Life HistoryDe-identified information neither identifies nor provides a reasonable basis to identify an individual. FORMS AND TOOLSSummary of the HIPAA Privacy Rule",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-11-adoption-section-118-adoption-pre-placement

If a foster parent is married, both have to be willing to proceed with the adoption of the child and be a party to the petition. If separated both parties will need to be included on the petition to adopt the child or a legal divorce will be obtained prior to being able to proceed with adopting the child as an individual. When the foster parent(s) has expressed interest in becoming an adoptive resource a foster parent adoption consideration evaluation must be completed to assess the foster parent(s) ability to meet the long and short term needs of the child. Additionally, the protective capacities demonstrated by the foster parent(s) in relation to the childs particular vulnerabilities should be assessed and take into consideration whether an adoptive placement with the foster parent(s) is in the best interest of the child. For guidance, review the structured narrative guideline available in Georgia SHINES under the Foster Parent Conversion tab. The foster parent adoption consideration evaluation should be used to reassess whether the caregiver(s) continue to be able to meet needs of the child any time there is a major change (e.g., a CPS investigation, policy violation(s), changes in family composition, etc.). If the foster parent(s) adoption consideration evaluation was not approved and the foster parent(s) filed a grievance the Adoption Exchange, State Adoption Unit must be informed of the grievance. Adoption AssistanceAdoption Assistance is funding used to facilitate the adoption of children with special needs who might otherwise not be adopted. Adoption assistance is assistance provided on behalf of an eligible child to offset the costs associated with adopting and meeting the on-going needsof the child. Adoption assistance can be provided in the form of payments, medical coverage and reimbursement of non-recurring expenses. Child Placing Agency (CPA)A CPA is an agency that provides foster and adoptive placement services for children in foster and adoptive resource homes for individualized care, supervision and oversight. CPAs are responsible for assessing the placement regarding the appropriateness of the room, board and watchful oversight that the prospective foster and adoptive families will provide. The CPAs employees and their foster and adoptive parents work as a team to provide a stabilizing and nurturing environment that promotes safety, well-being and permanency. Special Needs DeterminationA child identified as a child with special needs must meet specific federal and state factors or conditions. To be eligible for Title IV-E adoption assistance, the child must qualify as a child with special needs and Title IV-E eligibility criteria. Special needs determinations are made by DFCS Social Services Administration Unit (SSAU) in accordance with policy 12.1 Eligibility - Adoption Assistance Payments, Medicaid & Non-Recurring. FORMS AND TOOLSAdoption Consideration Evaluation - Georgia SHINES Job AideIMPACT Family Evaluation Family Approval and Adoptive Registration Cover LetterIMPACT Family Evaluation Family Approval and Adoptive Registration Cover Letter (Instructions)Foster Parent Affidavit for Consideration of Adopting Foster Child(ren) in HomeFoster Parent Affidavit for Consideration of Adopting Foster Child(ren) in Home (Spanish) Foster Parent(s) Notification of Decision Regarding Interest in Adopting Foster Child(ren) Foster Parent(s) Notification of Decision Regarding Interest in Adopting Foster Child(ren) (Spanish)Notification to Foster Parent(s) of Filing of Petition to Terminate Parental Rights Notification to Foster Parent(s) of Filing of Petition to Terminate Parental Rights (Spanish) Post Adoption Services/Adoption Assistance Benefit HandoutPost Adoption Services/Adoption Assistance Benefit Handout (Spanish) Prospective Foster or Adoptive Parent Medical Evaluation ReportVerification of Receipt of Information Packet Regarding Post Adoption Services/Adoption Assistance BenefitsVerification of Receipt of Information Packet Regarding Post Adoption Services/Adoption Assistance Benefits (Spanish)",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-11-adoption-section-116-foster-parent-adoption

The registry allows possible biological but not legal fathers to provide identifying information about themselves, the mother, and the child so these registered men can be notified about adoption proceedings. The putative father registry is not a public file. Search requests can be made only by:A governmental department, board, commission, bureau, agency, or political subdivision of any state for purposes of locating an absent parent; orThe Georgia Department of Public Health, a licensed child-placing agency, or a member in good standing of the State Bar of Georgia, for purposes of locating a biological father. Use of the putative father registry allows DFCS to ascertain if there is a man or men who alleges that he may be the father of a child born to the mother within the time frame of the birth of this child. The putative father certificate and birth certificate become part of the legal documents freeing the child for adoption and must be included with the voluntary surrender of parental rights documents and termination court orders sent to the Superior Court for adoption finalization. The putative father registry is a state level option; not every state maintains a putative father registry. DFCS is not obligated to conduct a putative father search in another state; however, if the Social Services Case Manager has knowledge that the birth mother resided in another state at the time of the child's conception and that state maintains a putative father registry, best practice would mandate that the Social Services Case Manager contact the other state and request that a putative father search be performed.

If there is any information that suggest the child is subject to the Indian Child Welfare Act, adhere to the provisions outlined in policy 1.6 Administration: Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) and Transfer of Responsibility for Placement and Care to the Tribal Agency. NOTE: A child is subject to ICWA if the child is a member of a federally recognized Indian Tribe, or eligible for membership and has a biological parent who is an enrolled member.Complete with the parent(s) the Birth Family Background Information for Child form.Begin the Life Book, if one has not been started:Secure or take photographs of the parent(s), home, pets and other family members if possible.Encourage the parent(s) to provide letters, pictures, audiotapes or any other information to be included in the Life Book.Gather medical history to include place of birth, significant illnesses, names of doctors and clinics utilized for childs record.Use the Life Book process to work with both the child(ren) and parent(s) around the impending separation, if possible.Inform the parent(s) of the provisions of the Adoption Reunion Registry, which allows the parent(s) the option to register his/her willingness to have future contact with the child (see policy 11.17 Adoption: Adoption Reunion Registry for the complete provisions of the adoption reunion registry).Inform the (legal and biological) parent(s) and child (if at least 14 years of age) of the possibility of entering into a post adoption contact agreement with the pre-adoptive or adoptive parent(s). (see policy 11.15 Adoption: Post Adoption Contact Agreement for provisions of a post adoption contact agreement):a. Have the birth parent(s) determine if he/she would like to consider this option; andb. Obtain the birth parent(s) decision on his/her willingness to engage in a post adoption contact agreement.Submit a request to have the putative father registry checked to identify possible biological fathers who are not the legal father of the child. See policy 11.2 Adoption: Putative Father Registry & Birth Certificates.Obtain a certified copy of the official long form birth certificate with the state registration number and raised seal (see policy 11.2 Adoption: Putative Father Registry & Birth Certificates).To prepare a child for the adoption, the SSCM will:Make the child aware that he/she will be moving into an adoptive home.Encourage the child to face and deal with his/her feelings about his/her birth family and the final separation from them.Encourage the child to express his/her feelings of sadness, anger, rejection, anxiety, etc. around the prospective change.Assist the child in understanding about adoption and the difference from foster care.Encourage the child to face and deal with his/her feelings regarding leaving the foster home, if applicable.Include the child in the planning, with a chance to express the type of family with whom he/she would like to live.Start the childs Life Book if it was not initiated when the child entered foster care. It is a useful tool in helping the child understand his/her history and to identify, and begin to deal with, feelings regarding the past.Use the licensed therapist as a resource that may assist in preparing a child for the transition into an adoptive family. PRACTICE GUIDANCEA fundamental part of an adoption program is based in Family Centered Practice. The parent(s) may come to the agency requesting to voluntarily surrender their legal parental rights to the child, or they may be involved in court action to terminate parental rights. No matter which manner they enter the adoption program, it is important that their rights be safeguarded and that the necessary information is secured to provide as smooth a transition as possible for the child to move into a permanent home. It is important to obtain as much information as possible from birth parent(s) and family members to allow the child to have as much knowledge as possible regarding his/her biological heritage. The SSCM should help the parent(s) understand the importance of the child having information regarding his/her biological heritage as he/she passes through thevarious developmental stages. The collection of background information can also assist the parent(s) in the separation process and provide relative resources for placement. Working with the child around the separation and loss of the biological family can begin the process that will allow the child to be ready to move into an adoptive family. Even if the child is to be adopted by the foster family where he/she has been living for some time, the issues around adoptive placement must be addressed as the change in status from foster child to adoptive child in the family will have a great effect on the relationships and the family system. A good relationship with the child enables the SSCM to help the child move into the adoptive family more readily. Adoption Reunion RegistryThe Georgia Adoption Reunion Registry provides services to birth parents, adopted persons, adoptive parents and siblings who are attempting to obtain non-identifying or identifying information from the sealed file. Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA)The Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 was enacted by Congress to address the alarming rate of removals of American Indian children from their homes for foster care and adoptive placements. The Act establishes standards as well as a protocol for providing child welfare services to ensure that agencies meet the cultural needs of Indian children requiring out-of- home placement and to protect the continued existence and integrity of Indian tribes. It gives the Indian childs parents or Indian custodian and their tribe the right to intervene or request transfer to their tribal court of any proceedings involving out-of-home placement of or termination of parental rights to an Indian child. If the child is a member of a tribe or eligible for membership in a tribe, the family, the Indian custodian and the tribe have rights under the ICWA. These rights apply to any child protection case, adoption, guardianship, termination of parental rights action, runaway, or truancy matter involving the placement of an Indian child (foster care placements, termination of parental rights, pre-adoptive placements, adoptive placements, both voluntary and involuntary placements, transfers of placement and placements due to failed adoptions).Foster care placement means any action removing an Indian child from the parent or Indian custodian for temporary placement in a foster home or institution or in the home of a guardian or conservator where the parent or Indian custodian cannot have the child returned upon demand, but where parental rights have not been terminated;Termination of parental rights means any action that may result in the termination of the parent-child relationship;Pre-adoptive placement means the temporary placement of an Indian child in a foster home or institution after the termination of parental rights, but prior to or in lieu of adoptive placement; andAdoptive placement means the permanent placement of an Indian child for adoption, including any action resulting in a final decree of adoption. ICWA defines the term Indian as any person who is a member of a federally recognized American Indian Tribe or Alaska Native Village, or who is an Alaskan Native and a member of the Regional Corporations formed under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971 (ANCSA).Indian ChildAny unmarried person who is under age 18 and is determined by the Tribe, Bureau of Indian Affairs, or Department of the Interior, to be:A member or eligible for membership of an Indian Tribe as determined by the Tribe and/or Nation, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), or the Department of the Interior; orEligible for membership in an Indian Tribe as determined by the Tribe and the biological child of a member of an Indian Tribe. Post Adoption Contact AgreementA post adoption contact agreement is a voluntary written agreement between the pre-adoptive or adoptive parent(s) and birth relative(s) to permit continuing contact between the birth relative(s) and the child. FORMS AND TOOLSAdoption Process - Georgia SHINES Job Aide Birth Family Background Information for Child Creating and Using Life BooksViewing Family Systems",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-11-adoption-section-111-adoption-preparation

(See policy 10.23 Foster Care: Case Planning for additional guidance on managing setbacks.)Initiate referrals for services to address an identified safety need (see policy 19.17 Case Management: Service Provision).Conduct a face-to-face meeting with the family at the conclusion of the aftercare period to discuss case closure (see policy 10.26 Foster Care: Case Closure). PRACTICE GUIDANCEWhat is aftercare?Aftercare refers to the continued efforts and resources needed to further maximize the potential for positive outcomes once children exit foster care. Aftercare services can be used to help sustain permanency and prevent children from re-entering the foster care system after everyone thought they had achieved permanency in a safe and stable living environment.Common factors that increase the likelihood of foster care re-entrySome factors associated with foster care re-entry include:Children with behavioral or health issues: After the supports that were present while the child was in foster care are removed, some parents may become overwhelmed.Length of time a child remains in foster care: The longer a child is separated from the family, the greater the impact on the parent-child relationship as well as other family relationships.Children placed in non-kinship foster care settings: Family connections can become strained when children are not placed with kin.Placement instability: Structure and consistency within a childs environment may play a causal role in the development of self-regulatory abilities (e.g. impulse control, abstract thinking, planning and the anticipation of consequences). Consequently, the stress and uncertainty experienced in the foster care system may contribute to considerable and lasting changes in the brain that do not contribute to its positive development.Parental mental illness: This is a lifelong issue that can disrupt the family if not managed on a continual basis.Parental substance abuse: This is a lifelong issue that can disrupt the family if not managed on a continual basis.Parental poverty: Foster care cannot alleviate poverty so families still have to manage the daily struggles of living in poverty.Parental ambivalence about reunification: Sometimes others want reunification more than the parents or force change upon the parents without building a consensus for change. Change derived in such a manner might not be maintained by the parents.The amount of family coherence at the time of separation: Some families may not be a cohesive unit prior to the child entering foster care. Consequently, the separation associated with foster care may pull them further apart.Previous failed reunification attempts: When one does not learn from the mistakes of ones past, one might often repeat them.Inappropriate service goals and tasks for families: When the goals are not realistic or do not address the underlying issues that lead to child maltreatment, the familys efforts and energy (as well as that of DFCS) may be exerted on the wrong things. Duration of aftercare servicesIf aftercare supervision is needed, it should only be for a short period of time. Neither reunification nor any other permanency plan can be considered achieved without a sound determination that the child will be transitioning from foster care into a safe environment. Therefore, if one believes DFCS involvement is needed beyond six months after the achievement of the permanency plan, then one may need to reconsider whether the permanency plan is appropriate.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-10-foster-care-section-1027-after-care

This may be obtained through reunification or any other approved permanency plan (see policy 10.22 Foster Care: Permanency Planning).Recommend closure of cases involving caregiver substance abuse only after meeting all requirements as outlined in policy 19.26 Case Management: Case Management Involving Caregiver Substance Use or Abuse.Close a foster care case only after receiving authorization from the Juvenile Court. EXCEPTION: Closures resulting from the appropriate termination of a Voluntary Placement Agreement do not necessarily require court authorization (see policy 10.2 Foster Care: Placement of a Child via a Voluntary Placement Agreement).Document all case closure decision making activities in Georgia SHINES within 72 hours of occurrence. The Social Services Case Manager (SSCM) will:Review the Case Plan to determine if sufficient progress has been made to remedy the conditions that caused a child to enter foster care and assess the following:The familys developmental stage(s);The familys interaction around specific everyday situations they were previously unable to safely manage resulting in the emergence of safety threats;Observed and documented changes in behaviors and/or circumstances that alleviate safety concerns and enhance caregiver protective capacities such as the familys development of specific skills, including the ability to:Identify high-risk situations;Identify early warning signals;Prevent high-risk situations;Interrupt high-risk situations not avoided; andEscape situations not interrupted.Obtain feedback from all service providers regarding case closure (i.e. recommendations, issues, concerns).In cases involving substance abuse:Obtain verification from the treatment provider that the parent has successfully completed a substance abuse treatment program, demonstrates behavior that supports a desire to maintain a sober lifestyle and the ability to provide protection and appropriate care for the child, and has a relapse plan that addresses child safety.Observe the parents behavior for indicators that the parent is maintaining a sober lifestyleFollow policy 19.26 Case Management: Case Management Involving Caregiver Substance Use or Abuse related to case closure.Staff the case with the Social Services Supervisor to discuss reasons for case closure.Confirm that the child has achieved an approved permanency plan (i.e., Reunification, Adoption, Guardianship, and Another Planned Permanent Living Arrangement).Verify that all qualifying conditions for return have been met and obtain authorization to request approval from the juvenile court to proceed with case closure.Discuss what, if any, additional services will be provided to the family post-closure.Conduct a Family Team Meeting or some other transitional meeting to discuss case closure, making a good faith effort to involve all family members in the discussion of the case closure decision (see policy 19.3 Case Management: Solution-Focused Family Team Meeting). The discussion should include the following:Progress made in the areas of caregiver protective capacity and remediation of the issues that caused the child to enter foster care;The plan to prevent the circumstances that led to the childs removal from reoccurring (i.e. relapse prevention plan);Formal or informal supports that can remain involved with the family following case closure;Linkage to community resources that might provide future support;Show the family where to locate contact information for various community agencies, including how to apply for public assistance.Verify that the family understands how to utilize community supports by asking them to demonstrate or describe what they will do in various circumstances in which supportive services might be needed (e.g., food, utilities, mental health services).Explain that the child will remain on Medicaid without any coverage gaps once exiting foster care, if they are eligible.Issues or concerns the family may have.Arrange any additional services needed post foster care.Notify all service providers actively involved in the case of the case closure decision and request any outstanding invoices be submitted expeditiously.Ensure the parent/caregiver has received copies of the childs health and education records when the child exits foster care. Provide this information directly to youth who exit care after attaining 18 years of age (see policies 10.11 Foster Care: Medical, Dental, and Developmental Needs and 10.13 Foster Care: Educational Needs).Ensure the child has a drivers license or official identification, if applicable (see policy 13.8 Independent Living Program: Driver Education, Licensure and State Identification).If applicable, coordinate with the parent and the Amerigroup Care Coordination Team (CCT) to schedule the required discharge physical.Notify the Revenue Maximization (RevMax) Unit, Department of Community Health (DCH), and the Amerigroup Care Coordination Teams (CCT) of a childs exit from foster care within 24 hours.Update Georgia SHINES to reflect case closure.Close each Foster Care Child (FCC) StageWhen Post Foster Care (PFC) stages are needed to manage relative or guardianship subsidy payments or Independent Living Program (ILP) services for youth no longer in care, stage progress the FCC stage to the Post Foster Care (PFC) stage before completing FCC stage closures.When families are referred for Family Preservation Services, stage progress the Foster Care Family (FCF) stage to the Ongoing (ONG) stage before completing the FCF stage closure.Add the childs new legal status within 48 hours of the change.Choose the appropriate Not in DFCS Custody legal status based upon the courts decision/ruling.The legal status effective date is the date DFCS no longer has legal custody of the child.End any open placements.The placement end date is the same as the Not in DFCS Custody legal status effective date.The end time entered does not have to be exact, but should be within 30 minutes of the reported change. The end time should not be 12:00 AM.End any open payment of care (POC) records. The POC end date is the same as the placement end date.Submit a Notification of Change (NOC) to notify the RevMax Unit that foster care Medicaid eligibility has ended.Follow up with the RevMax Unit to ensure timely completion.To close the FCC stage, an end date must be indicated on the Eligibility Summary List page.On the Foster Care Application List page, all IV-E Applications and NOC entries must be in approved (APRV) status (not PROC or PEND) before stage closure.Address Case Watch Errors and WarningsEnsure all case activity has been documented and upload all appropriate documents into Georgia SHINES External Documentation (e.g. court orders, etc.)Complete the Stage Closure page.Choose the appropriate closure reason and add relevant comments.The stage closes when the Supervisor approves the FCC stage closure.After all FCC stages for a case have been closed, complete the Stage Closure page in the Foster Child Family (FCF) stage.After the Supervisor approves the FCF stage closure, the FCF stage closes. The Social Services Supervisor will:Review each case prior to closure to confirm that sufficient progress has been made to remedy the safety conditions that caused a child to enter foster care. Look for evidence in the case record that supports the decision to close the case.Staff each case with the SSCM prior to case closure (see policy 19.6 Case Management: Supervisory Staffing). During the staffing:Engage the SSCM in partnership decision-making to help the SSCM evaluate the familys progress toward achieving and maintaining behavioral changes that promote child safety and well-being.Encourage the SSCMs use of critical thinking by seeking answers to questions such asWhy do we believe a familys circumstances have been adjusted to the point where conditions are safe for a child to be returned to the home?How reliable and valid is the information we have obtained that supports the decision to close the case?Have we spoken to everyone with relevant information about this familys capacity to protect the child(ren) exiting foster care?Are there any actions or services still needed to manage any behaviors or conditions that threaten child safety and well-being?Is an in-home safety intervention warranted?Has the juvenile court provided its approval of case closure?What formal and/or informal supports can remain involved with the family following case closure?Confirm that case documentation is current in Georgia SHINES prior to case closure, especially all evidence supporting case closure. This includes documentation of the supervisory staffing that evaluated the case information that had been gathered and weighed the evidence in a decision-making process that clearly supported the decision to close the case. PRACTICE GUIDANCEConclusion of ServicesPermanency planning begins when a child enters foster care. Case closure is appropriate once the permanency plan goals are achieved. Throughout the life of the case, the various judicial reviews should have been leading to a case outcome that ensures the safety, permanency and well-being of the child. Consequently, conclusion of services should be a natural and planned component of the case work process. Maximum effort must be put forth to fully engage the family throughout the life of the case and clearly communicate the desired case plan outcomes. Consider the following when ending services with families:Family PreparationThroughout the life span of the case families should be knowledgeable regarding what requirements are needed for case closure and should be engaged regularly regarding their level of progress made toward that end.Developing Support SystemsFamilies should be assisted in developing formal and informal systems that can support them during and after DFCS involvement. The support system should be identified with the involvement of the family. This support system or family team can assist a family after case closure. Families should be encouraged to utilize these systems during the life of the case as a way for them to practice for life after DFCS intervention ends.DisengagementWhen terminating DFCS involvement with families, it is important to begin the process of disengagement of the working relationship between the SSCM and family prior to closing the case. The family should be reminded of the ongoing progress being made in resolution of risk and safety factors and that this will lead to a reduced need for DFCSinvolvement. This can be a challenging process for both the SSCM and the family as the SSCM must separate from the family while continuing to support and encourage them. The goal of the SSCM is to increase the emphasis on the family taking on more responsibility for problem solving and follow up.Family ReactionsConclusion of services can be met with ambivalent feelings, especially when the helping relationship with the family has been rewarding. Some typical reactions may include denial, regression, creation of additional needs, and flight. It is essential to validate the familys feelings regarding case closure and provide positive feedback regarding their achievements as well as assisting them in recognizing their strengths and abilities.SSCM ReactionsSSCMs may experience a sense of loss as a result of discontinuing their work with a child and/or family. Separating from someone with whom a meaningful relationship has been developed can be difficult. SSCMs should talk to their supervisors for support and assistance with processing their feelings.Process EvaluationConclusion of services should be a joint decision-making process between the SSCM and the family. The SSCM should review with the family all critical elements of intervention, while empowering the family to express their opinions/feelings and provide constructive feedback.

process of reconnecting children in out-of-home care with their families, is the preferred permanency arrangement. The trial home visit was introduced in federal law to improve stability in the reunification process and is a key strategy in assuring successful reunification. A trial home visit should only be recommended when it is expected to be successful and requires careful planning and preparation prior to and following the transition. Each family will have a different reaction to child returning home on a trial home visit; therefore, the preparation and planning should be individualized based on the needs of each family. When planning a trial home visit, consideration must be given to the following:Safety threats resulting in the childs removal have been successfully mitigated.The age of the child.Number of siblings that will be returning with the child.The length of time the child was in foster care.The quality and consistency of visitation between the parent, guardian or legal custodian and child.The childs special needs, characteristics, vulnerability to harm and capacity to self- protect.Any new household members (i.e. boyfriend, girlfriend, other family) since the child entered care.The quality of the relationship between the parent, guardian or legal custodian and child.The quality of extended family support.The parents, guardians or legal custodians protective capacities and progress on their case plan outcomes.Support services that may be needed. Preparing the ChildThe amount and type of preparation needed for the trial home visit, will vary for each child. The child's vulnerability impacts they type of preparation needed for the child home visit. Child vulnerabilities include the childs age, the length of time in out-of-home care, and the quality of the childs relationships with his/her parent, guardian, or legal custodian. The childs feelings also play a key role in his/her adjustment to returning home. Many children worry that they will subjected again to abuse and/or neglect. Some may experience feelings of disloyalty to their placement resource family for wanting to return home; and some may feel disloyal to their parents for missing the placement resource family. The child should be encouraged to share his/her feelings about the return home with a trusted adult, such as the placement resource, SSCM, behavior aide, therapist, etc. The child feelings should be acknowledged and addressed, including any fears. Additionally, the SSCM should discuss with the child the expectations, responsibilities, and safeguards that will be in place to protect the child. The SSCM should discuss safety with the child and what the child should do if the child feels unsafe.Preparing the Parent, Guardian, or Legal CustodianThe parent, guardian, or legal custodian may feel uncertain about his or her ability to adequately meet the child's needs or more feel overly confident. The SSCM should help the parent, guardian or legal custodian prepare for the trial home visit by:Identifying the positive behavioral change that enhanced protective capacities and alleviated safety concerns. Celebrate successes.Providing the parent, guardian or legal custodian the opportunity to implement parenting practices learned.Informing of the agencys continued involvement with family to support a successful reunification.Identifying any anticipated issues and discuss the familys prevention plan to address any identified concerns. Preparing the Placement ResourceThe bonds that often develop between some placement resource and children placed in their home are important and can evoke feelings of loss for both parties. In addition, the placement resources feelings can influence the child's view of returning to their family, therefore it is important to include them in the planning for the trial home visit. This include their involvement in transitional visits with the parent, guardian, legal custodian, participation in the family meetings, and maintaining an ongoing relationship to support the childs transition to their home.Supporting the Family During the Trial Home VisitOnce a family reorganizes and settles into a new normal when their child is out of the home in foster care, reintegrating the child back into the home may be challenging. Often parents revert to more familiar manners of functioning that resulted in the childs removal. A trial home visit allows for the parent, guardian or legal custodian demonstrate effective parenting. During this period, it is essential that services provided to the family are consistent, targeted, and behaviorally driven. Children and families should receive services in the least restrictive environment which is most often their home. This allows the SSCM to have a better picture of family functioning and adaptability to the daily stresses of parenthood and life. Supporting the family through the trial home visit by being a resource and monitoring their progress are additional benefits for the reunification process. More frequent purposeful contacts may be required initially during the initial phase of trial home visit to continue to assess the childs safety and wellbeing as well as parenting abilities and behaviors. As the parent becomes more confident in their parenting skills, identifying stressors, and utilizing their action plans, the frequency and nature of contacts will need to be reassessed to reflect the progress that the family has made. During the trial home visit period, it is important to recognize that families will have challenges, setbacks, and successes. Encourage the family to utilize the skills and relationships that they have developed through action planning to address any challenges or setbacks. Being able to identify the challenges and setbacks but also celebrate and recognize their successes assist in ensuring a positive trial home visit and reunification. It also important and recognize and celebrate successes.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-10-foster-care-section-1024-trial-home-visit

In order of preference, the permanency plan options are:Reunification: The return of a child in the temporary custody of DFCS to the legal and physical custody of the parent, guardian or legal custodian. Custody to a non- custodial parent is also deemed reunification.Adoption: Adoption establishes a new legal family giving adoptive parents and children the same rights and benefits of those who are born into a family.Permanent Guardianship (legal guardianship): A judicially created relationship between the child and kinship caregiver which is intended to be permanent and self- sustaining as evidenced by the transfer to the kinship caregiver of the following parental rights with respect to the child:ProtectionEducationCare and control of the personGuardianship of the personDecision making NOTE: Georgia has opted out of the Title IV-E Kinship Guardianship Assistance Program.Another Planned Permanent Living Arrangement (APPLA): DFCS maintains care and custody of the youth who has attained 16 years of age and arranges a living situation in which the youth is expected to remain until adulthood.

Such a finding does not excuse DFCS from continuing to search for relatives, which must continue throughout the life of the case. Even if a relative is not a proper placement option, finding those relatives may give the child the opportunity to form deeper family connections and sources of support later in life.Thoroughly explore any information which suggests that a child is of Native American heritage in compliance with the Indian Child Welfare Act (see policy 1.6 Administration: Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) and Transfer of Responsibility for Placement and Care to a Tribal Agency).Review and analyze the case history, Family Functioning Assessment, Comprehensive Child and Family Assessment (CCFA), other assessments completed on the child and family and any other background information in preparation for the meeting with the parents, guardian or legal custodian to develop the case plan (see policy 19.10 Case Management: Analyzing DFCS History).Utilize the Concurrent Planning Assessment Guide within the first 30 days of a child entering foster care to determine the suitability of concurrent planning.

In order to grow up to be healthy, self-sufficient adults, children need to experience stability and continuity in a lifetime relationship with a parent or other permanent caregiver. Permanency planning is the process of assessing and preparing a child for long term care when in out-of-home placements. Permanency planning must focus on what is in the childs best interests, and therefore requires an initial and ongoing assessment of the needs of the child and family. A thorough understanding of the family is the foundation of all child welfare interventions. The assessment process is ongoing and involves gathering facts, observations and information about and from the family. The assessment should also involve:Identification of the challenges the family faces with everyday life tasks.Exploration of how these challenges create safety threats for the child.Exploration of exceptions to the challenge or situations when the completion of the everyday life task went well.Exploration of kinship connections including those that can provide placement, permanency and other types of support to the family. Such information is then analyzed, and conclusions are drawn about family functioning, including family strengths and needs. The SSCM gains a better understanding of the family as a unique system. There is insight into how family members think, feel, behave, relate to others and respond to various situations, including the removal of the child. Assessment results guide staff in making sound decisions about the best placement for the child, critical service needs of the child and family and the most viable plan for achieving permanency. Initially, the assessment assists staff in making a prognosis regarding the likelihood for reunification, the preferred permanency plan when safety can be assured. For some children in care (particularly young children and children whose families are less likely to respond to time-limited reunification services), a concurrent permanency plan may be developed. Concurrent planning allows for an alternative plan to be in place should reunification not be possible or safe. The plan may have to be continuously refined in partnership with the family to ensure achievement of permanency in the best interest of the child.A fundamental principle of permanency planning is the understanding that when children are unable to live with their family, efforts to promote the connectedness of family and significant relationships with people who are important to them are essential to the childs culture, identity, and sense of belonging. Therefore, it is essential that diligent search efforts to locate kin and other committed individuals begin as early as possible to facilitate permanency for the child through adoption or guardianship, when reunification with one or both parents has been ruled out (see policy 19.20 Case Management: Diligent Search and 10.4 Foster Care: Selecting a Placement Resource). Foster care is a temporary setting and not a place for children to spend any more time than is necessary. It is critical to begin planning for permanency from the time children enter care and to keep the family actively involved in permanency decisions for the children. Regardless of the permanency plan, the safety and well-being of the children must be reasonably assured. Permanent PlacementGeorgia law defines a permanent placement as:Return of the legal custody of a child to his/her parent.;Placement of a child with an adoptive parent pursuant to a final order of adoption; orPlacement of a child with a permanent guardian. The Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA)The Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) includes a number of provisions that are intended to move children more quickly through the foster care system into safe, permanent families including:A timeframe of 12 months to have a permanency plan in place for every child in foster care.A permanency hearing and a judicial determination regarding reasonable efforts to finalize the permanency plan within 12 months of the childs removal (and every 12 months thereafter as long as the child remains in care). NOTE: Georgia law requires the initial permanency plan hearing to be held within 9 months for children under seven years of age and within 12 months for children seven years of age or older.Documentation of a compelling reason whenever DFCS recommends in its case plan a permanency plan other than reunification, adoption or guardianship or permanent placement with a fit and willing relative. NOTE: Effective January 1, 2014, live with a fit and willing relative is no longer a permanent placement option in Georgia.The mandatory filing of a petition to terminate parental rights whenever the court has determined the child to be abandoned or the parent has been convicted of certain felony offenses or the child has been in care 15 out of the most recent 22 months unless a compelling reason is documented.Concurrent planning with respect to two practices: The selection of dual permanency plans. AndThe concurrent efforts to identify, recruit and approve a qualified family for a child at the same time that the County Department is providing reunification services.ReunificationReunification is the return of a child in the temporary custody of DFCS to the legal and physical custody of the parent, guardian or legal custodian from whom custody was removed. Custody to a non-custodial parent is also deemed reunification. Reunification is an appropriate permanency plan when the family requires time-limited reunification services (generally provided no longer than 12 to 15 months) to make it possible for the child to safely return home. When selecting reunification as a permanency plan, consideration should also be given to the following:The parents, guardians, or legal custodians and the childs desire to be reunified.The parent-child relationship and bond including any observable attachment.The consensus built on the outcomes needed by the family and the readiness, willingness and ability of the family to participate in and benefit from time-limited reunification services.The length of time needed to remedy the challenging life tasks that resulted in the childs removal.Individual challenges the parents, guardians or legal custodians may have that cannot be addressed in the near future (e.g., lengthy period of incarceration; significant mental health or cognitive delays; chronic, un-rehabilitated substance use; etc.).The formal/informal supports available to the family via extended family and/or community. AdoptionAdoption is an appropriate permanency plan when the parents, guardians or legal custodians are unable to safely care for the child or reunification is not in the childs best interest. Kin may be selected as the adoptive resource. Children may be reluctant to consent to adoption due to not wanting to sever ties with their family. The Regional Adoption Coordinator (RAC) can assist in discussing adoption with the child and/or family or refer the child to a counselor specializing in adoption preparation. When selecting adoption as a permanency plan, consideration should also be given to the following:The determination of whether or not the child can be safely returned home.The legal grounds for TPR including whether or not the child is or can become legally free.The execution of voluntary surrenders.The childs expressed wishes regarding adoption, and their ability to accept and respond to family life (if age 14 or older, the child must provide written consent to the adoption).The childs sense of family, and their need and ability to maintain contact with the family.The current caregivers willingness to adopt, ability to meet the childs needs and the childs attachment to the current caregiver. GuardianshipDFCS is charged with ensuring the safety, permanency and well-being of children. When a family becomes involved with DFCS, it is essential to fully assess and mutually determine the best interest of the children as it pertains to their safety, permanency and well-being, during and after DFCS involvement. Prior to pursuing permanent guardianship as a permanency plan for a child in foster care, DFCS must demonstrate reasonable efforts towards reunification unless circumstances exist where reasonable efforts for reunification are not required. Once reunification is no longer determined to be in the best interest of the child, adoption must be thoroughly explored and ruled out as a preferred permanency plan before selecting permanent guardianship as the plan. Permanent guardianship for a child in foster care may be granted by the juvenile court when it has been determined to be in the best interest of the child. The guardianship order establishes a permanent guardian and outlines the permanent guardians rights and responsibilities concerning the care, custody and control of a child. Guardianship applies to the person(s) specified on the court order. The court may enter an order of support on behalf of the child against the parents. Permanent guardianships granted by the juvenile court may only be dissolved or modified if there is a material (important and substantial) change in the childs or guardians circumstances. A change in the biological parents circumstances may be construed by the court as a material change in the childs circumstances. Therefore, everyone must be informed that although the guardianship is intended to be permanent, it may not be. Permanent guardianship is possible when a child is adjudicated dependent and the following exist:Reasonable efforts to reunify the child with his/her parents would be detrimental to the child or the living parents have consented to the permanent guardianship.Adoption has been thoroughly explored and not in the best interest of the child.Non-reunification has been granted by the court.The proposed guardian can provide a safe and permanent home for the child.A permanent guardian is in the best interests of the child and the individual chosen to be the permanent guardian is the most appropriate person taking into account the childs best interest. Non-ReunificationDFCS should only request a non-reunification determination when seeking permanent guardianship, as DFCS requires the non-reunification order as an eligibility criteria for the guardianship subsidy. In all other circumstances non-reunification should not be requested. It is important that DFCS continue to demonstrate reasonable efforts to reunify the family at all times during the dependency action, especially in circumstances where termination of parental rights is being pursued. Another Planned Permanent Living Arrangement (APPLA)Another planned permanent living arrangement (APPLA) is an appropriate plan when:The child is at least 16 years of age.Adoption and guardianship have been ruled out as not being appropriate or in the best interest of the child. AndA compelling reason is documented in the case plan and court order for choosing APPLA. The two options that classify as APPLA include Long-Term Foster Care (LTFC) by Agreement and Emancipation. Long-term foster care is feasible when no other plan is appropriate, and the present caregiver is available and willing to provide a home for the child as long as foster care is needed. It should not be selected for a young child. With long-term foster care, in most instances, a child, the caregiver and the County Department sign an informal, non-legal agreement indicating the intention for the placement to last until the child no longer needs foster care placement. If possible, the childs parents, guardians or legal custodians also sign. Limitations of long-term foster care include:The lack of permanency.The lack of a legal bo",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-10-foster-care-section-1022-permanency-planning

Emancipation and Transition:

Emancipation may be considered when no other permanency plan is appropriate. This includes cases where there is no suitable adoptive or foster family, and the child must remain in foster care until age 18. Planning for youth with special needs or severe limitations must begin well before they reach age 18 due to limited resources and long waiting lists for placements.
Selecting Initial Permanency Options:

While reunification is the first permanency plan to consider when it is in the child's best interest, situations may allow DFCS to pursue adoption or permanent guardianship from the outset. This should be done in cases where it aligns with policy 17.11 (Legal: Termination of Parental Rights [TPR]) and policy 9.5 (Eligibility: Reasonable Efforts). Staff should consult with the Regional FPS, RAC, and SAAG to decide on the best permanency option for the child.
Concurrent Planning:

Concurrent planning should be employed to expedite the transition from out-of-home care to permanency. This involves working towards reunification while simultaneously preparing for an alternative plan such as adoption or guardianship. Early assessment of non-custodial parents, kin, and other committed individuals is crucial for exploring all potential permanency options.
Early Assessment for Concurrent Planning:

Information gathered before and shortly after a child enters out-of-home care is crucial for early determination of the likelihood of reunification and identification of alternate permanency options. All cases should be evaluated for concurrent planning services using the Concurrent Planning Assessment Guide, though not all cases will be appropriate.
Finalizing the Permanency Plan:

In accordance with the Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA), a permanency plan should be finalized within 12 months of a child entering care. Court approval is required to cease reunification efforts and to focus on an alternative permanency plan. Reunification services must continue until another permanency plan is approved by the court.
Documentation and Tools:

Utilize the Concurrent Planning Assessment Guide to assess suitability for concurrent planning services.
Create and utilize Life Books as part of managing the permanency case.
Regularly update and review the Permanency Timeline to track critical actions and progress towards case closure.
Note: It's essential to manage permanency planning with an understanding of the child's current and future needs, focusing on stability and the child's emotional well-being. Changes in placement should be carefully considered, especially if the child has been in a stable environment for an extended period.

If the parenting youths child is placed in DFCS custody, a foster care case plan should be developed with the parenting youth (see policy 10.23 Foster Care: Case Planning). Custody of the Parenting Youths ChildWhen a youth in foster care has a child, the child should remain in the custody of the youth unless it is determined that the parenting youth has abused or neglected the child and the child is unsafe in the custody of the parenting youth.   Parenting youth may need time to adjust to their new role and responsibilities as a parent. Therefore, it is critical the parenting youth and child are in a safe, caring environment that allows the youth the opportunity to enhance their parenting skills. Identifying expectations and outlining responsibilities of the placement resource and the parenting youth regarding the care of the child are critical in facilitating a successful placement. The SSCM and placement resource must give the parenting youth the liberty to parent while providing the support to make their parenting efforts successful. Ongoing safety must be thoroughly assessed through purposeful and collateral contacts. Youth in foster care face numerous challenges in preparing to transition to a successful adulthood. They often lack strong family connections or a supportive role model to assist them in transitioning to adulthood. For youth in foster care who are expecting or parenting, the process of transitioning to adulthood is accelerated even if the youth is ill-prepared to assume adult responsibilities. Therefore, expectant or parenting youth in foster care need a strong support system and targeted services to assist them in enhancing their parental protective capacities while they strive to become successful, self-sufficient adults. If the child of a parenting youth in foster care is ever removed and placed apart from the parent, judicial placement authority must be obtained. The child should be entered intoGeorgia SHINES as a child in foster care, once DFCS has received legal custody through juvenile court.   If the issues requiring the removal from the parenting youth are addressed and the court sanctions reunification, the child should be placed in the same placement as the parenting youth if safe and appropriate. Engaging the Youth Regarding Disclosing the PregnancyYouth in foster care are at higher risk of teen pregnancy than their counterparts not in foster care. The trauma from the abuse or neglect which resulted in the youths placement into foster care may lead to physical and emotional health problems as well as increased vulnerability to teen pregnancy. Lack of a stable parent-figure to educate a youth about pregnancy prevention also contributes to the higher risk of teen pregnancy for youth in foster care. Most youth do not plan to become pregnant or impregnate someone else when they engage in sexual activity. Thus, learning they are expecting a child can be overwhelming. They may struggle with anxiety, depression, feelings of helplessness, fear, worries about the future and/or low self-esteem. It is important that the SSCM recognize these struggles and ensure appropriate services are initiated to assist this youth. The SSCM may need to recognize and set aside their own personal biases about teenage pregnancy and/or the options available to the expectant parent related to the pregnancy to fully support the expectant youth. Youth may find it difficult to disclose the pregnancy to their parents, other family members, and/or their placement resource. The disclosure must come from the youth; however, the youth may need assistance and support from the SSCM regarding how to disclose and handle others responses once they learn of the pregnancy. The SSCM should explain to the youth the importance of support from their parents, other family members and the placement resource throughout the pregnancy and parenthood. Reiterate to the youth that their parents, family and placement resource care about them, and although they may be disappointed, they want what is best for the youth. Some tips for youth to consider when disclosing they are expecting include:Take a deep breath, process the news and develop a plan.Determine when and where to disclose.Prepare what to say.Practice what to say with the SSCM or a friend.Anticipate the reactions of others and their possible questions.Disclose in a relaxing, comfortable manner/environment.Listen to their responses and reassure them that you can handle this with their support.Answer their questions as best you can.Discuss next steps. Supporting the Expectant and Parenting YouthExpectant and parenting youth in foster care need help to guide them along positive developmental pathways and provide their children with the care they need to learn, grow, develop, and reach their full potential. SSCMs can facilitate this by:Supporting the healthy development of the youth parent:Ensure the parent receives consistent medical attention, including prenatal and postnatal care.Provide supports that promote age appropriate developmental goals and address relevant mental health issues, including the impact of trauma.Provide education related to substance abuse (specifically the risks that substance use poses to the developing child), sexual health, the prevention of subsequent pregnancies, and sexually transmitted infections.Encourage healthy relationships with partners, peers, family members, and other supportive people.Promote self-sufficiency and independent living outcomes for expectant and parenting teens by helping them obtain high school diplomas/GEDs and pursue additional education and employment opportunities, or job training.Supporting the healthy development of the child:Ensure the parent receives consistent medical attention, including prenatal care, to increase the likelihood of a healthy birth.Assist the parent in registering for other supports such as Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program so the child receives regular medical care, including developmental screenings.Connect the children of youth mothers and fathers with developmentally appropriate resources, childcare, and services for the child, including transportation and educational opportunities.Supporting strong parent-child relationships that promote attachment and bonding:Provide access to programs that promote positive parenting and emphasize nurturing as well as age-appropriate discipline.Connect the youth to models of good parenting practices and programs that provide education about essential parenting skills and the importance of responsive parenting.Offer opportunities to practice parenting skills in a supportive environment. Funding for a Parenting Youths ChildThe Title IV-E program allows for states to claim reimbursement for the cost of a child living in the same placement as its parent in foster care without obtaining custody of the child (see policy 9.1 Eligibility: Foster Care Maintenance Payments). The added cost of care for the child is reimbursed through the parenting youths IV-E status. Only one payment is made to the placement provider. State funds may be used if the child remains in the custody of a parenting youth in foster care who is not IV-E eligible (see policy 9.10. Eligibility: Special Situations (Trial Home Visits, Runaway, Parenting Youth in Foster Care and Out-of-State IV- E Foster Care)). Georgia Personal Responsibility Education Program (GA-PREP)State PREP awards grants to public and private agencies for educating youth through evidence-based programs to reduce teenage pregnancy, STDs including HIV/AIDS, and STIs among high risk youth. PREP targets youth ages 10-19 who are in foster care, live in geographic areas with high teen birth rates, or come from racial or ethnic minority groups. PREP is funded by both the Administration of Children and Families (ACF) and Family and Youth Services Bureau (FYSB). Georgias Personal Responsibility Education Program (GA-PREP) is administered by the Division of Family and Children Services (DFCS), a division of the Department of Human Services (DHS). Through a competitive funding solicitation, GA-PREP awards grants to public and private agencies for educating youth ages 10-19 and up to 21 if expecting or parenting. GA-PREP serves the larger goals of GAs DHS by providing high risk youth free access to evidence-based teen pregnancy prevention programs and supplemental adult preparation subjects. The Georgia Home Visiting ProgramThe Georgia Home Visiting Program is a statewide effort, sponsored by the Georgia Department of Public Health and supported by your community to ensure that every child in our state gets a great start in life. The program is designed to create a community culture of care, encouragement, and support for all families before and after the birth of a child. Across hundreds of Georgia communities, services are available to ensure that these important early years are rich with opportunities for children to be educated, safe, and healthy. A free Information & Referral Center offers connections to relevant local resources and information. Home Visiting Evidenced Based Models in GeorgiaEarly Head Start-Home Visiting The Early Head StartHome Visiting (EHS-HV) model provides high-quality, culturally competent child development and parent support services with an emphasis on the role of the parent as the child's first and most important relationship. EHS-HV targets low-income pregnant women and families with children birth to three. To be eligible, most families must be at or below the federal poverty level. The EHS-HV model must make at least 10 percent of their enrollment opportunities available to children with disabilities. The scope of services in the home-based model is comprehensive and includes the following:Developmental screening, ongoing observation and assessment, and curriculum planning.Medical, dental, and mental health.Child development and education.Family partnerships and goal setting.Community collaborations to meet additional family needs.Healthy Families GeorgiaAll Healthy Families programs in Georgia are nationally accredited, evidence-based home visiting programs. Services are designed to strengthen families beginning prenatally up to the age of 5 years of a childs life when vital early brain development occurs. Well trained, experienced Family Support Workers provide valuable education, community resources, and tangible support all children and families need to thrive. The mission of Healthy Families Georgia is to promote child well-being and prevent the abuse and neglect of our children through the provision of quality, long- term, intensive home visitation services. The program is designed to strengthen nurturing parent-child relationships, promote healthy childhood growth and development and enhance family functioning.Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP)Nurse Family Partnership aims to empower first-time mothers living in poverty to successfully change their lives and the lives of their children through evidence-based nurse home visiting.Parents as TeachersThe vision of Parents as Teachers (PAT) is that all children will learn, grow and develop to realize their full potential. Within this evidence-based home visiting model, certified parent educators provide information, support and encouragement parents need to help their children develop optimally during the crucial early years of life. PAT sites provide at least two years of services to families with children between prenatal development and kindergarten. Generally, families should be enrolled by the childs 3rd birthday. Sites are affiliated with PAT National Center (PATNC) to ensure model fidelity. The model uses the following four core components to service children and families:Home Visits. Each home visit includes parent-child interaction, family well-being and development centered parenting.Referrals to Community Resources.Health and Child Development Screenings.Group Connections.SafeCareSafeCare is an evidence-based parenting program that addresses both physical abuse and neglect in parents of very young children (ages 0-5). Neglect represents the largest portion of DFCS referrals in Georgia (73.8%) and nationally (78.3%). Children ages 0-5 are among the most vulnerable and are most likely to be victims of substantiated maltreatment. SafeCare is the first of a series of evidence-based programs DHS hopes to implement to best serve the families of Georgia. The Lamaze Method of ChildbirthThe Lamaze method, developed by the French obstetrician Ferdinand Lamaze, has been used in the United States since the late '50s and remains one of the most commonly taught types of childbirth classes. The original focus was on using controlled breathing techniques to cope with labor. According to Lamaze International, the goal of Lamaze classes is to ""increase women's confidence in their ability to give birth."" Toward that end, women learn a variety of simple coping strategies, of which breathing is only one. The classes aim to help women ""learn how to respond to pain in ways that both facilitate labor and increase comfort."" The Lamaze philosophy of birth stipulates that ""birth is normal, natural, and healthy"" and that ""women have a right to give birth free from routine medical interventions."" But Lamaze also educates women so that when interventions are needed, or pain relief medication is desired, women can give true informed consent. Planned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc. or Planned Parenthood, is a nonprofit organization that delivers vital reproductive health care, sex education and information to millions of people worldwide. Teen Parent ConnectionTeen Parent Connection (TPC) is a system of care that provides the support, guidance, and assistance needed by teen mothers and fathers to succeed as adults and parents.

If so, DFCS must determine if this resource is able to accommodate the siblings of children currently in their home/facility.Inform potential placement resources that placement is being sought for a sibling group and the plan is to keep them together throughout the foster care episode.Place all siblings together at the first placement unless there is evidence that placement together is contrary to a childs safety and/or well-being.Prioritize kinship placements (see policy 10.1 Foster Care: Placement of a Child).Place siblings in close proximity to each other, if unable to place them in the same home, in order to increase opportunities for them to have contact (e.g., attempt to place them where they may attend the same school, church, etc.).Make diligent efforts to place siblings back together when they are separated due to emergency removal. Efforts include, but are not limited to: Monthly contact with Resource Development (RD) staff or the Room Board and Watchful Oversight (RBWO) provider regarding ongoing efforts to locate or recruit a placement resource for the entire sibling group;Ongoing follow up with members of a familys kinship network who may be potential placement resources for the siblings or know of other potential kinship resources; andTargeted recruitment for sibling groups, including reaching out to neighbors, teachers, counselors, other school staff, and others who know one or all of the children.Include the explanation for separating a sibling group in the case plan submitted to the court for approval.

Discussions are to occur as part of ongoing supervision, including during case staffing, individual conferences, unit meetings, etc.Document discussions regarding preserving sibling connections in Case Staffing Notes. Documentation must be entered on the Contact Detail page in Georgia SHINES. PRACTICE GUIDANCEPreserving Sibling Connections through Sibling PlacementSibling means a person with whom a child shares one or both parents in common by blood, adoption or marriage, even if the marriage was terminated by death or dissolution. Such individuals are still legally considered a sibling following termination of parental rights (TPR) up until a finalized adoption occurs. The bond between brothers and sisters is unique. It is the longest lasting relationship most people have, including the parent-child or husband-wife relationship. Separating siblings in foster care or for permanency adds to their emotional trauma. For some children, separation from their siblings can be even more traumatic than separation from their parents. Placing siblings together lessens separation trauma, eases the stress on their parents, reinforces the importance of family relationships, and facilitates visits and communication between children and their parents. Therefore, when children enter the care and custody of DFCS, preserving sibling connections must be a crucial component of the case planning process. Reasonable efforts must be made to place siblings together whether in foster, kinship, guardianship or adoptive homes. There may be situations in which children do not meet the legal definition of siblings but have established such a bond that they consider themselves to be siblings. They may have grown up in the same household or shared caregivers for an extended period of time. Moreover, they may have been led to believe by others that they share one or both parents. In such instances, the agency should be sensitive to that relationship and make every effort to preserve that connection in the same manner as it does for legal siblings (to the extent allowed by law). That includes trying to maintain such children in the same placement or arranging frequent visitation. Preserving Sibling Connections through Visitation (formal and informal)When siblings cannot be placed together, ongoing diligent efforts must be made to ensure siblings have the opportunity to interact with each other to maintain their relationship. Enlisting the support of parents and placement providers in the sibling visitation and other interaction plan is important to maintaining the sibling bond. Think about naturally occurring opportunities for the siblings to interact, not just created or formal opportunities (i.e., DFCS supervised visit at the office, visitation centers, etc.). Formal visits provide opportunities for DFCS, RBWO or other agency staff to observe and assess sibling interaction. However, other informal opportunities for siblings to interact provide siblings the ability to bond naturally. Such informal opportunities include birthday parties, graduations, sporting events, family outings, sleepovers, attending church, school, or other community events, etc. Whether formal or informal, the plan for sibling visits must be documented in the visitation plan, which is a part of the case plan. Permanency PlanningPermanency planning should always be done for the sibling group as a unit. Unless an exception has been made and documented, children who become free for adoption should be presented as a group during adoption recruitment activities (e.g., Wednesdays Child, Northwest Adoption Exchange or AdoptUSKids). Use a group photograph when utilizing photo listings (e.g., My Turn Now), and make it clear that an adoptive family is being sought for the entire sibling group. If children are adopted separately, consider writing sibling visitation and ongoing communication into the Adoption Placement Agreement. Moreover, siblings placed for adoption should be educated about the Adoption Registry. PhotographsDuring visitation, DFCS staff and service providers should take the opportunity to photograph a childs interaction with his/her parents, siblings, extended family, friends, etc. Children should be encouraged to add the photographs to their Life Book, which will offer a record of their experiences in foster care. Photographs may also help promote sibling connectivity, especially for siblings not residing in the same out-of-home placement. SkypeSkype is a service that allows users to communicate with other people over the internet by voice (using a microphone), by video (using a webcam) and by instant messaging. There is no charge for calls between users within the Skype service. However, there is a charge for calls to landline telephones and mobile devices. Charges are processed via a debit-based user account system. FORMS AND TOOLSDecision Guide for Sibling Separation for Foster Care Placement",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-10-foster-care-section-1020-preserving-sibling

Reassure the child that the initial visit is in the process of being scheduled.Placement resource: Discuss who will transport the child to the visit, the level of supervision required, who will provide supervision and what role (if any) the placement resource is expected to play during the visitation (e.g. provide supervision, provide support to the birth family, etc.).After the initial visit, develop a formal, written visitation plan that will be followed for the duration of the case, or until a change is needed.Consider the following when scheduling parent  child visitation: Age of the child: Younger children require more frequent visits to develop or maintain bonding with parents/caregivers;Permanency plan for the child: Concurrent planning services may require more frequent visitation to facilitate reunification;Least restrictive setting that does not compromise child safety (e.g., parks, playgrounds, etc.);Childs eating, sleeping, activity patterns, and after school activities;Parents work schedule or other responsibilities;Activities and responsibilities of the placement resource;Providing parenting opportunities: Ways to involve parents in routine/regular activities of parenting such as feeding, changing diapers and other direct care responsibilities, attending childs school functions, medical appointments, sports activities, etc.Observe the childs visits with the birth family to assess parenting skills, attachment, and interaction of the parent and child. Providers and foster parents may help supervise visits but are no substitute for SSCM observations. When providers are utilized for supervision of visits, written documentation is required.Discuss with parents, child, and placement providers any observations, issues or concerns surrounding the visits.Increase the frequency and duration of family visits as the case progresses closer to reunification in accordance with court guidelines for visitation.In accordance with court guidelines for visitation, allow visitation in the home of the parent as a step in transitioning the child from the placement resource back into the parents home. The childs safety during home visits must be reasonably assured. When a visiting resource has been identified, the SSCM will:Ascertain whether the child has a significant, positive relationship with the visiting resource being considered.Arrange a face-to-face contact with the proposed visiting resource to initiate a thorough assessment prior to any visit occurring. If the resource is planning to care for the child in his/her own home, this contact must be made in the persons home.Discuss the following areas and prepare a written summary called a Visiting Resource Evaluation on the Contact Detail page in Georgia SHINES: Identifying information (i.e., name, sex, date of birth, address, telephone number, etc.)Caregiver Safety Screenings in accordance with policy 19.9 Case Management: Safety Screenings: Child Protective Services (CPS) HistorySexual Offender RegistryDepartment of CorrectionsBoard of Pardons and ParoleCriminal Records Check (CRC) in accordance with policy 19.8 Case Management: Criminal Records Checks for all adult household members if visits will occur in the home of the visiting resourceHealth StatusPhysical Home Environment: Must be clean and hazard-free with sufficient space;Gas heaters must be vented;Must have functioning smoke alarms on each level;Must have a functioning carbon monoxide detector if a gas heater, gas water heater, or gas oven is present; andMust have a functioning fire extinguisher.Understanding of Child DevelopmentUnderstanding of the DFCS Discipline Policy: Review and obtain signature of the visiting resource; andProvide a copy to the visiting resource.Number, sex, and ages of children in the home with the child in care (Determine if the visiting resource can care for another child)Other adults who will be present during visitsGeneral plan for contacts with the visiting resource (i.e. frequency, duration, activities, etc.)Approval or Non-Approval (signature and date of SSCM, and County Director/Designee)Make home visits to monitor the appropriateness of the visiting resource no less frequently then once every six months.Document how utilization of the visiting resource is in the best interest of the child on the Contact Detail page in Georgia SHINES. If parents object to any individual having visits with their child while in DFCS custody, the SSCM will:Evaluate the reasons for the parental objection.Assess the significance of the childs relationship to the individual and the impact on the child if visits are not allowed.Determine if visitation with the individual in question is contrary to the safety or well- being of the child.Obtain supervisory approval and provide written justification to the court for any decision to override a parental objection.In accordance with court guidelines for visitation, ensure the visits with the individual in question are supervised. PRACTICE GUIDANCEWhy are visits important?A childs confusion and anxiety can be greatly reduced by arranging some form of contact with birth family as soon as possible following placement. Doing so reassures a child that the parent is still available and concerned about him/her. Another psychological advantage for the child is that he/she senses parental permission to be placed away from the parent. This alleviates much of the guilt most children feel when placed. As always, safety of the child is a paramount concern when considering the benefits of parent-child contacts. Visits provide caregivers with opportunities to practice appropriate parenting behavior and obtain feedback. Visits provide the agency opportunities to assess parental readiness and capacity for reunification, which is documented in the case record and Case Plan. When supervising visits, the SSCM can assess how visitation affects the parent and the child, as well as the quality of the interaction. Visits are considered to be supervised only when there is direct oversight of the interaction between a child and the person(s) with whom the child is visiting. The person supervising the visit should be physically present for the duration of the visit and be able to see and hear everything that is occurring during the visit. The person supervising the visit should also be able to intervene quickly to protect a child from harm if a threat to a childs safety emerges at any point during a visit. Supporting ParentsThe SSCM has the responsibility to reach out to parents and assure that a pattern of regular visitation is established early in placement. The younger the child, the more frequent visitation is needed for the child to maintain a relationship with the parent. Parents may require strong encouragement and support to exercise their visitation rights. The parent who misses visits, shows up late, seems disinterested, etc., may be experiencing great discomfort at having to continually face the reality of having the child taken away. The parent may respond to a betterunderstanding of how important visitation is to the child when encouraged by the SSCM. Visits should be planned to allow meaningful parent-child interaction and the development of a positive relationship between the family and the placement resource. An incarcerated parent and parents living out of county/state retain visitation rights. It may be necessary for DFCS to arrange for or to provide transportation where agency resources permit. Pre-planning the visit with the parent, child and placement resource may be helpful. If the parent has difficulty relating to the child, the agency may be able to help the parent develop more effective ways to engage the child such as incorporating activities, games, etc. The parent and child may also need help understanding when and how to end a visit and say good- bye. Post-visit discussions with the child, parent and placement resource may be helpful when planning for the next visit.Professional validation is needed from a licensed therapist, psychologist, or psychiatrist before deciding that visitation with parents, grandparents, siblings, etc. is detrimental to a childs well- being. Maintain Open CommunicationOpen dialogue around the issue of visitation needs to be maintained among all parties involved. Visitation between parents and children may be stressful. The reasons for placement and separation may surface, along with strong feelings on the part of both the parents and children around those issues. Typically, children will express their feelings through their behavior prior to or following a visit (e.g., aggressiveness, temper tantrums, bed-wetting, angry outbursts, crying, etc.). Children who are particularly upset by visits may need additional assistance and support to verbalize their feelings about the parent, the reasons they are in foster care, and expectations regarding having visits with their family. Parent-Child Visitation (Parenting Opportunities)Limited contact between parents and their children is often anxiety provoking for children, and therefore more frequent visitation with their parents is best. Parents who visit frequently with their children have the best chance of being reunified with them. Visitation helps to facilitate bonding between parents and their children and provides opportunities for parents to practice parenting their children. Involving foster parents in developing the parent-child visits promotes partnership parenting, which builds supportive relationships. When reunification is the permanency plan goal, increased visitation with parents is critical to facilitate bonding and child wellbeing for children ages 0-5. Policy has established a required minimum frequency for visitation, but more frequent visitation is strongly encouraged. Other parenting opportunities should be provided for parents to practice learned skills/knowledge that can facilitate earlier reunification. Examples of other forms of meaningful contact include letters, cards, calls, email, Skype, social media, etc. Telephone contact is also encouraged, when it is safe and appropriate to do so. Discussions regarding the type and frequency of contacts should occur on an ongoing basis as the case progresses. Visiting ResourcesVisiting resources provide support for children in care through positive, supportive interaction. They may provide social and/or cultural experiences of short duration (not to exceed two consecutive days or a weekend) to a child with whom there is a relationship that has been determined to be positive and significant and does not interfere with permanency for the child.A decision to arrange/approve visiting resources must be in the best interest of the child. Once a visiting resource has been identified, an assessment of the resource must be completed prior to any visit occurring. PicturesDuring visitation, DFCS staff and service providers should take the opportunity to photograph a childs interaction with their parents, siblings, extended family, friends, etc. Each child should be encouraged to add the pictures to their Life Book, which will offer a record of their experiences in foster care. Pictures may also help provide parents with additional motivation to take the steps necessary to reunify their family as soon as possible. SkypeSkype is a service that allows users to communicate with other people over the internet by voice (using a microphone), by video (using a webcam), and instant messaging. There is no charge for calls between users within the Skype service. However, there is a charge for calls to landline telephones and mobile devices. Charges are processed via a debit-based user account system. Family Member Rights to VisitThe term family member encompasses grandparents, great-grandparents, siblings of the parents of a minor child in foster care. If DFCS does not grant family member visitation, the family member has the legal right to petition the court for visitation rights with a minor child when:The minor childs parents are separated or divorced;The parental rights of either parent have been terminated;The parent of the child is deceased; orThe child has been adopted by the childs blood relative or by a stepparent. Reasonable visitation rights between the family member and the child may be granted if the court finds:The health or welfare of the child would be harmed unless such visitation is granted; andThe best interest of the child would be served by granting the visitation request. NOTE: In no case shall the granting of visitation rights to a family member interfere with a childs school or regularly scheduled extracurricular activities. Fictive KinFictive kin means a person who is known to a child as a relative, but is not, in fact, related to the child by blood, marriage or adoption but who prior to his or her placement in foster care was known to the family, has a substantial and positive relationship with the child, and is willing and able to provide a suitable home for the child.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-10-foster-care-section-1019-visitation

Accordingly, the VCCR addresses notification to a consular officer when a minor is from a foreign nation. For the purposes of consular notification, a foreign national is defined as any child who is not a U.S. citizen. If DFCS obtains legal custody of a child who is a foreign national, federal obligations require that the foreign consulate be given notice. The VCCR requirements are mutual obligations with foreign countries. In general, you should treat a foreign national parent and/or child as you would like for an American citizen to be treated in a similar situation in a foreign country. The VCCR requirements apply to all foreign national citizens. Therefore, all foreign national citizens are entitled to consular notification and access, regardless of their visa, refugee, or immigration status in the United States. Some foreign nationals are afraid of their government. Consequently, DFCS must operate with extreme sensitivity to avoid putting any foreign national or members of their family in danger. Immigration and Nationality ActEstablishes procedures for the admission of lawful immigrants into the United States and provides registration protocols for undocumented immigrants present in the United States. United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)On March 01, 2003, USCIS officially assumed responsibility for the immigration service functions of the federal government. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 dismantled the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and separated the former agency into three components within the Department of Homeland Security: 1) USCIS; 2) Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE); and 3) Customs and Border Protection (CPB). USCIS was formed to enhance the security and improve the efficiency of national immigration services by exclusively focusing on the administration of benefit applications. ICE and CBP handle immigration enforcement and border security functions. Visit the USCIS website at www.uscis.gov to obtain the latest USCIS forms and immigration-related information. USCIS determines eligibility for SIJ status after processing the Form I-360 Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant* which includes a review of supporting documentation and the Juvenile Court order. USCIS also determines a Special Immigrant Juveniles eligibility for permanent resident status after processing the Form I-485 Application to Register Permanent Residence of Adjust Status*. Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) Status and Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR) Status Some children present in the United States without legal immigration status may be in need of social services after becoming victims of abuse or neglect. Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) status is an immigration classification that can be utilized as a step toward becoming a lawful resident of the United States. If sought, SIJ status needs to be obtained while the child is still under the jurisdiction of the Juvenile Court. In some cases, children may need to obtain SIJ status prior to turning 18 years of age to access certain benefits (e.g. federally funded foster care). To be eligible for SIJ status:The child must be under 21 years of age on the filing date of the Form I-360 Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant*.The child must be unmarried.A qualifying Juvenile court order must be in effect on the filing date of the Form I-360* and when the USCIS makes a decision on the application, unless the child aged out of the courts jurisdiction due to no fault of his/her own. The court order must be detailed and include the factual basis for the findings on parental reunification, dependency or custody, and best interests. It must be clear the court order was sought primarily for the purpose of child protection rather than primarily to obtain an immigration benefit.Alternatively, a child may submit separate findings of fact, records from the judicial proceedings, or affidavits summarizing the evidence presented to the court.The child must be inside the United States at the time of filing the Form I-360*. One applies for SIJ classification by filing the Form I-360 Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant* and supporting documents with the USCIS. Approval of the Form I-360* by the USCIS confers SIJ status, but does not confer permanent residency. In fact, a child with SIJ status must take additional steps in order to obtain lawful permanent resident (LPR) status with its associated Permanent Resident Card (aka Green Card) and other benefits. However, once a child is granted SIJ status, he/she is eligible to immediately apply for LPR status and work authorization. One can also apply for the LPR status at the same time as with the application for SJI status. One applies for LPR status by filing Form I-485 Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status* and supporting documents. If possible, Form I-485 should be filed at the same time as Form I-360*. Form I-485* must be filed and approved in order to obtain a Permanent Resident Card, which is a key step towards U.S. Citizenship. Without a Permanent Resident Card, undocumented immigrant children may not be eligible to work legally, attend college, or qualify for most state and federal benefits. The parent(s) of a Special Immigrant Juvenile may not receive any immigration benefit based on the relationship to the juvenile. United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Forms and Filing FeesForms and filing fees change periodically. To ensure you are using the latest version of a form or have the current filing fee for a particular form, visit the USCIS Web site at www.uscis.gov/forms-information. For more information regarding the latest filing fees view Form G-1055 Fee Schedule* at www.uscis.gov/fees. USCIS is funded largely by application, petition, and biometrics services fees. However, recognizing that some may not be able to pay the fees, requests for fee waivers are considered on a case by case basis. When requesting a fee waiver, you must clearly demonstrate an inability to pay the fee. To have USCIS consider a fee waiver, you must complete and submit identifying all fees the child is unable to pay. Explain why the child has no income (e.g. child is in the legal custody of someone other than one of his/her parents). For further guidance on fee waiver requests, visit the USCIS website at www.uscis.gov/feewaiver. PhotographsPhotographs submitted to the USCIS with petitions and applications must meet certain specifications:You must submit two identical color photographs of the child taken within 30 days of the filing of the application.The photos must have a white to off-white background, be printed on thin paper with a glossy finish, and be uncounted and un-retouched.Passport-style photos must be: 2x2 in size;Color photos with full face, frontal view on a white to off-white background;Head height should measure 1 to 1-3/8 from bottom of photo;Head must be uncovered unless the child is wearing a head covering as required by a religious order of which the child is a member.Using pencil or felt pen, lightly print the childs name and Alien Registration Number (A- Number) on the back of each photo. The Alien Registration Number is a number assigned by the Department of Homeland Security to any person who is not a citizen or national of the United States. It begins with the letter A followed by eight or nine numbers (e.g. A12 345 678). Legal ServicesThe Special Assistant Attorney General (SAAG) in your area and the DFCS Legal Services office are available for consultation regarding cases that involve undocumented immigrant children, but they are not authorized to represent the child in any manner in this process. Due to the intricate nature of the U.S. immigration system, it may be necessary to consult an outside attorney who specializes in immigration law. However, no government funds may be used to pay for the services of an immigration attorney. The United States Department of Justice has made a list of qualified organizations and attorneys who provide free legal services available at http://www.justice.gov/eoir/probono/states.htm. The list is maintained by the Office of the Chief Immigration Judge (OCIJ). Please be advised that the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) does not endorse any of the organizations or attorneys on the list. In addition, the EOIR does not participate in, nor is it responsible for, the representation decisions or performance of the organizations or attorneys on the list. In addition, other community based organizations may have free and/or reduced legal services to assist with immigration needs. FORMS AND TOOLSConsular Notification Form LetterForeign Consular Offices in the United States Free Legal Services Provider ListUnited States Citizenship and Immigration Services - ResourcesUnited States Citizenship and Immigration Services - Forms Information United States Citizenship and Immigration Services - Fee Information",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-10-foster-care-section-1017-service-needs-immigrant

Child safety and well-being should be the primary considerations when selecting a childcare provider or early education program. Therefore, select the highest Quality Rated program (www.QualityRated.org) available in the area of the childs foster care placement. If possible, choose a provider familiar to the child to minimize trauma associated with foster care placement. Timely communication is important. Any changes in a case should be reported to the appropriate DECAL or DFCS personnel as soon as possible to avoid undesirable outcomes. For instance, changes in circumstances may affect the eligibility for childcare and may create an overpayment if not reported timely. Bright from the Start: Georgia Department of Early Care and Learning (DECAL)Bright from the Start: Georgia Department of Early Care and Learning is responsible for meeting the childcare and early education needs of Georgias children and their families. It administers the nationally recognized Georgias Pre-K Program, licenses childcare centers and home-based childcare, administers Georgia's Childcare and Parent Services (CAPS) program, implements federal nutrition programs, and manages Quality Rated, Georgias community powered childcare rating system. The department also houses the Head Start State Collaboration Office, distributes federal funding to enhance the quality and availability of childcare, and works collaboratively with Georgia childcare resource and referral agencies and organizations throughout the state to enhance early care and education. For more information, go to www.decal.ga.gov. Childcare and Parent Services (CAPS)CAPS is available for all children in DFCS custody and is paid out of federal funds. CPA fosterparents are entitled to the same DFCS services that DFCS approved foster parents receive. A CPA foster parent may only receive CAPS for children in DFCS custody. Therefore, all communication regarding CAPS must come through the SSCM for verification that any children receiving CAPS are in Georgia DFCS custody. According to the CAPS policy manual, children in DFCS custody are to receive priority services and are not to be denied due to a lack of funding. Rates must not exceed the amount that the provider charges other customers who do not receive subsidies. Below are some examples of different types of childcare:Full-time;Night-time;Weekend;Before/after school;Full-day service for school-age;Part-time. The childcare need may be full-time, part-time, before/after school, etc. as long as it is needed on a regular, ongoing basis. CAPS eligibility criteria/guidelines apply. As long as a child is in DFCS custody, the caregivers activity is protecting the child, which eliminates the need to verify employment. See the CAPS Manual for guidelines. Below are some basic CAPS eligibility criteria:Child must be a resident of Georgia; NOTE: DECAL will only pay for childcare services provided within the state of Georgia. For exceptions please contact the Early Childhood Collaboration Unit.Child must be a citizen or legal resident of the U.S.;Child must have current immunizations;Child must be placed in a DFCS or CPA approved Family Foster Home or with kinship caregivers who are not foster parents; Children placed in other settings (i.e. intermediate treatment centers, etc.) are not eligible;Child must be under 13 years of age. NOTE: Children with special needs (evidenced by documentation from a licensed medical/mental health professional) and children with court-ordered supervision may be eligible to receive childcare services up to age 18. Formal Childcare ProvidersFormal providers are regulated and licensed by DECAL. Below are the major categories of formal childcare providers: Family Child Care Learning Home: This is a program that operates in a private residential home less than 24 hours per day. The operator receives pay for providing care for three to six children under 13 years of age or 18 years of age if the child meets the criteria for CAPS special needs or court-ordered supervision. Child Care Learning Center: This is a program operated by an individual or business entity recognized under Georgia law that receives pay for group care. It cares for seven or more children under 18 years of age for less than 24 hours per day. Licensed-exempt Programs:Programs owned and operated by any department or agency of state, county or municipal government (i.e. afterschool programs in public schools operated by public school systems, and programs operated by city or county park and recreation departments); andDay camp programs for children five years of age and older operated between school terms, whose primary purpose is to provide organized recreational, religious or instructional activities. Informal Childcare ProvidersChildcare services may be purchased from informal providers only in the following situationsNo other licensed care is available within a reasonable geographic area;The need for care is during non-traditional hours when licensed care is not available; orThe child in care is determined to meet the CAPS program definition of special needs. To qualify for CAPS reimbursement, informal providers must be at least 21 years of age and may provide care for no more than two unrelated or six related children for payment. Regardless of relationship, the total number of children may not exceed six. Informal providers are required to enroll with the CAPS program. Informal providers may be eligible to receive CAPS reimbursement for childcare services provided in their own home or in the childs placement. However, informal providers who provide childcare in the childs placement may not receive CAPS reimbursement unless they are related to the child (i.e. grandparent, aunt, uncle, adult sibling) and live outside of the placement. Irregular or Temporary ChildcareIrregular or temporary childcare is not eligible for (federal) CAPS reimbursement and is paid out of state funds. Consequently, no referral for childcare is sent to CAPS. State funds may be used to reimburse foster parents for childcare expenses associated with their training. Foster parent training is considered irregular childcare because it does not occur on a regular, routine basis (i.e. every month for a certain period of time). Use of state funds for anything other than foster parent training requires an approved waiver from the Early Childhood Collaboration Director. When state funds are used, the childcare expenses are paid out of the same program as a childs foster care per diem (i.e. UAS Code 501(IV-E) Family Foster Care, 502 (IV-B/State) Family Foster Care, 503 Initial (TANF) Family Foster Care, etc.). See the COSTAR manual on the Field Fiscal Services website for a full description of UAS codes. Caregivers are reimbursed via the foster parent invoice process for payments made directly to the childcare provider. Caregivers must attach original receipts to their monthly Foster Care Invoice (Pre-bill for CPAs) and reimbursement may not exceed Georgias maximum reimbursement rate. Georgia Head Start and Early Head Start ProgramsDFCS is partnering with the Office of Head Start and local Head Start/Early Head Start agencies. Georgia Head Start and Early Head Start programs provide comprehensive early childhood and family development services to children from birth to five years of age. Early Head Start serves infants, toddlers (under 3 years of age) and pregnant women and their families who have incomes below the federal poverty level. Head Start is a child-focused program and has the overall goal of increasing school readiness of young children from low- income families by enhancing their cognitive, social, and emotional development. Head Start programs provide a learning environment that supports children's growth in many areas, such as language, literacy and social and emotional development. Head Start agencies provide a range of individualized services in the areas of education and early childhood development;medical, dental and mental health; nutrition; parent involvement and family support. There are numerous organizations, including school systems, community action agencies and universities that operate Head Start and Early Head Start programs in Georgia. All Head Start and Early Head Start programs must adhere to rigorous and comprehensive federal Program Performance Standards. To participate in Head Start and Early Head Start programs, families must meet the Head Start Family Income Eligibility Guidelines. However, children in foster care, homeless children, and children from families receiving public assistance (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families or Supplemental Security Income) are categorically eligible for Head Start and Early Head Start services regardless of income. Every effort should be made to enroll children who are four years of age or younger in a Head Start (3-4 years of age) or Early Head Start (0-2 years of age) program. If the Head Start program does not operate during the summer, children should be enrolled in a licensed childcare facility during the summer months. Using these resources helps to promote early brain development in children and prepare them for entry into kindergarten, promotes safety by ensuring the children are in the view of mandated reporters, and provides regular respite for foster parents. Questions or inquiries related to Early Head Start and Head Start programs should be directed to the DFCS Early Childhood Collaboration Unit within the Well-Being Services Section at the state office. Georgias Pre-K ProgramResearch confirms that students in Georgias Pre-K Program, a nationally recognized, lottery funded pre-kindergarten program continue to exhibit positive outcomes through the end of kindergarten across all domains of learning. Georgias Pre-K program is available in all 159 counties of the state. Children who are Georgia residents and are four years of age on September 1 of the current school year are eligible to attend Georgia's Pre-K Program during this school year. Pre-K programs usually operate on the regular school system calendar for the length of a typical school day. Pre-K Programs may be offered at local public schools or through private providers of preschool services. Every effort should be made to enroll children who are four years of age in Georgias Pre-K program. For additional information about eligibility and enrolling a child in Georgia's Pre-K Program please visit the Enrolling in Georgia's Pre-K Program webpage. Receiving childcare payments for children placed in the home of the childcare provider Caregivers who may benefit financially from the ownership or operation of a childcare facility cannot be reimbursed for childcare provided to children placed in their home. This practice is based on the need for responsible stewardship of the states financial resources. Since foster parents already receive a per diem for the supervision of children placed in their home, they may not receive additional payment for providing childcare to those same children. Likewise, kinship caregivers may not claim childcare payments for providing childcare for a related child placed in their home while providing childcare for other children. FORMS AND TOOLSBright from the Start: Georgia Department of Early Care and Learning (DECAL) Childcare and Parent Services (CAPS) Maximum Reimbursement RatesChildcare and Parent Services (CAPS) Provider Published Rate Form (CAPS Form 61)CAPS Referral - Georgia SHINES Job Aid DFCS Head Start/Pre-K Referral Form",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-10-foster-care-section-1016-childcare-and-early

Each child caring institution (CCI) shall identify an individual to be the caregiver responsible for making such decisions for each child in their care. DFCS shall ensure caregivers receive written authorization before a child in DFCS custody travels outside of the State of Georgia or outside of the United States2.For out-of-state trips, written authorization shall be obtained from the childs birth parent and/or the Juvenile Court, when the child is in the temporary custody of DFCS. Written authorization may be granted by the County Director/Designee if the child is in the permanent custody of DFCS.Written authorization shall include express authorization for the caregiver to obtain emergency medical treatment for the child. NOTE: This requirement makes an exception for children whose placement borders another state whose close proximity makes traveling across the state line part of the caregivers normal routine.For out-of-country trips, written authorization shall be obtained from the childs birth parent and/or Juvenile Court, when the child is in the temporary custody of DFCS. Written authorization may be granted by the County Director/Designee if the child is in the permanent custody of DFCS.Written authorization shall include express authorization for the caregiver to obtain emergency medical treatment for the child. Caregivers shall not be subject to actions against his/her approval status for harm caused to a child in care who participates in an activity approved by the caregiver, provided that the caregiver has acted as a reasonable and prudent parent.Caregivers shall keep records on childrens needs, activities, and significant decisions to share with DFCS/CPA and discuss with the DFCS/CPA during regular communications. PROCEDURESDFCS Social Services Case Manager (SSCM) will:Review the reasonable and prudent parenting standard with the caregiver. Document this discussion on the Contact Summary page in Georgia SHINES, the Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information System.Discuss with the children, birth parents and placement providers any activities in which children are currently participating or are interested in participating. Identify the resources needed to support a childs participation in activities (e.g. financial, transportation, physical examinations, instrument, lessons, etc.).Identify any barriers to participation and find appropriate solutions.Support the caregiver, as needed, in identifying age and developmentally appropriate activities that would promote a childs personal and social growth.Encourage the input of the childs parent into the type of activities they would like their child to participate in and whenever possible, include them in the decision making.Ask children and their birth parents if they have any religious affiliation and address any concerns about the children participating in religious activities with the foster family. To the extent possible, allow children to attend their own church, synagogue, or other place of worship; Support participation by the birth parents.Consult with the birth parents before allowing their children to participate in significant religious rituals and activities. (e.g., Baptism)Ask caregivers to provide advance notice of plans to allow children in DFCS custody to participate in overnight outings exceeding two nights. Caregivers must have knowledge of where and with whom children are to be staying and the type of care and supervision they will be receiving at outings where the caregiver will not be present.The SSCM has the discretion to ask the caregiver for identifying information on the adults responsible for supervision at the overnight outing and screen their names to see if they have Child Protective Services (CPS) history or are listed on the Sexual Offenders Registry.Ask caregivers to provide advance notice of plans to travel out-of-state or out-of country. If the court and/or DFCS does not authorize a particular trip, the SSCM must arrange for a temporary placement for children during the time the caregiver is away.PRACTICE GUIDANCEThe Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act does not only focus on issues related to child sex trafficking. It also contains provisions that ensure that children in foster care have opportunities to participate in activities that are appropriate to their age and stage of development. Children in foster care should be able to participate in activities that promote personal and social growth, self-esteem, and independence as long as they are not identified as foster children (e.g. receiving public recognition for accomplishments, being photographed for publication in a yearbook, participating in community events). Extracurricular, Cultural, and Social ActivitiesParticipation in age appropriate activities helps children to develop their social, emotional and intellectual skills. Children should be encouraged to participate in extracurricular activities (e.g. sports, band, choir, 4-H and other school clubs, field trips, etc.), cultural activities (e.g. museum exhibits, dance recitals, plays, etc.) and social activities (e.g. YMCA, Boys and Girls Club, martial arts, bowling, movies, etc.). Unfortunately, some children in care may not have had previous experiences with engaging in such activities before entering foster care. Consequently, some may require special assistance with learning how to participate appropriately in such activities. When appropriate, birth parents should be allowed to participate in events and activities that occur in their childs life. This is in keeping with the concept of partnership parenting wherein foster parents work with birth parents to help enhance the birth parents parental capacities and provide them with parenting opportunities while their children are in foster care. Just like the children in foster care, some of their parents may not have ever had previous experience with participating in many events or activities with their children. Engaging the parents outside of court rooms and DFCS offices can help build positive working relationships and help birth parents experience the joy of parenting that may have been overshadowed stress and the trauma of having their children removed from their custody. Spiritual DevelopmentBirth parents of children in foster care retain certain residual rights, even though DFCS holds temporary custody. Determining the childs religious affiliation is one of these. If the child is under voluntary placement authority, the parent is to advise DFCS on the Voluntary Agreement to Place Child in Foster Care of the childs religious affiliation. If the wishes of the parent andother family members are unknown, then the foster parent and the SSCM must plan how to best meet the spiritual development needs of the child. When appropriate, parents should be allowed to participate in religious activities that occur in their childs life. Given that foster parents may hold personal spiritual beliefs that may differ from those of foster children or their birth parents, careful consideration must be given during the process of matching children and foster homes. By considering potential conflicts ahead of time, we may avoid placement disruptions or placing children in home where neither they nor their foster parents feel comfortable engaging in the spiritual practices of their choice. ",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-10-foster-care-section-1014-social-and-cultural

Children are considered truant when, during the school calendar year, they have more than five days of unexcused absences;Is suspended from school for more than three days or is suspended two or more times within a school year;Is released from a Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facility (PRTF) within the past 90 days;Is placed in a Child Caring Institution (CCI) and attends school onsite;Commits a major school offense resulting in expulsion:Report these events to the regional support network and the EPAC Unit for guidance regarding possible appeal.Work with the local educational agency and caregivers to secure alternative educational services for the child through a community agency.Is in grade 12 (under 18 years of age), has identified academic deficiencies, and needs intensive academic support to exit care with at least a high school diploma; or is above the age of compulsory school attendance (16 years of age) and is interested in pursuing a GED rather than a high school diploma.Attend and participate in the childs IEP meetings (where applicable). Provide parents advance notice of IEP meetings. If parents elect not to attend IEP meetings, they may wave their right through signature. If the whereabouts of parents are unknown, a diligent search is to be conducted (see policy 19.20 Case Management: Diligent Search).Encourage the placement resource to participate in IEP meetings as well. NOTE: A placement resource can serve as an education surrogate (see practice guidance: Education Surrogate).Contact the Education Support Monitor for consultation prior to the meeting.Ensure the school system provides an alternative means for the child to obtain educational services within the community of the school if the school has determined it is unable to meet the childs special needs.Ensure there is an understanding and documentation of the following at the end of the IEP meeting:The childs present level of academic performance;The reason(s) why the child is academically behind peers of the same age, if applicable;The kind of services and/or classroom interventions the school will provide;The amount and frequency of services (e.g., two 45-minute sessions per week in a social skills group);The person(s) who will be responsible for delivering the services;The timeframe for when the services will be initiated;Educational goals and objectives for the child;How the impact of the intervention will be measured and reported; andThe next course of action if the intervention does not work.Upload a copy of the IEP to SHINES External Documentation.Be proactive in avoiding school placement changes. Explore before/after school care that would make it possible for the placement resource to transport the child/youth to his/her home school.Monitor childrens educational issues in their school to identify emerging academic and behavioral issues; work with the school staff to address them to prevent escalation. Collaborate with the EPAC staff for ongoing educational support for children through consultation, inclusion in Family Team Meetings, Student Support Teams (SST), etc.Identify and address ongoing and emerging issues that may lead to placement disruptions.PRACTICE GUIDANCEEducational Stability for Children in Foster CareChildren and youth in foster care, like all other children and youth, need and deserve a positive school experience. It not only enhances their well-being, but also helps with their successful transition to adulthood. In addition, it increases their chances for personal fulfillment, economic self-sufficiency, and their ability to contribute to society. Research has shown that many children enter foster care already behind in school. In addition to the trauma of being removed from their homes, many of these children/youth experience frequent placement and school moves. Placement changes impact the child/youths school stability and increases their risk of falling further behind academically. To avoid this result, DFCS is committed to reducing school changes, which can be as traumatic as foster care placement. For many children school is a haven for safety, consistency, nourishment, and encouragement. A new school means getting to know more strangers, acclimating to even more life changes, navigating new social norms and possible changes in grading standards, books, and expectationsall while dealing with the fact that they are in foster care. Placement without regard to the educational implications can mean that the child is unnecessarily negatively impacted by having to attend a new school. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 (FCA) requires that children who enter foster care remain in the same school they were attending prior to the removal. The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) of 2015 requires State and local educational agencies to work with DFCS to ensure educational stability for children in foster care. Consequently, educational and child welfare agencies have a joint responsibility in this endeavor that requires consistent collaboration. Some considerations for county/regional leadership in supporting educational stability for children in care include but are not limited to:What efforts are being made to keep children placed close to their home schools?What efforts are being made to work with the local school districts to eliminate barriers to the child remaining in the same school if in the childs best interest? For example, the county should work with the EPAC Education Support Monitor to: Identify a county point person (liaison) to work directly with the schools to facilitate/address educational issues.Identify the local homeless education liaison if the child qualifies as a homeless youth under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act.Develop an effective process for ensuring that a child remains in their school of origin.Identify resources to provide transportation to the childs home school.Develop a process for how a child will be immediately enrolled with records transferred in cases where it is not in her best interest to remain in the same school.Create an interagency workgroup to identify obstacles and develop processes.Are there active ongoing recruitment and retention efforts to locate appropriate resource families and/or other foster care placements within the school jurisdictions or attendance areas from which children come into foster care, especially communities with higher incidents of Child Protective Services (CPS) reports, etc.?Is the agency partnering with the local school districts to help recruit families? Georgia courts have required the legislature to define what level of basic education will be provided to all students and to fund schools to provide this basic level of education. Local educational agencies cannot take away students right to education without providing them with an opportunity to dispute the removal from school. The SSCM must ensure childrens rights are protected. Local educational agencies must have a very good reason to justify the permanent or indefinite removal of a student from school. Educational Programming, Assessment and Consultation Unit (EPAC)The EPAC Unit provides comprehensive academic support services focusing on improving educational outcomes and the academic achievement of children in DFCS custody who are at least five years of age up until their 18th birthday. EPAC services are supported through Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) funding and are initiated through SSCM. Upon initial placement into foster care, children and youth are referred to EPAC for a comprehensive educational assessment and subsequently monitored for academic progress. Support regarding educational waivers is also provided, as needed. Education Support Monitors are assigned regionally to provide individualized case consultation, advocacy, and to assist case managers in linking children and youth to local education support services, while adhering to local school district policies and procedures. Additionally, EPAC is responsible for procuring educational services that include, but are not limited to, tutoring services. The following list outlines services provided through EPAC:Educational Assessment: Each child/youth who is referred for EPAC services receives an initial educational assessment. This assessment is provided by a certified teacher or authorized representative. It provides a comprehensive review of the math and reading performance of the child/youth.Educational Consultation to Case Managers: After a child/youth has received an initial educational assessment, the ESM assigned to the region will consult with the child/youths case manager to develop an Educational Stability Plan based on the results derived from the assessment.Educational Consultation to Executive Staff: EPAC will consult with DFCS County and Regional Directors and state office leadership to provide updates and consultation on the educational outcomes of youth served. These updates and consultations may assist in the development of educational policy and practice within the division and provide clarification and interpretation of local and state federal laws and statutes.Tutorial Services: When community resources, supplemental educational services, and other educational entitlements have been exhausted, children/youth in need of remediation or academic support receive additional tutoring services provided by a certified teacher. These pre-selected teachers (tutors) are identified as Educational Specialists who have individually established contracts with DFCS.Individualized Education Plan (IEP) Development: For children/youth in need of remediation and support services, the Education Support Monitor and case manager for that child/youth will work together to ensure that an Individualized Education Plan is developed for the child/youth (if needed). The Education Support Monitor will also work with the child/youths local school system to ensure this plan meets their current educational goals and objectives.Advocacy: The Education Support Monitor for each child/youth and the state office EPAC staff will work with local school systems and the Georgia Department of Education to ensure quality educational services are provided to youth in the custody of DFCS. Advocacy activities may range from helping to coordinate academic records for youth who have experienced multiple placements to helping develop an Individualized Education Plan for youth with identified special needs.Resource Coordination: Each Education Support Monitor will maintain an Educational Resource Directory for their region(s). This directory will provide additional support resources for their youth who need additional assistance. These resources may include academic support services, community-based services and child and family services.Best Interest DeterminationWhen determining whether it is contrary to the childs best interest to remain in their home school during placement into foster care or placement changes, consider the following:What historical and/or current information is available to make a best interest decision?What was the recommendation from the EPAC Educational Stability Plan and/or Educational Stability Checklist regarding the assessed educational needs of the child and what educational setting is best to meet these needs?Are there other needs (mental health, substance abuse, etc.) that cannot be met in the current setting and require a specialized placement setting?Are there familial or community violence concerns that threaten the childs safety/well- being?Is this a planned placement decision based on securing permanency for the child, reunification with siblings, placement with a fit and willing relative or an out of state placement?Has the decision to move the child included a school transitioning plan?Have the parent, caregiver, school representative, Education Support Monitor, etc. provided input in the best interest determination?Was the Education Support Monitor consulted prior to making a best interest determination at each change of placement?Is there a clear procedure at the local level for resolving disputes regarding whether a school change is needed? Does the procedure address the following: written decisions, notice to parents, and what happens to the child pending resolution of the dispute?Determining Appropriateness of an Educational SettingThe Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act requires that the childs current educational setting be appropriate. Consider the following when assessing and determining appropriateness of the childs educational setting:Does the child have special education or remedial education needs that can be supported in the current/prospective educational setting?Does the child need a gifted educational program, or require advanced placement classes? If so, is the current/prospective educational setting able to meet such needs?What documentation (reports, evaluations, assessments, etc.) is available to determine the appropriateness of the educational setting?What input has been obtained from the parent, caregiver, teacher, or other school representative to assess appropriateness of the educational setting?What is the parent/caregivers perspective/involvement regarding the childs educational needs?What efforts have been made to coordinate with the school/Department of Education?Has the school made recommendations for meeting the childs needs in the current setting or for transitioning the child to a more appropriate setting?High School Diploma vs. GEDEarning a high school diploma is the preferred certificate of secondary education completion for youth in care. Post-secondary education or training should be sought for those youth whose aptitudes and school records demonstrate they are willing and capable of benefitting from such educational opportunities. General Educational Development (GED) tests are a group of five subject tests in science, mathematics, social studies, reading and writing. Successful passage of the tests certifies that the test taker has high school level academic skills. It allows those who will not or did not complete high school the opportunity to earn their high school equivalency credential. If pursuing a GED is recommended or if the child desires to pursue a GED, the SSCM, EPAC Education Support Monitor, Independent Living Specialist, youth, foster parent, relative caregiver, or other provider should meet to discuss whether it is in the childs best interest. To be considered for a GED program the following conditions must apply:The program must be an approved/certified GED program.The youth must be at least 16 years old and cannot graduate by age 21.The youth has met all guidelines provided by local school districts and the Georgia Department of Education.The final decision must be documented, in the childs case plan and Written Transitional Living Plan and include a vocational, employment or other next steps plan including timeline and milestones. Trans",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-10-foster-care-section-1013-educational-needs

Ensuring educational stability for children in care requires partnership and creative collaboration between DFCS staff	 school officials and caregivers. The SSCM must enlist the assistance of the school and caregivers to provide for the childs transportation needs. Just Ask. Ask the school social worker	 the school principal	 Local Education Agency/School System point of contact for foster care related issues	 or other local educational agency officials what needs to happen to keep the child in the home school and what options are available for transportation. Also	 discuss transportation expectations with caregivers during the placement matching process. Before a placement is made	 the SSCM needs to know what support a caregiver is willing and able to provide regarding transportation. Refer to the Educational Stability Field Practice Guide	 and Educational Stability Transportation Funding Request Protocol for assistance. The McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance ActThe McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act is the primary piece of federal legislation that provides guidance on the education of children and youth experiencing homeless in U.S. public schools. The Act ensures educational rights and protections for homeless children. Under the Act	 State educational agencies must ensure that homeless children have equal access to the same free	 appropriate education (including public preschool education) as other children.The McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act provides covered youth with the right to:Remain in their school of origin until the end of any academic year	 or for the duration of the youth's """"homelessness	 whichever is longer;Receive transportation to their school of origin;School placement decisions guided by the """"best interest"""" of the youth with an aim to""""continue the child's or youth's education in the school of origin"""" unless doing so is contrary to the wishes of the child or his/her parent or guardian;Choose between the local school where they are living or the school where they were last enrolled;Immediate enrollment in the new school even if records normally required for enrollment are absent such as proof of residency	 immunizations	 school records	 or other documents;Prompt transfer of school records when a child enters a new school district;Receive various specified school services;Be free from harassment and isolation;Prompt resolution of any school placement disputes with ongoing enrollment in the school of origin pending resolution of those disputes. Every school district is required to have a local homeless education liaison. Issues or concerns regarding the local liaisons should be referred to the State Coordinator for Homeless Education. For additional information	 contact the EPAC unit.504 PlansThe """"504 refers to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act	 which specifies that no one with a disability can be excluded from participating in federally funded programs or activities	 including elementary	 secondary	 or post-secondary schooling. """"Disability"""" in this context refers to a """"physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more major life activities."""" This can include physical impairments; illnesses or injuries; communicable diseases; chronic conditions like asthma	 allergies	 diabetes	 and learning problems. A 504 plan specifies the modifications and accommodations that will be needed for these students to have an opportunity to perform at the same level as their peers	 and might include such things as wheelchair ramps	 blood sugar monitoring	 an extra set of textbooks	 a peanut-free lunch environment	 home instruction	 or a tape recorder or keyboard for taking notes.Response to Intervention (RTI)In education	 response to intervention (RTI) is a method of academic intervention used in the United States to provide early	 systematic assistance to children who are having difficulty learning. It was developed as an alternative to the abilityachievement """"discrepancy model	 which pertains to children who exhibit a discrepancy between their ability (often measured by IQ testing) and academic achievement (as measured by their grades and standardized testing). RTI seeks to prevent academic failure through early	 increasingly intensive research- based interventions with frequent progress measurement. It is believed that students who do not respond favorably to universally effective interventions are more likely (than students who do) to have biologically based learning disabilities that require special education. Individualized Education Plan (IEP)An IEP is a written plan designed to meet the unique educational needs of a child who may have a disability	 as defined by federal regulations. The IEP is developed	 reviewed	 and revised at a meeting of a team that includes school officials and parents. In all cases	 the IEP must be tailored to the individual student's needs as identified by the IEP evaluation process and must especially help teachers and related service providers (such as paraprofessional educators) understand the student's disability and how the disability affects the learningprocess. The IEP should describe how the student learns	 how the student best demonstrates that learning	 and what teachers and service providers will do to help the student learn more effectively. When developing an IEP	 it is important to assess students in all areas related to their known disabilities. Consideration should be given to the students ability to access the general curriculum	 how the disability affects the students learning	 developing goals and objectives that correspond to the needs of the student	 and ultimately choosing a placement in the least restrictive environment possible for the student. If a student qualifies for special education	 the IEP must be reviewed on an annual basis and updated over the student's primary educational years (i.e.	 up to the point of high school graduation	 or prior to the 22nd birthday). The requirements for development and implementation of an IEP are found at 34 CFR §§300.320 through 300.324. Educational SurrogateAn educational surrogate parent is a person appointed by a local school system to assume parental rights under the special education regulations in order to protect the students rights. The SSCM may not serve as an educational surrogate. When appropriate	 the birth parent may serve as the childs educational surrogate. DFCS will ensure that the foster parent or relative caregiver is aware of the benefits of serving as an educational surrogate to the child	 and that the ongoing training required to serve as a surrogate parent is appropriate. If the foster parent or relative caregiver is unwilling or unable to serve as the surrogate	 consider asking another foster parent or the local school system	 if the birth parent is not appropriate. Statewide Longitudinal Data System (SLDS)The Georgia Department of Educations SLDS captures education data including enrollments	 attendance	 course grades	 test scores	 and other relevant educational information. DFCS social services staff and others have access to this information (through Georgia SHINES) for children and youth in foster care. This tool should be used to assist in case planning and service delivery. Each youth enrolled in a Georgia public school is assigned a Georgia Testing Identification Number	 which is required to access each youths student level educational access page. Georgia Testing Identification Numbers may be retrieved from the person identifiers section of the Person Detail Page in Georgia SHINES. Parent PortalThe Parent Portal is a free online resource made available by local educational agencies to parents of students in grades K-12. The portal allows parents continuous	 secure access to information about their children and their academic career (e.g.	 grades	 attendance	 discipline reports results of standardized tests	 bus route	 etc.). Parents may also email their childs teacher directly from the portal. In order to access the portal	 a parent needs a computer or mobile device with internet access	 a user ID and password. Only authorized users with a user ID and password have access to a students records so this information should be kept confidential. Each local educational agency is unique	 so the functionality of the Parent Portal may vary. One should contact his or her local educational agency to find out how to register for the Parent Portal and other details. FORMS AND TOOLSThe 504 Plan for Students with DisabilitiesEducation Notification Form For School Age Youth in Foster CareEducational Stability Checklist to Assess Support Appropriateness of Educational Setting Educational Stability Transportation Funding Request ProtocolEnsuring Educational Stability for Children in Foster Care Field Practice Education for Homeless Children and Youth ProgramNational Association for Education of Homeless Children and Youth National Center for Homeless EducationNon-Traditional Education Approval Form ""	https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-10-foster-care-section-1013-educational-needs.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-10-foster-care-section-1013-educational-needs

They can alter a persons mood, thoughts, perceptions, emotions and behaviors. It is important to remember that although medications can play a role in treating several behavioral health disorders and conditions, treatment may also include psychotherapy (also called talk therapy) and brain stimulation therapies (less common). In some cases, psychotherapy alone may be the best treatment option. Choosing the right treatment plan should be based on a person's individual needs and medical situation. Treatment should always be provided under the care of a licensed behavioral health professional. When children enter care with behavioral health needs that warrant the use of psychotropic medication, the parents are usually aware of the childs condition. Nevertheless, there should be a discussion with them as well as the child and the caregiver prior to authorizing the use of psychotropic medication for a child in DFCS custody. Even though DFCS may have the legal authority to authorize the use of psychotropic medication as part of a childs treatment plan, having the support of the parent, child and caregiver will contribute to the success of the treatment plan. Since there may be strong feelings for or against the use of psychotropic medication, skill must be exercised to build a consensus. If no consensus can be reached, respectfully inform all parties that DFCS must take the course of action determined to be in the best interest of the child.When children are in a Crisis Stabilization Unit (CSU) or Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facility (PRTF), decisions regarding consent for the use of psychotropic medication must be made very quickly to avoid impeding a childs treatment. Therefore, consent should not be delayed by an inability to locate a parent or an inability to build a consensus with the parent, child and foster caregiver. Ideally, the discussion with the parent, child and caregiver should occur before the child requires in-patient treatment. Behavioral Health AssessmentsWhen a child enters foster care, it is extremely important to assess the childs psychological and behavioral health needs. There are various types of behavioral health assessments including Trauma Assessments, Psychological Evaluations, Psychiatric Evaluations, Psychosocial Evaluations, Substance Abuse Evaluation, etc. Each of these assessments must be completed by a licensed behavioral health provider. The Trauma Assessment serves as the baseline assessment for children five years or older entering foster care and can help identify whether other types of assessments are appropriate to meet the needs of a child. Trauma AssessmentTrauma can affect many aspects of a childs life and may lead to secondary problems that negatively impact safety, permanency, and well-being (e.g., peer relationships, problems in school, health related problems). The Administration for Children and Families (ACF), a federal agency in the Department of Health and Human Services, has informed state child welfare agencies of the need to implement trauma-focused screening, assessment and treatment for children in foster care. The emotional well-being of our children is of the utmost importance and is directly correlated to their ongoing safety and success of permanency plans. The trauma assessment identifies all forms of traumatic events experienced directly or witnessed by a child to determine the best type of treatment for that specific child. In addition to the trauma history, trauma-specific evidence-based clinical tools assist in identifying the types and severity of symptoms the child is experiencing. Examples of evidence-based, trauma-specific clinical tools include:UCLA PTSD Index for DSM-VTrauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC)Trauma Symptom Checklist for Young Children (TSCYC)Child Sexual Behavior Inventory The trauma assessment must provide recommendations and actions to be taken by DFCS to coordinate services and meet a childs needs. Behavioral health providers who conduct a trauma assessment will provide a report which includes:Trauma history, which informs the agency of information concerning any trauma the child may have experienced or been exposed to, as well as how they have coped with the trauma in the past and presentA standardized trauma screening toolSummary and recommendations for treatment (if needed) The inclusion of a trauma assessment as part of the CCFA does not mean there will not be situations in which other specialized assessment (e.g., psychological evaluations, psycho- sexual evaluations, psychiatric evaluations, neuropsychological evaluations, substance abuse assessments, psycho-educational evaluations, etc.) will be warranted. The decision to refer a  child for additional assessments must be made on a case-by-case basis in coordination with the CCT after an overall assessment of the childs needs has been completed. If it is determined that a psychological evaluation is needed, prior authorization must be obtained from Amerigroup for Medicaid to pay for it. Psychological and Neuropsychological EvaluationPsychological evaluations are not required for every child who enters care. However, the results of the trauma assessment may recommend a psychological evaluation. If so, the SSCM should collaborate with the Amerigroup CCT to refer a child to a licensed psychologist in- network. Amerigroup must provide prior authorization for any psychological evaluation; otherwise, Medicaid cannot be used to pay for the evaluation. Amerigroup will evaluate the medical necessity for the psychological evaluation based on the needs of the child and information already available. The Amerigroup CCT will coordinate any evaluation deemed necessary.

Requests for clinical services from the DFCS Care Coordination Treatment Unit may be submitted to cctu.support@dhs.ga.gov. The goals of the unit include:Assisting DFCS youth with severe emotional disorders, developmental disabilities, intellectual disabilities, medical complexities, and/or addictive diseases, with gaining access to an appropriate system of care in their communities, ensuring that they have access to appropriate therapeutic and placement services;Coordinating appropriate services for youth who will be discharged from a Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facility (PRTF) or Crisis Stabilization Unit (CSU) and returning to the community; andPartnering with agencies to facilitate effective referral and screening processes that will ensure continuity of care. Target Populations:RBWO Program Designation children/youth: MWO-SMFWOSevere Medically ComplexSubstance Abuse & Human Trafficking (CSEC)Specialized cases (populations) requiring out of state placement for treatment purposes, hoteling, 5+ placement disruptions and prevention casesPRTF & Acute HospitalizationsEmerging Dependent Adults 18-21 years old with I/DD, Severe MH, BH concerns Behavioral Support SpecialistsBehavioral Support Specialists within the DFCS Care Coordination Treatment Unit provide oversight and consultation for behavioral management issues for children in DFCS custody. They help DFCS field staff identify appropriate placement resources for children categorized as high-end with complex needs. They also provide additional support and oversight to RBWO providers to ensure that children are benefitting from therapeutic interventions and moving towards less restrictive placementsTherapeutic Support SpecialistsTherapeutic Support Specialists within the DFCS Care Coordination Treatment Unit provide intensive practice guidance and consultation to field staff on cases that require a meticulous level of insight to navigate the complexities within our state systems, policies and regulations. These specialists are responsible for immediate and on-going assessment of medical necessity, treatment and discharge planning of inpatient admissions to a PRTF, CSU or other acute inpatient behavioral or physical health facility. Wellness, Programming, Assessment, and Consultation (WPAC) UnitThe WPAC Unit provides practice support, consultation and quality monitoring of physical and moderate1 behavioral health needs of children and youth in foster care. Specific functions of intensive support and monitoring include:Training and consultation;Performance monitoring;Reviews, assessment and programmatic recommendations;Data tracking and trend analysis;Coordination and partnering during case staffing and case planning; andStrategic coordination with community partners. Local Interagency Planning Team (LIPT)A LIPT should be established on behalf of children in each community. The team may be single or multi-county teams depending upon the size of the community and geographic availability of needed resources. The purpose for the development of the LIPT is to improve and facilitate the coordination of services to children with severe emotional disorders (SEDs) and addictive disease. LIPTs have the following goals:To assure children with severe emotional disorders (SEDs) and addictive disease (ADs), and their families, have access to a system of care in their geographic area;To assure the provision of an array of community therapeutic and placement services;To decrease fragmentation and duplication of services and maximize the utilization of all available resources in providing needed services; andTo facilitate effective referral and screening systems that will assure children have access to the services they need to lead productive lives. Georgia law requires permanent membership of the LIPT to include a local representative from each of the following agencies:Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities (DBHDD);Division of Family and Children Services (DFCS);The Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ);The Department of Public Health (DPH);Georgia Vocational Rehabilitation Agency (GVRA);Local education agency (i.e., Public schools representative). In addition to the permanent members, the local interagency committee reviewing the case of a child or adolescent may include, as ad hoc members, the special education administrator of the school district serving the child or adolescent, the parents of the child or adolescent, and caseworkers from any involved agencies. 1 Less serious, severe, difficult, or extensive than others of the same kindHigh Risk: Behavioral HealthHigh risk youth regarding behavioral health are those who have been designated as having a severe emotional disturbance or substance use/abuse. This would include:A condition of severe emotional disturbance A mental or emotional disturbance listed in the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM V);Adult diagnostic categories appropriate for children and adolescents: Substance related disorders;Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders;Mood disorders;Anxiety disorders;Somatoform disorders;Dissociative disorders;Sexual and gender identity disorders;Impulse control disorders;Adjustment disorders;Personality disorders.Disorders usually first evident in infancy;Childhood and adolescence disorders (including pervasive development disorders);Attention Deficit and disruptive behavior disorders;Tic disorders;Stereotypic movement disorder;Feeding and eating disorders;Separation anxiety disorder;Selective mutism and reactive attachment disorder.Functional Symptoms and Impairment: Psychotic symptoms; Serious mental illness (e.g., schizophrenia) characterized by defective or lost contact with reality, often with hallucinations or delusions;Danger to self, other and property because of emotional disturbance: The individual is self-destructive (e.g., at risk for suicide, runaway, promiscuity, and/or at risk for causing injury to persons or significant damage to property).Functional Impairment in two of the following capacities (compared with expected developmental level): Self-care- manifested by a persons consistent inability to take care of personal grooming, hygiene, clothes, and meeting of nutritional needs;Community- manifested by a consistent lack of age appropriate behavioral controls, decision making and judgment, or involvement in the juvenile justice system;Social Relationships- manifested by the consistent inability to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with peers and adults;Family- manifested by a pattern of significantly disruptive behavior exemplified by repeated and/or unprovoked violence to siblings and/or parents, disregard for the safety and welfare or self or others (e.g., fire setting, serious and chronic destructiveness, inability to confirm to reasonable limitations and expectations, which may result in removal from the family or its equivalent);School and/or work: Inability to pursue educational goals in a normal time frame (e.g., consistently failing grades, repeated truancy, expulsion, property damage, or violence towards others);Inability to remain consistently employed at a self-sustaining level (e.g., inability to conform to work schedule, poor relationships with supervisor and other workers, hostile behavior on the job).Moderate Risk: Behavioral HealthAbout one fourth of youth between10-17 years of age fall into the moderate risk category regarding behavioral health. They tend to be experimenters. They commit minor delinquent offenses and occasionally use illicit substances, but not hard drugs. They may also be one year behind in school. Low Risk: Behavioral HealthAbout half of all young people fall into the low risk category regarding behavioral health. They do not commit any serious delinquent acts, do not use illicit substances, and are not yet sexually active. A small portion occasionally drink alcohol and a few are a year behind in school because of their birth dates or for developmental reasons. However, their risk for any significant negative consequences is minimal. HospitalizationWhen children require short-term, specialized hospitalization services to manage critical or immediate behavioral health needs, it is extremely important that DFCS staff is available and responsive to the hospital and treatment staff providing care to the children. In some cases, family members are not available to participate in treatment and support activities. Consequently, DFCS has the responsibility to fill in the gaps and ensure full engagement in the treatment process. Hospitals are places where children go to receive treatment and must not be viewed as foster care placements. Therefore, discharge planning should begin as soon as a child is admitted to a hospital or treatment facility. DFCS must ensure an appropriate placement option is available upon the childs release from the hospital so that the transition from the treatment facility to the placement occurs as smoothly as possible. Regardless of what day or time the discharge is scheduled to occur, a child should not be left in a hospital or facility after their treatment needs have been met.Georgia Families 360ËOn March 03, 2014, the Georgia Department of Community Health (DCH) transitioned from a standard fee-for-service Medicaid program to a statewide Medicaid Care Management Organization (CMO) through Amerigroup Georgia Managed Care Company. The transition impacted children in DFCS custody and children receiving AA as they became members of a new program called Georgia Families 360Ë. The new program is separate from Georgia Families, the general Medicaid program administered by DCH. Georgia Families 360Ë is designed to provide coordinated care across multiple services and focus on the physical, dental, and behavioral health needs of member children. The program is designed to ensure each member has a medical and dental home, access to preventive care screenings, and timely assessments. It also seeks to ensure medical providers adhere to clinical practice guidelines and evidence-based medicine.Amerigroup Care Coordination Team (CCT) and Care ManagersEach Georgia Families 360Ë member is assigned to a regional Care Coordination Team with aspecified Care Manager. The Amerigroup CCT members are Masters level staff, most whom    hold a professional license to practice in their respective field. The Amerigroup CCT completes a Health Risk Screening (HRS) on youth in care to identify medical and/or behavioral health needs. It ensures each child is assigned to a behavioral health services provider as needed. The Amerigroup CCT is responsible for coordinating the health components of the Comprehensive Child and Family Assessment (CCFA), including the initial physical, dental, and trauma assessment. Care Managers are the primary partner of the SSCM for identifying and making referrals for needed services. Care Managers ensure each youth has an individualized care plan that addresses both physical and behavioral health needs. They work with community agencies to ensure appropriate services are provided. Any services not authorized by the Amerigroup CCT will not be paid for out of Medicaid. Therefore, it is imperative that all behavioral health and developmental care be coordinated with the Amerigroup CCT to avoid any uncovered expenses. If a child is ineligible for Medicaid, then the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities (DBHDD) will provide behavioral health services to the child. FORMS AND TOOLSAuthorization of Psychotropic Medication for Children in Foster Care DFCS Teaming for Efficiency and Quality in Placement Matching Protocol Foster Care Individual Child Medication LogGuidelines for Psychotropic Medication Use on Children in Foster Care Human Trafficking Case Management Statewide ProtocolLocal Interagency Planning Teams (LIPT) Teams - Handbook Psychotropic Medication Management - Consent Process Flow ChartPsychotropic Medication Usage Parameters for Foster Children - Amerigroup",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-10-foster-care-section-1012-psychological-and

All children should undergo an initial physical examination performed by a primary care physician and receive well-child checks based upon EPSDT standards. Children 12 months of age and older should also undergo an initial dental examination performed by a licensed dentist. Children under 12 months of age should undergo dental screening instead of a dental examination. Dental screening may be performed by a pediatrician or primary care physician. However, once these children reach 12 months of age, they should undergo an initial dental examination performed by a licensed dentist. Development assessments are performed on children from nine to 36 months of age by the primary care physician according to the EPSDT periodicity schedule. Babies Cant Wait (BCW) also conducts Developmental Assessment Screening on children from birth to age three (see policy 19.28 Case Management: Children 1st and Babies Cant Wait). Copies of BCW assessments should be maintained in the case record. Many medically fragile children are under the care of medical specialists. Special services, equipment needs, medical supplies, etc., may be recommended by the physician as medically necessary due to a childs medical condition or diagnosis. Medical/Dental Coverage at Initial Entry into careChildren in foster care should be seen by Georgia Medicaid providers. The Medicaid program provides funds to the state for the costs of providing medical and some dental services to Medicaid eligible recipients. DFCS must utilize these funds for services to children entering DFCS custody to conserve state funds for those children not eligible for Medicaid (see policy 9.2 Eligibility: Applying for Medical Services at Initial Entry and Exit).Georgia Families 360ËOn March 03, 2014, the Georgia Department of Community Health (DCH) transitioned from a standard fee-for-service Medicaid program to a statewide Medicaid Care Management Organization (CMO) through Amerigroup Georgia Managed Care Company. The transition impacted children in DFCS custody and children receiving AA as they became members of a new program called Georgia Families 360Ë. The new program is separate from Georgia    Families, the general Medicaid program administered by DCH. Georgia Families 360Ë is designed to provide coordinated care across multiple services and focus on the physical, dental, and behavioral needs of member children. The program is designed to ensure each member has a medical and dental home, access to preventive care screenings, and timely assessments. It also seeks to ensure medical providers adhere to clinical practice guidelines and evidence-based medicine.Amerigroup Care Coordination Teams (CCT) and Care ManagersEach Georgia Families 360Ë member is assigned to a regional Care Coordination Team with a specified Care Manager. The Amerigroup CCT members are Masters level staff, the majority of whom hold a professional license to practice in their respective field. The Amerigroup CCT completes a Health Risk Screening (HRS) on youth in care to identify medical and/or behavioral needs. They ensure each child is assigned to a Primary Care Physician (PCP) and Primary Care Dentist, so every child has a medical and dental home. The Amerigroup CCT is responsible for coordinating the health components of the Comprehensive Child and Family Assessment (CCFA), including the initial physical, dental and trauma assessment. Care Managers are the primary partner of the SSCM for identifying and making referrals for needed services. Care Managers ensure each youth has an individualized care plan that addresses both physical and behavioral health needs. They work with community agencies to ensure appropriate services are provided. Any services not authorized by the Amerigroup CCT will not be paid for out of Medicaid. Therefore, it is imperative that all medical/dental, behavioral health and developmental care be coordinated with the Amerigroup CCT to avoid any uncovered expenses. See Field Fiscal Services COSTAR Manual Section 3100 Family Foster Care for an explanation of the Unusual Medical/Dental funding source for children who are not Medicaid eligible or who receive a service not covered by Medicaid. For youth covered by other forms of Medicaid (i.e., Fee-for- Service) or health coverage, the SSCM should utilize known providers in the community and contact the WPAC Unit for further support or assistance. Amerigroup Notification Form (E-Form)DFCS communicates with Amerigroup utilizing an electronic notification form (E-Form). It is the primary means for communicating information about a member enrolled in Georgia Families 360Ë. The E-Form must be completed and sent to Amerigroup within 24 hours of a youth entering foster care. It should be completed thoroughly to include demographic information, medical information, placement information, the identified CCFA provider and other referrals (e.g., Babies Cant Wait). The E-Form is also used to report updates such as placement changes, a youth exiting care, etc. If there is information not available at the time of the initial referral to Amerigroup, submit an E-Form (update) as soon as the information is obtained. Accurate and timely communication with Amerigroup is vital to the Medicaid eligibility determination and the assignment of an Amerigroup CCT and service providers. Important decisions regarding the assignment of primary care providers and referrals are made based upon the information submitted on the E-Form.Children 1stChildren 1st was created by the state of Georgia to improve the health conditions of children from birth through five years of age. Children 1st is the Single Point of Entry to a statewide collaborative system of public health, prevention-based programs and services, school, andcommunity-based organizations to identify children at risk for poor health or developmental outcomes. Children 1st identifies and screens children and links them to programs such as:Babies Cant Wait (BCW)Childrens Medical Services (CMS)Universal Newborn Hearing Screening and Intervention (UNHSI)Georgia Newborn Screening Program1st CareWomen, Infants, and Children Program (WIC)Referrals are submitted to the local Children 1st District Coordinator. A list of Children1st District Coordinators is available at http://dph.georgia.gov/children-first. Physical ImpairmentA physical impairment is defined as a dysfunction of the musculoskeletal and/or neurological body systems that affects the ability of an individual to move or coordinate movement. This includes one or more of the following body systems: neurological; musculoskeletal; sensory organs; respiratory, including speech organs; cardiovascular; reproductive, digestive, genito- urinary; hemic and lymphatic, skin; and endocrine. A physical impairment on its own does not make a child eligible for BCW services. However, if there is a significant developmental delay due to the physical impairment, then the child may be eligible.Developmental NeedsA developmental assessment is completed as part of the Health Check for children under four years of age who enter foster care. The assessment determines whether there are factors that may result in a developmental delay for a child or place a child at risk of delay. Any child in care [under the age of three] who has a suspected developmental delay, physical impairment or diagnosed disability must be referred to BCW via Children 1st for assessment. DFCS cannot provide consent for BCW services. Consequently, a surrogate parent or other appropriate adult may be needed to act on behalf of the child and provide necessary consents. See policy 19.28 Case Management: Children 1st and Babies Cant Wait.Developmental DelaysA developmental delay is a chronological delay in the appearance of normal developmental milestones achieved during infancy and early childhood, adjusted for prematurity in one or more of the following areas: cognitive, physical (including vision and hearing), communication, social/emotional and adaptive. Such delays may be caused by organic, psychological, or environmental factors. Example: If most children crawl by eight months of age and walk by the middle of the second year, then a child five or six months behind schedule in reaching these milestones may be classified as developmentally delayed regarding mobility. Significant Developmental DelayA delay is considered significant when it interferes with the childs ability to interact within his/her natural environment (relative to expected developmental sequences of cognitive, communication, adaptive, physical, and social-emotional development) to such a degree that ongoing development is compromised. In addition, secondary delays relative to the initial delay are likely to occur (e.g., significant delays in expressive communication may lead to compromised social skills with peers). Criteria for a significant delay include identification of deficits in skills which are instrumental in accomplishing later developing skills or functional tasks that would be expected of peers who are developing typically.If the use of standardized diagnostic measures is deemed appropriate, a score of two (2) standard deviations below the mean (average) in one of the five developmental domains, or at least one and a half (1.5) standard deviations below the mean in two or more of the five developmental domains constitutes a significant delay. The determination of whether a child has a significant developmental delay must be made by a qualified clinician. Sexual Health NeedsSexual and reproductive needs of youth in foster care are addressed through the initial and follow-up health screening. Youth in foster care may receive health education and risk prevention services through Georgias Personal Responsibility Education Program (GA- PREP), which provides high risk youth (ages10-19) free access to evidence-based teen pregnancy prevention programs and supplemental adult preparation subjects. Youth in care access PREP services through the agencys partnership with the Department of Public Health (DPH) Adolescent Health and Youth Development (AHYD) Program. GA-PREP is federally funded by the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) Family and Youth Service Bureau (FYSB).HIV Antibody TestingIf a child has signs or symptoms that may be consistent with HIV infection or whose health history places the child at-risk, the child must be evaluated by a physician to determine if testing is necessary and appropriate. Minors may receive HIV prevention counseling and testing services with or without parental consent. Whenever possible, parents should be involved in the counseling and testing. Local public health facilities with knowledgeable specialists in HIV may be contacted for consultation and information. The SSCM must recognize and understand the risk factors for HIV which may need to be brought to the attention of health care providers such as:The child was sexually abused by a person(s) from a high-risk group;The child has been engaged in sexual activity with high risk group partners;The child has a history of intravenous (IV) drug usage;The child was born to a parent from a high-risk group;The child is a hemophiliac.Almost all children who have become infected with HIV are infected prenatally by their mother. The maternal HIV antibody is present in children up to 18 months of age, resulting in a false positive. A true negative finding can only be made 18-24 months following birth, at which time seroconversion may have occurred. In other words, the childs body would have begun to produce specific, detectable antibodies in response to the presence of the virus. Primary health care providers should be able to care for HIV-exposed children and for most asymptomatic HIV-infected children with normal immune systems. As children become symptomatic, they will need the care of a pediatric infectious disease specialist. Since a child with a depressed immune system is at greater risk of suffering severe complications from routine childhood illnesses such as chicken pox and measles, the physician needs to be consulted when determining the setting that is best for the child and the degree to which that setting should be restricted. Usually, the benefits of an unrestricted setting outweigh the risks of the child acquiring harmful infections. Often, the infected child can be served in a foster home and attend school and/or day care. The results of HIV testing are confidential and may be released only to the following individuals:The childs parents/guardian/custodian (unless child is in the permanent custody of DFCS, then a decision is made on a case by case basis);Placement provider; andAny health care provider who has a legitimate need to know such information. Wellness, Programming, Assessment, and Consultation (WPAC) UnitThe WPAC Unit provides practice support, consultation and quality monitoring of physical and moderate behavioral health needs of children and youth in foster care. Specific functions of intensive support and monitoring include:Training and consultation;Performance monitoring;Review, assessment and programmatic recommendations;Data tracking and trend analysis;Coordination and partnering during case staffing and case planning; andStrategic coordination with community partners. High Risk: MedicalHigh risk youth are those with significant medical conditions or illnesses. Medical issues that contribute to children being considered as high risk include:Down Syndrome Cerebral Palsy Multiple Sclerosis Spina Bifida Fragile X Syndrome Von Willebrand Disease Sickle Cell Osteogenesis Imperfecta Rickets Cancer Diabetes Hypoxia Neurological disorders Epilepsy TBI Respiratory Illness Respiratory Failure Asthma Gastrointestinal Illness Short Gut Syndrome Failure to thrive Feeding disorders Birth defect to organs Organ failure Organ transplants Mechanically/Technology dependent¦Gtube dependent Trach and/or Vent dependent Portacaths Physically disabled children  Consent for Surgical and Non-Surgical ProceduresIn general, DFCS can give permission or consent for medical care deemed appropriate or necessary by competent medical authorities. Moreover, some court orders contain language that explicitly gives DFCS the authority to provide consent for ordinary medical care. This usually involves non-surgical procedures or routine surgical procedures that are considered low-risk. However, when consent for extraordinary medical care (e.g. major surgery, potentially life-threatening procedures) is needed, it should be sought from a parent or the court. Even when DFCS has the legal authority to make medical decisions regarding children in DFCS custody, such authority must be exercised in a manner consistent with family-centered practice. Families should always be involved in the decisions affecting their lives. This applies to parents and the children. Decisions should always be based upon what is in the best interestof the child. FORMS AND TOOLSBabies Cant WaitBirth Family Background Information for Child Children 1stDepartment of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities (DBHDD) Medical Homes Ensure Better Health Care for Children ",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-10-foster-care-section-1011-medical-dental-and

The assessment provides the SSCM and the family with a greater understanding of how a family's strengths, needs, and resources affect the child's safety, permanency and well-being. It is strengths- based, family-centered, culturally competent, individualized, and developed in partnership with the family. The strengths identified provide the foundation upon which the family can make changes. The assessment also involves the extended family, formal and informal support. The information gathered guides the family and SSCM in:Identifying what must change to mitigate or eliminate the safety threats.Addressing the effects of maltreatment.Addressing the effects of the childs removal.Eliminating or reducing the risk of maltreatment reoccurring.Providing the foundation for providing appropriate services.Developing the case plan. When a child enters foster care, it is extremely important to obtain as much information about the child and family as soon as possible. The SSCM must engage parents/caregivers at the time of removal and each subsequent contact to obtain a complete picture of each childs needs. The SSCM must be knowledgeable and resourceful in utilizing and developing resources to enable children to achieve the highest level of functioning possible. This will involve working in partnership with birth families, placement providers, service providers, medical professionals and other community partners. Gathering InformationExplore all sources of possible information about the family that will assist in conducting a family assessment, especially any existing FFA. It may require obtaining a signed Authorization for Release of Information form. Some ways of obtaining information include:Consulting with the previous Case Managers, Supervisor or other DFCS staff familiar with the family.Reviewing past CPS and Foster Care history.3.   Making collateral contacts with individuals/agencies that know or have worked with the family.Interviewing the family and observing family interactions, living conditions, behaviors, etc.Accessing reports and records generated from other agencies and/or other professionals.Reviewing formal evaluations and treatment summaries (e.g., medical, psychological, drug and alcohol assessments, etc.).Accessing any other source of information pertinent to the assessment process. Family EngagementChildren as well as their immediate and extended family should be engaged in the assessment process to develop a complete picture of the family. Family-centered approaches are effective ways to involve the family in assessment, planning and decision-making around the needs of the child (see policy 19.3 Case Management: Solution-Focused Family Team Meetings). One early and important step is to make sure the parent/guardian/legal custodian and the placement provider know who will be completing the CCFA. If the CCFA is being completed by a provider, DFCS should make every effort to introduce the provider to the parties involved as soon as possible. Face-to-face introductions are preferred and help providers establish working relationships and support timely completion of the CCFA. Engage families with the understanding that situations resulting in a child entering foster care are associated with the challenges of everyday life events that all caregivers face (see policy 19.2 Case Management: Family Developmental Stages and Tasks). The assessment information also assists judges, CASAs, citizen panels, and other providers working with the child and family to gain a better understanding of the: Situations in everyday life that are difficult for the family and the exceptions;Parental capacities and child vulnerabilities;Degree of parent-child attachment and the childs sense of belonging;Childs extended family as a potential resource for support and/or placement;Familys history and/or patterns of behavior (e.g., prior CPS involvement or foster care placements, past experience with handling crisis, problems with addiction, criminal behavior, etc.);Strengths and resources which the family can engage;Core needs of the family which, at a minimum, must be changed or corrected for the child to be safely returned within a reasonable period of time;Challenges impacting the success of a reunification permanency plan; andMedical, emotional, social, educational and placement-related needs of the child. Kinship AssessmentThe CCFA should identify kin to be explored as possible placement, visitation and/or permanency resources. With supervisory approval, a case manager may request a CCFA provider to complete the Kinship Assessment. The Kinship Assessment must be requested as part of the CCFA in order to utilize the CCFA funding source.

The placement resource must be able to meet the safety, permanency and well-being needs of the child and consider the needs of the childs family (as related by blood, marriage or adoption). Having a good understanding of the childs individual needs and the strengths of the placement resource can promote placement stability and reduce the likelihood of placement disruptions. The ideal placement resource will be in the community from which the child was removed to assist with maintaining the childs connections to immediate and extended family, educational, medical, dental and mental health providers and meet the childs religious, and cultural needs. The placement should be near the parents, guardians or legal custodians to maintain connections and promote frequent visitation and participation in meeting the well-being needs of the child. Reunification is more likely to occur when frequent and consistent visitation between the parents, guardians or legal custodians and child occurs and the child is placed within proximity to them. The most appropriate, least restrictive setting offers the child an opportunity to be placed where there will be a minimum of disruption to his/her family life and an assurance that the child will be afforded safety, permanence, and overall well-being. Clinical and support services within the community can be utilized to maintain the child in the least restrictive placement and should be evaluated for their effectiveness. The selected placement resource should also be consistent with the best interests and special needs of the child. The SSCM must always consider a caregivers current circumstance, capacity and ability to ensure the childs safety and well-being. Whenever there is a concern about safety of children and/or family members, it must be addressed with a focus on the caregivers ability to immediately improve and change conditions for children. Safety should continue to be the focus throughout the life of the case.1 Placement with kin or other committed individual is, often the first choice, especially when the prospective kinship caregiver and the child are already attached, bonded, and comfortable with each other; the prospective kinship caregiver lives near the childs current residence which preserves the childs friendships, school, and community connections; and the prospective kinship caregiver is willing and able to provide for the childs needs. Placement with kin minimizes trauma for the child during their time in foster care by allowing them to be cared for by someone they know and trust and maintain connectedness long after the child exits care to permanency. The practice of assessing kin or other committed individuals supports theagencys reasonable efforts to preserve or reunify families. A growing body of research confirms that, in most circumstances, placement with kin or other committed individuals is the best option when children cannot remain with their parents. Several studies have found that children in these types of placements are better able to adjust to their new environment and are less likely to experience behavioral problems and psychiatric disorders than those in the general foster care population. Finally, children placed with kin experience fewer school disruptions than children in non-kinship foster care, and their sense of identity and self-esteem is reinforced.2 When children enter foster care and the diligent search has identified kin, it is critical that the agency take all necessary steps to assess to determine if they would be an appropriate placement resource as soon as possible. Oftentimes, more than one relative, fictive kin or other committed individual may request to care for a child in foster care. When there are multiple kinship placement resources available, consider the following caregiver capacities and family dynamics when selecting a placement:Is the kinship caregiver able to avoid displacing their feelings and history with the childs parents onto the child?Will the child be exposed to positive or negative family legacies/cycles while in the kinship caregivers household?Has the child frequently resided in the kinship caregivers home or has the child been previously placed with the kinship caregiver?How well does the childs needs, routines and schedule fit within the current activities of the kinship caregivers household?Will the kinship caregiver be able to meet and comply with agency goals for reunification and/or another permanency plan?Does the kinship caregiver understand and agree to the need for a legal relationship with the child (i.e. adoption or guardianship)?Is the kinship caregiver willing to care for the childs siblings, if applicable, and/or maintain sibling connections?What support systems are in should the kinship caregiver require respite?What supports or alternative plans/agreements are in place if the kinship caregiver becomes ill or deceased? Timeliness of Relative PlacementsGeorgia law balances the priority of kinship placements against the childs need for placement stability, attachment, and connections. DFCS has the obligation to search for relatives quickly and notify those relatives as soon as possible that a child related to them is in state custody and in need of a placement. Relatives should also be notified that if they do not quickly come forward and take steps to visit with the child, participate in their case, and make themselves available as a placement, they may lose any priority as a long-term or adoptive placement that they would otherwise have. If a relative is notified and does not begin taking an active role in the case within six months,the court can determine that this relative is not an appropriate placement for the child. If the child has been in a stable foster placement in excess of 12 months, the court can determine that the child should not be moved absent a dangerous situation. SSCMs and supervisors should consult with SAAGs, attorneys, and the court whenever such situations arise. In cases where relatives come forward within six months of receiving notification and take active steps to assist as a resource and placement for the child, the relative will retain priority over other potential permanent placements even if the process for obtaining placement approval is slow, as it may be in ICPC situations. When a child has been with a stable foster family for 12 months, the county should initiate case consultation, permanency roundtables or other methods for staffing with regional leadership to determine the best interest of the child. In balancing the importance of kin connectedness and the bond that the child has established with a foster family, considerations should be given to the relationship between the child and the prospective kinship caregiver, the validity of the delay in assessing the kinship caregivers home and the foster parents openness to maintaining connections should the child remain in their home. SSCMs should clearly present to the court the process used to determine the recommended placement, the factors considered in making the placement decision that is in the best interest of the child and the final agency recommendation at permanency reviews and hearings set for the purpose of considering a childs placement. Kinship CaregiversA kinship placement refers to placement of a child in the home of a relative or fictive kin through an approved Kinship Assessment or approved kinship foster home. Exploration of all possible kinship caregivers is critical and must be expedited to maintain and promote family continuity. It is critical that kin understand we are seeking not only for them to become a placement for the child, but also a potential permanent home if reunification is not possible. If a relative fails to demonstrate an interest in and willingness to provide a permanent home for a child within six months from the date he or she receives the required notice that the child is in foster care, the court may excuse DFCS from considering the relative as a placement (see policy 19.20 Case Management: Diligent Search). Research shows that children thrive best in their families. It has been the practice of kin to care for a related child when their parents cannot. Preserving relationships with family members and kin is crucial to a childs sense of safety and well-being. DFCS is committed to developing strong partnerships with extended family to better serve the needs of children placed in foster care. In preserving the childs family ties, DFCS is supporting and promoting the childs need to feel and experience a sense of belonging, reduce the long-term negative effects of the childs separation from their parents and allow for continued connection between the child, their family, and the community. Family continuity and permanency planning focuses on achieving a level of stability in the childs life. By ensuring the child is safe, protected and in a wholesome living environment, the childs permanency is assured. Supportive services are also provided to the family with the intent of establishing and achieving a permanency plan for the child. For financial and non-financial supports, available for kinship placements refer to policy 22.8 Kinship: Financial and Non-Financial Supports for Children in Foster Care or Who Have Achieved Permanency. Foster Family HomeTypes of foster family homes include:Kinship foster home: Kinship foster homes approved by DFCS or a CPA for the temporary placement of a related kin child.DFCS foster home: non-relative foster homes approved by DFCS for the temporary placement of children in foster care.CPA foster home: Foster homes approved by a CPA contracted with DFCS for temporary placement of children in foster care. Kinship foster homes are relatives or fictive kin of the child who are approved as a foster parent by DFCS for the placement of the child that is in foster care. DFCS encourages all relatives and fictive kin to become approved foster parents. If a kin is interested in becoming a foster parent, the placement SSCM and the Kinship Coordinator partners closely with resource development staff to support them through the approval process. The kin should attend an information session to gather information required for fostering (see policy 14.7 Resource Development: Inquiries and Information Sessions). A non-related foster home is considered the least restrictive (most family-like) setting when relatives or fictive kin are not available or appropriate as a placement resource. A foster home placement offers experiences inherent in family living which are essential in achieving maturity and the ability to initiate and sustain a family of ones own. Children who have special needs, but can benefit from family life, can have their needs met in a foster home. DFCS and CPA foster homes should be equally considered as placements for a child based on a determination of the homes level of capacity to care for the childs emotional and physical needs; the proximity of the home to the childs community of origin; and the childs best interests. DFCS or CPA Adoptive HomeAn adoptive home is approved for the foster care placement of a child for whom the established goal is adoption. Adoptive homes must meet the regular standards of care required for approved family foster homes as outline in policy 14.1 Resource Development: Safety and Quality Standards. Child Caring Institution (CCI)A CCI is any child welfare facility which provides full-time room, board and watchful oversight (RBWO) to six or more children up to 18 years of age. Some CCIs are approved to care for youth up to age 21. The CCI must be approved through the Office of Provider Management (OPM) to serve children in DFCS custody (see policy 16.6 Room Board Watchful Oversight (RBWO): Age Requirements for Child Care Institutions (CCI)). Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facility (PRTF)A Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facility is a temporary non-hospital facility with a provider agreement with a State Medicaid Agency to provide intensive therapeutic intervention to a child to ensure safety and stability. PRTFs offer intensive behavioral health services to children in Georgia. ",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-10-foster-care-section-104-selecting-placement

Additionally, placement stability is especially important for youth success in foster care. Youth who experience minimized placement changes are more likely to experience fewer school changes, less trauma and distress, less mental health and behavioral problems and increased probabilities for academic achievement and experiencing a lasting positive relationship with adults. For children in foster care, the number of placements, or places where they live, can impact daily functioning and adjustment as well as the time to achieve permanency.

GA :: Child Welfare Policy Manual :: Chapter 10 Foster Care :: Section 10.3 Changes in Placement,Georgia,Rules,"2023, 2022","Forms - Other, Placement",,,"t in separation from siblings	 relocation to a new geographical area	 and experiencing a sense of not belonging; all of which can lead to distress and have a profound adverse emotional impact. Because of the seriousness of the long-term consequences for children	 placement stability is one of the permanency outcomes in the Child and Family Services Reviews (CFSR). It is essential that SSCMs make every effort to maintain stabilized placements for children in foster care. Some tips for placement stability are:Prioritizing placements with non-custodial parent	 kin or other committed individuals.Early and detailed assessments of the needs of the child	 identifying risk factors to assistProviding support and training for caregivers. This involves but is not limited to the following: Anticipating caregiver needs based on knowledge of the childs needs and proactively providing support;Responding timely to caregiver requests for support and intervention;Identifying red flags that can escalate without intervention;Providing or referring the caregiver for training on caring for special or new needs of the child.Conducting frequent purposeful contacts with children and caregivers.Ensure frequent parent/child	 sibling visitation	 as appropriate.Providing timely services to address behavioral health or other needs the child may have.Providing services to the child and caregiver to assist in addressing conflicts. Placement ChangesWhen the child experiences a placement change and must be moved to another placement	 careful planning and preparation must occur to assist the child through another loss. Pre- placement preparation eases the childs transition and lessens his/her fear and confusion. Whenever possible	 the SSCM	 placement resource and parent	 guardian or legal custodian should all be involved in the placement change process. Taking the time to engage in pre- placement efforts better ensures that an appropriate match between the child and the placement resource has been made and reduces the likelihood of unnecessary placement moves for the child while in foster care. Placement moves experienced by a child may revive earlier feelings associated with past separations and entry into foster care. Helping a child express his/her feelings and concerns	 as well as finding appropriate ways to grieve	 will also make the placement transition smoother. The SSCM or other trusted adult should encourage the child to discuss his/her feelings regarding the placement move and allow the child to have input. Although the placement decision is the responsibility of DFCS	 the child may have suggestions on placement options or ideas that would help assure placement stability and ease the childs apprehension regarding changing placements. Placement Change Discussion with the ChildThe placement change discussion with the child should include:An age-appropriate explanation of the placement change	 when it will occur	 why it is necessary and how it will occur.Whether siblings in care will be placed together and/or change placements with the child.A description of the home or facility where the child will be placed to help the child better understand what to expect.Information about the people who live in the home or facility	 showing pictures if available.A description of the community	 including the school the child will be attending	 if it is different from the childs current community or school.Any feelings or concerns the child may have related to the placement change.An explanation as to when the pre-placement visit(s) will occur	 if possible	 and how the child will be transported to the home or facility.Information about when the next contact with the parent	 guardian or legal custodian will take place.The identification of transitional objects such as toys	 pictures	 stuffed animals or other familiar items that give the child some sense of security during the move.How the child and current placement resource will maintain a relationship after the placement change when it is in the childs best interest.Any questions the child may have.Placement Change Discussion with the Current Placement ResourceThe placement change discussion with the current placement resource should include:A discussion of the issues that precipitated the need or request to change placements.A discussion and notification of the right to request a court hearing related to placement move decision and the process for requesting the hearing.An explanation when the placement change will occur and how it will occur.Whether siblings currently placed in the home will also be moved.Any feelings or concerns the placement resource may have related to the placement change.Whether they are willing to be contacted by the new placement resource for the purpose of sharing information with them.How they can maintain a relationship with the child when it is in the childs best interest.Their ability to participate in pre-placement visits to assist the child in transitioning to the new placement.Any questions the placement resource may have. Notice of Change in Placement HearingsChildren aged 14 and older; Parents	 unless parental rights have been terminated; Guardians or other legal custodians; Persons/agency with physical custody of the child (i.e. kinship caregiver	 foster parent	 child placing agency (CPA) and/or child caring institution (CCI)); Guardian Ad Litem (GAL); and all attorneys of record	 are entitled to file an objection to a placement change and participate in the resulting court hearing. At the hearing requested as a result of a placement change	 the court shall consider the case plan and permanency plan recommendations made by DFCS	 including a recommendation as to the placement of the child. The court may consider any evidence	 including hearsay evidence	 that the court finds to be relevant	 reliable	 and necessary to determine the needs of a child adjudicated as a dependent child and the most appropriate case plan and permanency plan. The court may also consider evidence presented by the child	 foster parent	 relative or caregiver objecting to the placement change. The court shall make findings of fact upon which the court relied in determining to reject or accept the case plan or permanency plan and DFCS recommendations	 including the location of the child's placement. If the court rejects DFCS recommendations	 the court shall demonstrate that DFCS recommendations were considered and explain why it did not follow the recommendations. If the court rejects the DFCS case plan and permanency plan recommendations	 including the change in placement of a child adjudicated as a dependent child	 the court may order DFCS to devise a new case plan and permanency plan recommendation	 including a new recommendation as to the placement of the child within the resources of the department	 or make any other order relative to placement or custody outside the department as the courtfinds to be in the best interests of the child and consistent with the policy that children in DFCS custody should have stable placements. If the court finds that the child has been living in a stable home environment with the current caregiver(s) for the past 12 months and that removal from the caregiver(s) would be detrimental to the childs emotional well-being	 the court may presume that continuation of the childs placement with the current caregiver is in the childs best interests and shall enter a finding that a change of placement is a failure by DFCS to make reasonable efforts to finalize the permanency plan in effect at the time of the hearing; provided however	 that such presumption shall not apply to prevent the return of the child to his or her parent	 guardian	 or legal custodian. Respite CareRespite care placements are intended to be temporary in nature	 therefore the child should return to his/her original placement within a short period (see policy 14.18 Resource Development: Supervision of Children for a definition of respite). If a child is moved to a temporary placement until a more permanent placement is located	 this temporary placement is not considered a respite placement	 but rather a placement change; thus	 the change in placement notification requirements apply. As soon as it is determined that a respite care placement is going to become the childs new placement	 notice must be given. The DFCS SSCM should provide placement change notification as soon as they become aware a child is changing placements or a child cannot return to his/her original placement. FORMS AND TOOLSAgreement SupplementAmerigroup GA Families 360º DFCS Referral Form Notice of Change in PlacementRoom	 Board and Watchful Oversight Placement Agreement""	https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-10-foster-care-section-103-changes-placement",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-10-foster-care-section-103-changes-placement

The signing of the Voluntary Placement Agreement to Place a Child in Foster Care form (VPA) by parent(s)/guardian(s) or legal custodian(s) avoids court action and allows foster care services to be provided for a limited period. DFCS is under no obligation to accept a VPA. A VPA is executed when the parent(s), guardian(s) or legal custodian(s) and the county department sign the form, Voluntary Placement Agreement to Place a Child in Foster Care. If DFCS must file a dependency petition because the parent, guardian or legal custodian is unable or unwilling to obtain custody within 180 days, the judicial determination that continued placement in foster care is in the best interest of the child must be made and documented in the court order within 180 days of a childs entry into foster care via VPA. Another judicial determination of reasonable efforts to finalize the permanency plan (see policy 9.5 Eligibility: Reasonable Efforts) is required within 12 months of the VPA signature date (and every 12 months thereafter), to maintain IV-E payments. DFCS Requests to Terminate the VPADFCS must determine if a familys circumstances warrant their child voluntarily entering foster care. Likewise, ongoing assessment of those circumstances must occur to determine whether the issues requiring the VPA have been resolved or if the circumstances have changed such that the family is no longer in need of the VPA. If at any time a SSCM finds there is no longer a need for voluntary foster care, in consultation with the SSS, the SSCM will notify the parents in writing. The family will have 14 days from the notice to take custody of their child. Missing Child or Youth During a VPAIf a child goes missing during a VPA:Follow policy 19.22 Case Management: Missing Children.If the child has not returned or been located by the expiration of the VPA, custody reverts to the parent(s)/guardian(s) or legal custodian(s).If the parent requests an extension, the VPA may be extended up to an additional 90 calendar days based on the individual circumstances of the case, with the county directors approval. An extension cannot be granted if the child went missing after the VPA was extended as the VPA cannot exceed 180 days. When deciding whether to extend the VPA consider: Length of time the child has been missing.Whether the parents are participating in services and actively working on their case plan outcomes.Prior to the 180th day the case must close if the child has not returned. FORMS AND TOOLSVoluntary Placement Agreement to Place a Child in Foster Care (Authorization)Voluntary Placement Agreement to Place a Child in Foster Care (Authorization) (Spanish) Voluntary Placement Agreement to Place a Child in Foster Care (Termination)Voluntary Placement Agreement to Place a Child in Foster Care (Termination) (Spanish) ",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-10-foster-care-section-102-placement-child-voluntary

Typically, a child entering foster care blames himself/herself for what has happened, and fears are exaggerated in the childs mind. Removal may be equated with the permanent loss of family. Because of the trauma of removal, the child will need help with the grieving process and its stages of shock (denial), bargaining, anger, depression and eventually, coping with and understanding the loss. A child, who is unable to express his /her feelings about separation and loss, often acts out the pain through problematic behaviors, physical symptoms and ailments. The placement process must be carefully managed to minimize the impact of separation and loss experienced by both the child and his/her parent, guardian or legal custodian. This initial placement period requires intensive intervention by DFCS to minimize trauma while determining the safety, permanency and well-being needs of the child and family. The CPS and Permanency SSCM should coordinate a joint visit where parents, guardians or legal custodians are engaged in potential placement identification, pre-placement discussions and are asked to provide details and items that will aid in their childs transition to foster care (i.e. special needs, strengths, talents, interests, favorite foods, medications etc.). Partnering with parents, guardians or legal custodians early in the life of the case and facilitating visitation within required time frames can serve to foster cooperation and lessen the anxiety experienced when a child is removed from their home.Tips to Minimize Trauma at Removal and Placement into Foster Care1:Plan ahead as much as possible to reduce the element of surprise. Keep the family informed of our involvement and that removal is a possibility.Engage the parent/child/other household members during the assessment and development of the genogram to identify supportive individuals and/or placement resources for their children, i.e. kin, friends, etc.Identify a placement before removal, if possible. If the child needs to wait at the DFCS office while a placement is located, find a comfortable place for them to wait away from your phone conversations with prospective placements (to avoid hearing rejections), and perhaps with something to do to entertain themselves.Collaborate with other agencies, when possible. Clarify roles and expectations to assist with the transition.Separate children from the chaos of arrest, interrogation, or resistance on the part of the parents.Engage the parents in helping the child. Remain calm. Move slowly. If the parent is visibly agitated, help to calm the parent down to reduce the effects on the child.Explain to the child what is happening. Give the child as much information as possible as to where they are going and where they will be placed. Assure them that this is not their fault. Assure them that they are safe and will be cared for. Assure them that their siblings, if separated, are safe and will be cared for and they will see their family soon. Dont make promises you cant keep.Provide sensory comfort, familiarity, help with settling in. Ask the parent, or the child, to gather together some familiar things before taking them away. Let the parent put child into the car seat, say good-bye, assist in the process of removal.Ask children if they are hungry or thirsty. Provide comfort food. Ask them what they would like.If the child must be picked up from school or other location to remove due to safety concerns, create a chance for the child to go home and pick up some things from home. Perhaps a kin or friend could meet them there or go with them to help pack some belongings.Ask the parent and the child about medical conditions, allergies, medications. Especially for babies and very young children, ask the parent for information about feeding, schedules, routines.Take time to help the child transition into the foster home. Make every effort not to use a provider to transport the child to their initial placement. The child may have connected to you during the removal. They have already had one abrupt separation. It may be reassuring to the child to know that the worker knows the people and place where they will be staying. Be a constant in the childs life until visits with parents can start.If the child is being placed with a foster parent, ask the foster parents to meet with the childs parents to exchange information about the child and the childs living situation.Inform the placement caregiver (foster parent, kin, etc.) about the child  medical conditions, allergies, medications, known behavioral and emotional issues, important people, anything that will help them to understand the child and to help them feel safe and comfortable.Empathize, connect, and try to understand the childs perspective.Be open to listening if they want to talk.Acknowledge the childs feelings and the difficulty of what they are going through.Acknowledge their love for their parents and their parents love for them.Keep the parents informed of how the child is doing, when they will see the child, what they can do to support the child and to reunite with the child.Support childs relationships and family connections:Place siblings together.Visitation is extremely important. In addition to their own trauma of being separated, children may worry about the safety and wellbeing of those family members from whom they are separated. Seeing that they are OK can ease that worry. If siblings are placed separately, arrange for sibling visits ASAP, and/or ask foster parents to allow and arrange for sibling contact. Set up visitation between child, siblings and parents as soon as possible.Notify the childs school so they can be supportive, if the child remains in the school, or to provide classmates the opportunity for closure or continued connection if the child is to attend a different school. Allow the child to resume attending school as soon as possible. School may have been the one place where they felt safe.Provide services aimed at healing and wellbeing as soon as possible, including trauma informed services:Make sure the child has someone to talk to about whats happening that they feel comfortable with.Refer the child and parents for assessments, counseling and/or other trauma informed therapy.Provide training, information and support to the foster parents to help them care for the child and to address the childs needs.Motor Vehicle Hot Car SafetyChildren are sensitive to heat as their body temperature can heat up three to five times faster than an adults. Children will die if their body temperature exceeds 107 degrees. Even at a temperature of 60 degrees outdoors, the temperature inside a car can exceed 110 degrees. At initial placement, caregivers should be reminded of motor vehicle safety as it pertains to hot cars, and steps they can take to avoid related serious injury or death. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) recommends the following precautions to take to avoid child heatstroke.Never leave a child unattended in a vehicle  even if the windows are partially open or the engine is running, and the air conditioning is on.Make a habit of looking in the vehicle  front and back  before locking the door and walking away.Ask the childcare provider to call if the child doesn't show up for care as expected.Do things that serve as a reminder that a child is in the vehicle, such as placing a phone, purse or briefcase in the back seat to ensure no child is accidentally left in the vehicle; or writing a note or using a stuffed animal placed in the driver's view to indicate a child is in the car seat.Always lock your vehicle when not in use and store keys out of a childs reach, so children cannot enter unattended. Teach children that a vehicle is not a play area.A child in distress due to heat should be removed from the vehicle as quickly as possible and rapidly cooled.Pictures of Children in Foster CarePictures are useful tools in child welfare cases. Pictures serve as evidence in child abuse cases. They can be utilized as a resource for identifying children in foster care who need to be transported by a service provider, have been abducted or have runaway. Pictures may also document ones childhood and play a vital role in the development of the childs Life Book while in foster care. Because of trauma that children in foster care have suffered, it is imperative that sensitivity is used when taking pictures of children. Parents, caregivers, and children, when age and developmentally appropriate, should be provided an explanation of the need for maintaining updated pictures in the case record. If a current picture meeting the criteria outlined in procedures is available and can be uploaded, an additional picture is not needed. However, if a current photo is not available, the SSCM should engage the parents and/or caregivers, when possible, in taking a picture of the child using the SSCMs state issued camera or mobile device. The picture should appear natural and not intrusive. Safe to SleepCaregivers of infants ages 0-12 months old must be informed of conditions that constitute a safe sleeping environment and that reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), also known as crib death (See DFCS Infant Safe Sleep Guidelines and Protocol for additional guidance). Prior to placing a child with a placement resource, the home environment should be assessed to ensure that safe sleep conditions exist. At minimum, caregivers must be advised of the three primary safe sleep recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) commonly referred to as the ABCs of safe sleep:Alone  The babys sleep area should be close to, but separate from, where caregivers and others sleep. The sleep area should be free of soft objects, toys, and loose bedding.Back  Infants should always be placed on their back to sleep for naps and at night.Crib  Place infants on a firm sleep surface, such as on a safety approved crib mattress, covered by a fitted sheet.Information outlined above should be discussed with the child and caregiver on the day placement occurs and encouraged during pre-placement visits. SiblingSibling is defined as a person with whom a child shares a biological mother or father or one or both parents in common by blood, adoption or marriage, even if the marriage was terminated by death or dissolution. Additionally, the relationship between a child and his/her siblings shall not be severed until the relationship is terminated by a final adoption order. FORMS AND TOOLSAgreement SupplementCreating and Using Life BooksCaregiver Child Safety Agreement Caregiver Child Safety Agreement (Spanish) Infant Safe to Sleep Guidelines and Protocol Permanency TimelinePermanency Timeline (Spanish)Room, Board and Watchful Oversight Pla",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-10-foster-care-section-101-placement-child

In addition, there are established safety, permanency and wellbeing outcomes for children  in foster care.  Both federal and  state law specifycompressed time frames for judicial reviews and decisions that are intended to move children quickly through the child welfare system to permanency. Georgias child welfare practice remains mindful of these factors when working with families to establish case plan outcomes, provide appropriate services, and make permanency decisions. As a result, it is anticipated that children will spend less time in foster care and will experience fewer placement disruptions. Notwithstanding, DFCS must work in tandem with the judicial system and with community partners to achieve safety, permanency and well-being for children in foster care. Children require a variety of services to promote their health, well-being and safety. Due to the trauma experienced by children who enter foster care, many of them will have one or more needs that require immediate attention and sometimes ongoing care and treatment. Foster care provides an opportunity to conduct a comprehensive trauma-informed assessment of each childs needs and respond to those needs through a combination of short and long-term interventions. Exposure to intensely traumatic events may require ongoing treatment after a child exits foster care. Consequently, case managers must be knowledgeable and resourceful in developing and utilizing resources to enable children to achieve the highest level of functioning possible to support successful permanency outcomes. ResponsibilitiesWhile their child is in foster care, parents/guardians/legal custodians have the responsibility to:Collaborate with DFCS in developing written case plans, including concurrent permanency plans to support timely permanency outcomes for their child.Partner with DFCS to mitigate safety threats which led to the removal of the child from the home;Actively participate in services aimed at making behavioral changes and improving family conditions that can support the child return home.Maintain contact with their children through regular, consistent visitation;Inform the DFCS Social Services Case Manager (SSCM) about significant changes, such as a change of address, telephone number, job, income, health or marriage circumstances, as well as changes in relationships, household composition (including unrelated adults), etc.;Actively participate in planning for their children at court hearings, periodic reviews and meetings with local DFCS staff, etc.; andPay child support on behalf of their children in care, including medical coverage (if available to the parent). DFCS has the responsibility to:Ensure the safety and wellbeing of each child in care;Treat parents/guardians/legal custodian, children and their caregivers with dignity and respect;Provide excellent customer service;Assist each parents/guardians/legal custodian in understanding the seriousness of foster care and the childs need for permanency within 12 months of entering care; Inform the parent that parental rights could be terminated should reunification not occur in an expeditious manner;Participate with the parents/guardians/legal custodian in developing written case plans designed to achieve permanency for their child;Provide services to parents/guardians/legal custodian to enhance diminished protective capacity that necessitated foster care;Arrange regular visits between the parents/guardians/legal custodian and their child;Preserve sibling connections with children in care when they are not placed together;Share information with the parents/guardians/legal custodian about the childs well- being and experiences during placement;Inform the parents/guardians/legal custodian of placement changes and any major illnesses of the child; Make every effort to contact the parent prior to the child undergoing surgery;Partner with families during action planning and through the development of problem- solving skills;Conduct diligent searches in partnership with the family to identify absent parents and kin to serve as caregivers or other supports to the family.Partner with parents/guardians/legal custodian in planning for the child by having regularly scheduled meetings;Partner with the community to support families;Reinforce progress and celebrate accomplishments with families;Recommend the child be returned to the parents/guardians/legal custodian when the circumstances which made foster care placement necessary have been ameliorated to the point where the child will be safe in the home; andEnter and update all case information in Georgia SHINES to assure effective tracking of all children in foster care.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-10-foster-care-section-100-introduction-foster-care

Discuss the following: Their financial responsibility for expenses incurred by the state in serving their child.Their responsibility for providing health care coverage (if available and/or reasonable in cost).Cooperating with DCSS to determine their obligation based on applicable child support law, including being subpoenaed to court if they fail to cooperate.Notify the Revenue Maximization (RevMax) Specialist (RMS) of an existing juvenile court order for support and upload the court order into External Documentation in Georgia SHINES. NOTE: DCSS agents must usually establish a new support order through Superior Court.Enter a newly named putative father in the Person Detail page in Georgia SHINES.Notify RevMax via a Notification of Change (NOC) in Georgia SHINES of a new putative father to refer to the DCSS. Notate in the comments section that a new non-custodial parent has been added to the person detail page (see Forms and Tools: SHINES Job Aid- Child Support Referral Process in Georgia SHINES). NOTE: DCSS will only consider one putative father at a time.Notify RevMax via a NOC in Georgia SHINES of the following information to exchange with DCSS: An updated Person Detail page for an alleged parent.Effective date of childs return home.Effective date of termination of parental rights or voluntary surrenders.Employment status of the parents and any changes.Funding eligibility status of child. The RMS will:Refer the parents to the DCSS via Georgia SHINES as part of the eligibility determination for medical assistance and IV-E, if there is no existing juvenile court order for support.Refer any new alleged parent to DCSS, once notified via NOC in Georgia SHINES.Review funding determination and enter the correct funding source in the Eligibility Summary Page in Georgia SHINES any time changes are reported.  The Social Services Supervisor (SSS) will:Review the case record in Georgia SHINES to ensure: Parents are referred to DCSS.Completion of the NOC in Georgia SHINES when a new putative father is identified or when changes to the parents or childs situation become known.Provide guidance to the SSCM, as needed. PRACTICE GUIDANCEChild Support CollectionsAll child support collected is processed through the DCSS computer system ($TARS) for accounting and distribution purposes. In IV-E cases, federal regulations require that a certain portion of child support payments be remitted to the federal government. When DFCS has custody, funds are forwarded to the county department for the child to be utilized for the childs care. Any remaining funds may be deposited in a restricted funds account for the child (see Field Fiscal Services Financial Part 2 Manual 2403 Financial Section II: Restricted Funds - Children regarding restricted funds). DCSS is dependent on the SSCM for sharing critical updates that may impact the collection and or distribution of any collected payments. For example, an active child support case involves an absent father on whom the court has terminated parental rights and the child has been adopted. Upon notification by the SSCM via Georgia SHINES interface that rights have been terminated and the child has been adopted, collection activities for current support from that parent will cease; however, DCSS may continue collection until any amount in arrears issatisfied. Federal Parent Locator ServicesFederal Parent Locator Services are beneficial to DFCS in locating absent parents and identifying extended family members of a child for whom DFCS is making placement and/or permanency plans. DCSS may share the following information with DFCS on a custodial parent, non-custodial parent or putative father:Persons name.Persons address.Social Security Number.Employers name.Employers address.Federal Employer Identification Number.Wages, income and benefits of employment, including healthcare coverage.Type, status, location and amount of any assets or debts owed by or to, any such individual.NOTE: When locating a relative for title IV-E/IV-B program purposes, DCSS may only share the first six listed above. PaternityIn conjunction with a case that has been referred for full DCSS services where paternity is an issue, DCSS will arrange and pay for DNA testing. However, if the putative father tested is the biological father, he will be required to pay for the testing. Any other need by the county department to establish paternity; e.g., in preparation for filing a Termination of Parental Rights (TPR) petition, identification of a placement resource, etc., will require DFCS to schedule and pay for the testing.The SSCM should notify the putative father of his responsibility to contact DCSS regarding paternity testing while simultaneously notifying RevMax of the need to refer the father to DCSS.Payment HistoriesDocumentation of the payment history of parents may be useful information in preparing for a review, building a case for TPR or documenting evidence for a court hearing.FORMS AND TOOLSChild Support Referral Process in Georgia SHINES  Job Aide",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-9-eligibility-section-912-child-support

A trial home visit should be less than six months unless extended by the court, in order not to adversely affect a childs IV-E eligibility/reimbursability. DFCS retains legal custody for the duration of a trial home visit. Although a IV-E eligible child retains medical assistance during a trial home visit, the child is not eligible to receive IV-E payments. Parents cannot be paid a per diem for caring for their own children. Parenting Youth in Foster CareThe Title IV-E program allows for states to claim reimbursement for the cost of an infant living in the same placement of the parenting youth in foster care without requiring DFCS to obtain custody of the infant (see policy 9.1 Eligibility: Foster Care Maintenance Payments). The added cost of care for the infant is reimbursed through the parenting youths IV-E status. Only one payment is made to the placement provider. State funds may be used if the child remains in the custody of a parenting youth in foster care who is not IV-E eligible. If the child of a parenting youth in foster care is ever removed and placed apart from his or her parent, judicial placement authority must be obtained by DFCS. The infant would be entered into Georgia SHINES as a foster child and a Medicaid Application and IV-E Application for Foster Care would have to be submitted to RevMax. If the issues requiring the removal fromthe parenting youth in foster care are addressed and the court sanctions reunification, the child may be placed in the same placement as the parenting youth and not lose IV-E eligibility or reimbursability.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-9-eligibility-section-910-special-situations-trial

Eligibility is determined on a one-time basis when the child initially enters care. It is based on the childs situation at the time of removal. Once established, a childs eligibility continues as long as the child remains in DFCS custody. Reimbursability refers to the federal share in paying for the maintenance costs of a child in care; i.e., charging the cost of care to IV-E Foster Care (IV-E FC). The state may also claim IV-E administrative costs when a child is IV-E reimbursable. A child may lose and regain reimbursability status depending on changes in:Placement.Financial need.Legal responsibility for the placement and care of the child.Judicial determination of reasonable efforts to finalize the childs permanency plan obtained within 12 months of the childs removal and at least every 12 months thereafter while the child is in care.Generally, IV-E reimbursability is for the entire month; therefore, if a child is IV-E reimbursable for any part of a month, the child is IV-E reimbursable for the entire month. The only exception to the whole month rule occurs with a change in the childs placement. A change in placement affects the reimbursability as of the date of change. Any time reimbursability is lost, the child is reclassified to IV-E non-reimbursable. Concurrent PaymentsA concurrent placement is defined as the planned, purposeful absence of a child from his original foster home/facility which continues to be paid at the same time his temporary placement is paid. This situation requires consideration of payment sources as two IV-E payments cannot be made at the same time. Non-IV-E Reimbursable PlacementsNon-IV-E reimbursable placements include the following:Regional youth detention centers (RYDC).Youth forestry camps (YFC) (secure and non-secure).Youth development centers (YDC) and other public or private facilities (secure and non- secure) that are operated primarily for the detention of delinquent children, which must be (a) physically restricting and (b) likely to be non-operational without a population of children adjudicated delinquent (i.e., hardware secure, locked facilities).Medical facilities.Relative homes that are not approved foster homes. If a child enters a reimbursable foster care placement for part of a month, but is subsequently moved to a non-reimbursable facility for part of the same month, the childs cost of care is not reimbursable beginning on the date of placement in the non-reimbursable placement. The child is not IV-E reimbursable until entering a reimbursable placement. Financial Need (Income and Resources)The child must have financial need in Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) terms for each month that he or she is in care. Only the childs income and resources are considered. In determining initial eligibility, the total income of the removal family, including the child, is considered. The income available to the child must be less than 185% of monthly foster care per diem expenses. The RMS determines whether the childs income meets the standard after applying certain deductions and disregards. The childs resources must not exceed $10,000 in any single month. If the child in foster care is working, it is important for the RMS to know if the child is a full-time student in order to determine how to count the childs income. Legal Responsibility for Placement and CareThe county department must continue to have a valid court order or VPA giving DFCS placement responsibility for the child.Fatal Flaws with IV-EThe following circumstances are fatal to IV-E eligibility; i.e., the child loses IV-E eligibility and reimbursability for the entire placement episode in foster care when:A judicial determination of contrary to the welfare or best interest is not obtained in the first order that sanctions the removal of the child.A judicial determination of reasonable efforts to prevent removal or reasonable efforts are not required is not obtained within 60 days of the childs removal via court order.The child reaches age 18.DFCS custody is terminated.DFCS fails to acquire a court order within 180 days of a VPA that contains the judicial finding that continued placement is in the best interest of the child.The child is on a trial home visit beyond six months or the trial home visit exceeds the time frame authorized by the court.The child is on runaway status beyond six months.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-9-eligibility-section-99-iv-e-reimbursability

If the reasonable efforts judicial determination is not included as required in the court orders, a transcript of the court proceedings is the only other documentation accepted to verify that the required determination has been made. Neither affidavits nor nunc pro tunc orders will be accepted as verification in support of reasonable efforts judicial determinations. NOTE: Court orders that reference State law to substantiate judicial determinations are not acceptable, even if the law provides that a removal must be based on a judicial determination that remaining in the home would be contrary to the welfare or that removal can only be ordered after reasonable efforts have been made.Obtain a judicial determination of reasonable efforts to prevent a childs removal from the home. When a child is removed from his/her home, the judicial determination, as to whether reasonable efforts were made or were not required to prevent the removal, is made no later than 60 days from the date the child is removed from the home;If the determination concerning reasonable efforts to prevent the removal is not made as specified above, the child is not eligible under the title IV-E foster care maintenance payments program for the duration of that stay in foster care.Obtain a reasonable efforts determination even during emergency removals. When child safety precludes efforts to prevent removal, the court must still make a judicial determination regarding reasonable efforts. After considering whether appropriate services were or should have been provided, the court may determine that it was reasonable for the agency to make no effort to provide services to prevent removal in light of exigent circumstances discovered through the assessment of the family, such as the safety or protection of the child.Present evidence to the court outlining the reasonable efforts made to prevent removal and to provide services to make it possible for the child to safely return home and why protective custody is in the best interests of the child.Obtain, when appropriate, a judicial determination from a court of competent jurisdiction that reasonable efforts are not required to prevent a childs removal from home or to reunify the child and family when the parent has: Subjected the child to aggravated circumstances (as defined in State law, which definition may include but need not be limited to abandonment, torture, chronic abuse and sexual abuse) (see Practice Guidance: Aggravated Circumstances);Been convicted of: Murder (which would have been an offense under section 1111(a) of title 18, United States Code, if the offense had occurred in the special maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the United States) or murder in the second degree of another child of the parent;Voluntary manslaughter (which would have been an offense under section 1112 (a) of title 18, United States Code, if the offense had occurred in the special maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the United States) of another child of the parent;Aiding or abetting, attempting, conspiring, or soliciting to commit such a murder or such a voluntary manslaughter; orA felony assault that results in serious bodily injury to the child or another child of the parent.Had their parental rights with respect to a sibling involuntarily terminated and the circumstances leading to such termination of parental rights to that sibling have not been resolved;When the parent or legal guardian has committed sexual abuse against the surviving child or another child of the parent; orWhen the parent or legal guardian is required to register with a sex offender registry under section 113 (a) of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006.Obtain, when appropriate, a judicial determination that the court made a presumption that it is reasonable to make no efforts to reunify the child and family when: The parent, guardian or legal custodian has unjustifiably failed to comply with a previous court-ordered plan designed to reunite the family; orThe child has been removed from the home on at least two previous occasions and reunification services were made available on those occasions; and/orAny of the grounds for terminating parental rights (TPR) exist (see policy 17.11 Legal: Termination of Parental Rights (TPR)). NOTE: A finding should be entered to the effect that reasonable efforts to reunify a child and family will be detrimental to the child and that reunification services; therefore, should not be provided or should be terminated if the court makes any of these presumptions.Obtain a judicial determination that it has made reasonable efforts to finalize the permanency plan that is in effect (whether the plan is reunification, adoption, legal guardianship, placement with a fit and willing relative or placement in another planned permanent living arrangement) within 12 months of the date the child is considered to have entered foster care and at least once every 12 months thereafter while the child is in foster care (see Practice Guidance: Date Child is Considered to Have Entered Foster Care in policy 17.1 Legal: The Juvenile Court Process). NOTE: Permanent placement with a fit and willing relative is not a permanent placement option in Georgia unless as part of another planned permanent living arrangement.Obtain judicial findings of reasonable efforts to finalize the permanency plan at each permanency plan hearing, but at least within 12 months of the date the child is considered to have entered foster care for Title IV-E purposes. Subsequent findings should be made no later than 12 months from the previous findings. If such a judicial determination regarding reasonable efforts to finalize a permanency plan is not made, the child becomes ineligible under Title IV-E from the end of the 12th month following the date of the childs removal or the end of the 12th month following the month in which the most recent judicial determination of reasonable efforts to finalize the permanency plan was made and remains ineligible until such a judicial determination is made;Reasonable efforts to finalize an alternate permanency plan may be made concurrently with reasonable efforts to reunify the child and family. Reasonable efforts to place a child for adoption or with a legal guardian, including identifying appropriate in-state/tribal Service area and out-of-state/Tribal service area placements, may be made concurrently with reasonable efforts to reunify the child and family;If continuation of reasonable efforts is determined to be inconsistent with the permanency plan for the child, reasonable efforts are made to place the child in a timely manner in accordance with the permanency plan including, if appropriate, through an interstate placement, and to complete whatever steps necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the child.Demonstrate the following at the respective hearings: The preliminary protective hearing: Reasonable efforts to prevent placement of the child in foster care;There are no appropriate services or efforts which would allow the child to remain safely in the home given the circumstances of the child and family at the time of removal, so the absence of efforts was justifiable;Reasonable efforts to prevent placement and to reunify the child are not required and why.The adjudication hearing:Reasonable efforts to eliminate the need for removal of the child from his/her home and to reunify the child with his/her family at the earliest possible time; orReasonable efforts to prevent placement and reunify the child are not required and why.All other hearings:Reasonable efforts to eliminate the need for removal of the child from his/her home and to reunify the child with his/her family at the earliest possible time;Reasonable efforts to finalize an alternate permanency plan for the child. NOTE: When DFCS has a concurrent plan, the court shall review reasonable efforts to achieve both plans.Ensure the court reviews the reasonable efforts to recruit, identify and make a placement with kin, foster parent or other person who has demonstrated an ongoing commitment to the child and has agreed to provide a permanent home for the child if reunification is not successful, when the case plan is concurrent. PROCEDURESThe Social Services Case Manager (SSCM) will:Make reasonable efforts to prevent removal, reunify the child and family and/or finalize the permanency plan (see Practice Guidance: Reasonable Efforts).Ensure that when a concurrent permanency plan has been ordered, reasonable efforts are made to finalize both the primary plan and the alternative plan (see policy 10.23 Foster Care: Case Planning).Document reasonable efforts in the case plan in Georgia SHINES and include: A description of the circumstances requiring the childs removal;How these circumstances prevent the childs safety;Services offered or provided to the family by DFCS;The familys response to services; andAll other efforts made to prevent removal.Provide documentation to the court detailing the services offered and provided to the family and the familys response.Review all court orders issued within the first 60 days following removal for findings of reasonable efforts to prevent removal or reasonable efforts were not required (see policy 17.3 Legal: Court Orders and Placement Authority). Determine whether any order issued within the first 60 days following removal includes findings of reasonable efforts to prevent removal or reasonable efforts were not required;Document the receipt of the court order on the Legal Action and Outcomes Detail page and upload all court orders in External Documentation in Georgia SHINES. NOTE: Nunc pro tunc orders must be carefully reviewed to ensure that only the judges signature and not the finding is dated back to actual hearing date..Complete the following for reasonable efforts to finalize the permanency plan:Ensure that a judicial finding of reasonable efforts to finalize the permanency plan occurs at any permanency plan hearing, but no later than 12 months of the childs removal and every 12 months thereafter (see policy 17.1 Legal: The Juvenile Court Process);Verify the court order contains the following:The specific permanency plan;Judicial finding of reasonable efforts to finalize the permanency plan;The child/case specific efforts to achieve the permanency plan.Document receipt of the court order in the Legal Action and Outcomes Detail page and upload all court orders into External Documentation in Georgia SHINES, if they are not uploaded by the Case Plan Reporting System (CPRS) in Georgia SHINES. NOTE: Nunc pro tunc orders must be carefully reviewed to ensure that only the judges signature and not the finding is dated back to actual hearing date.Notify the Revenue Maximization (Rev Max) Specialist via the Notification of Change (NOC) in Georgia SHINES when the received court order has been uploaded.  The Social Services Supervisor (SSS) will:Provide guidance to the SSCM on conducting and documenting reasonable efforts.Conduct a supervisory staffing with the SSCM to discuss: Timely service provision to prevent removal, reunify the child and family or achieve an alternative permanency plan, as appropriate depending on whether the case is in Child Protective Services or Foster Care;Whether reasonable efforts are being made;How to document reasonable efforts in the case record.Review documentation in Georgia SHINES to verify: Reasonable efforts are being made to prevent removal, reunify the child and family or achieve an alternative permanency plan;Timely and accurate completion of the Legal Status and Legal Action and Outcomes Detail pages;Court orders have been uploaded to External Documentation;The NOC is sent to Rev Max notifying them of uploaded court orders;Court orders have the required language and case specific reasonable efforts are outlined in the order.Assist the SSCM in contacting the SAAG when a court order does not meet the reasonable efforts language or case specific requirements. PRACTICE GUIDANCEReasonable Efforts to Prevent Removal and/or Safely Reunify the Child and Family DFCS is committed to making reasonable efforts to prevent a childs removal. Some examples of reasonable efforts include, but are not limited to:Use of family resources, neighbors or other individuals in the community as safety interventions.Use of community agencies or services as safety interventions.Having the alleged maltreater leave the home, voluntarily or in response to legal action.Having the non-maltreating parent, guardian or legal custodian move to a safe environment with the child.Having the parent, guardian or legal custodian place the child outside of the home. When making reasonable efforts, DFCS must consider the unique needs of each family to address the concerns identified. A determination by the court that DFCS made reasonable efforts in any individual case depends on whether DFCS offered and provided the services most likely to remedy a particular familys problem and/or actively facilitated safe reunification. When determining whether reasonable efforts have been made, the court shall consider whether services to the child and his or her family were:Relevant to the safety and protection of the child.Adequate to meet the needs of the child and family.Culturally and linguistically appropriate.Available and accessible.Consistent and timely.Realistic under the circumstances.When the court is determining whether reasonable efforts have been made to finalize an alternative permanent home for a child, the court shall also consider whether DFCS has completed the required diligent search and provided notice to persons identified during the diligent search. State law defines reasonable efforts as due diligence and the provision of appropriate services. The judicial determination of reasonable efforts should be explicitly documented in the court order and made on a case-by-case basis; e.g., based on the individual circumstances/facts of the case which led the judge to conclude this finding. NOTE: The order may enumerate the specific facts of the case or may reference the facts in such documents as the petition, court report, Case Plan, Comprehensive Child and Family Assessment (CCFA), etc. The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (PL 96-272) requires that support services be provided to families to strengthen their ability to provide for the safety and care of their children and prevent the unnecessary removal of the child. The judicial determination reasonable efforts to prevent removal is made whenever the court determines that DFCS was providing adequate services to preserve the family unit prior to the courts removal. It is recommended that the finding be obtained in the earliest possible order (i.e., the removal order or the order as a result of the preliminary protective hearing). If the finding is not made within 60 days of the childs removal, the child is not eligible for IV-E foster care maintenance payments for the duration of the childs stay (placement episode) in foster care. In emergency situations, the judge may find to the effect that it is reasonable to make no efforts to maintain the child in the home or reasonable efforts to prevent removal were not appropriate or in the best interest of the child. Once the child enters foster care, the court makes a judicial determination at each subsequent review to the effect that reasonable efforts are being made to safely reunify the child and family unless reasonable efforts were not required. For the court to make a reasonable efforts to reunify finding, the case plan for reunification (see policy 10.23 Foster Care: Case Planning) must provide a description of the specific actions and services required of the parent, guardian or legal custodian and agency in order for the child to be safely returned. The judicial findings at each stage of juvenile court proceedings clarify what services were offered and provided tothe parent, guardian or legal custodian and their outcome. Should termination of parental rights be pursued, the findings may be used as evidence. Reasonable Efforts Not RequiredSome circumstances do not require DFCS to reunify families. However, following submission of a case plan recommending that reunification services are not appropriate (non-reunification case plan), the court must make a judicial determination based on clear and convincing evidence. A hearing is held within 30 days of the filing of a non-reunification case plan (see policy 10.23 Foster Care: Case Planning). At the hearing, the court determines whether reunification services are not required by law or will be detrimental to the child and enters a finding to that effect. As with all hearings and reviews, the court is informed as to whether and when DFCS intends to proceed with TPR. The court also holds a permanency hearing to consider the proposed permanency plan and the steps to be taken to finalize the permanent placement of the child (see policy 17.1 Legal: The Juvenile Court Process). Once the court determines that reunification services are no longer required, the court requires that reasonable efforts be made to finalize an alternative permanency plan. Reasonable Efforts to Finalize the Permanency PlanThe finding is usually made at the permanency plan hearing which should be held:No later than 30 days after DFCS submits a non-reunification case plan to the court; orFor children under seven years of age at the time a petition for dependency is filed, no later than nine months after the children are considered to have entered foster care (see policy 17.1 Legal: The Juvenile Court Process);For children seven years of age and older, no later than 12 months after the children are considered to have entered foster care; EXCEPTION: For siblings removed at the same time and in which at least one child is under seven years of age at the time the dependency petition is filed, the permanency plan hearing shall be held no later than nine months after the children are considered to have entered foster care.Subsequently, every six months after the initial permanency plan hearing. NOTE: To ensure compliance with Title IV-E requirements, DFCS policy and practice requires a hearing must be held within 12 months of removal and subsequently, every 12 months thereafter, as long as the child remains in care (see policy 17.1 Legal: The Juvenile Court Process). The permanency plan in effect is the one in place (previously approved by the court) at the time of the hearing. The court order must specify the permanency plan. If the court finds that the child has been living in a stable home environment with the current caregiver(s) for the past 12 months and that removal from the caregiver(s) would be detrimental to the childs emotional well-being, the court may presume that continuation of the childs placement with the current caregiver is in the childs best interests and shall enter a finding that a change of placement is a failure by DFCS to make reasonable efforts to finalize the permanency plan in effect at the time of the hearing; provided, however, that such presumption shall not apply to prevent the return of the child to his or her parent, guardian, or legal custodian. If the reasonable efforts to finalize finding is not made, the child cannot be IV-E reimbursable from the end of the 12th month following removal or the end of the 12th month following the month in which the most recent judicial determination of reasonable efforts to finalize wasmade. When a judicial determination is made, IV-E payments can begin effective the first day of the month in which the finding was made. Aggravated CircumstancesThe parent, guardian or legal custodian has:Abandoned a child;Aided or abetted, attempted conspired or solicited to commit murder or voluntary manslaughter of another child of the parent;Subjected a child or his/her sibling to torture, chronic abuse, sexual abuse or sexual exploitation;Committed the murder or voluntary manslaughter of his/her childs other parent or has been convicted of aiding or abetting, attempting, conspiring or soliciting the murder or voluntary manslaughter of his/her childs other parent;Committed the murder or voluntary manslaughter of another child of the parent;Committed an assault that resulted in serious bodily injury to his or her child or another child of the parent; orCaused his child to be conceived as a result of having non-consensual sexual intercourse with the mother of his child or when the mother is less than ten years of age.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-9-eligibility-section-95-reasonable-efforts

Judicial oversight is intended to prevent state agencies from acting too quickly and removing children unnecessarily. The first court order language criterion to establish IV-E eligibility is the judicial determination that continuation in the home is contrary to the welfare of the child or that placement would be in the best interest of the child. The contrary to the welfare determination must be in the first ruling that sanctions the removal of the child from the home or any order for temporary alternatives to foster care (see Practice Guidance in policy 17.1 Legal: The Juvenile Court Process for information on temporary alternatives to foster care). If the contrary to the welfare determination is not made in the first court ruling pertaining to removal from the home, the child will not be eligible for Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments for the duration of that stay in foster care. The finding should be explicitly documented in the court order and based on individual circumstances/facts of the case that led the judge to conclude the finding. The order must enumerate the specific facts of the case or reference the facts contained in such documents as the complaint, court report, Affidavit of Efforts, etc. Types of RemovalWhen DFCS obtains custody, there must be a removal for a child to be IV-E eligible. The two types of removals are:Physical removal, which occurs when the agency has physically removed the child from their current living arrangement.Constructive removal, which is considered a paper removal. In a constructive removal, the state/tribal agency has obtained legal custody and supervision of the child, but did not physically remove the child from their parent, guardian or legal custodian as the child was living with an interim caregiver at the time of removal. A child is considered constructively removed on the date of the first judicial order removing custody from the appropriate specified relative or the date that the voluntary placement agreement is signed by all relevant parties.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-9-eligibility-section-94-removal-home

sources including IV-E Foster Care, IV-B Foster Care, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Medicaid and state funds. The funding determination is processed in Georgia SHINES. Whenever possible, it is advantageous for the state to maximize federal financial participation. This allows state funds to be conserved and used for other services to benefit families. Another funding source available to DFCS is child support. The parents of children in care are routinely referred to Division of Child Support Services (DCSS) and may be obligated by court order to contribute to their child's care and medical support. The Social Services Case Manager (SSCM) needs to be familiar with funding sources and their programmatic requirements:IV-E Foster Care: Title IV-E is a federal funding source which provides reimbursement for costs associated with the care and maintenance of children in placement and for administrative costs related to the states Foster Care Program (e.g., case management, staff training, etc.). Children classified as IV-E eligible must have some relation to the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program (see policy 9.6 Eligibility: Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) Relatedness Criteria) in addition to meeting other criteria. Title IV-E is unrelated to Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF).IV-B: Title IV-B is a federal child welfare block grant that provides funds to states for foster care expenses. A child who is eligible for IV-B has been determined ineligible for IV-E Foster Care. The IV-B grant is capped. Once these limited federal funds are spent, foster care expenses are paid primarily with state funds. Any youth who has been IV-E eligible, but reaches the age of 18 and receives Extended Youth Supportive Services (EYSS), the youth is re-classified to state funded beginning the first day of the month following the month of his or her 18th birthday.Supplemental Security Income (SSI): SSI is a federal payment program for disabled individuals administered by the Social Security Administration. Payments are made directly to the recipient from the federal government monthly. However, when a child is in DFCS custody, the county department becomes the payee for the childs SSI check. SSI payments follow the child; and therefore, are a benefit to children while in care as well as when they achieve permanency. While in care the SSI benefits help to offset the cost to care for the child. Federal policy allows for a child to be concurrently eligible for SSI and IV-E FC. Guidelines for Deciding IV-E vs. SSIFor a child receiving SSI, the RMS will determine if it is more advantageous for the child in foster care to continue receiving SSI benefits or have his or her costs paid from IV-E Foster Care (FC).Using the childs per diem payment as the basis for making the decision: Make the child IV-E reimbursable (charge per diem costs to IV-E foster care), if the monthly per diem payment is more than the amount of the SSI funds received by the child.Continue the SSI and classify the child as IV-E non-reimbursable, if the monthly per diem cost is less than the amount of SSI funds received by the child.Applying programmatic reasons for making the decision, continue the SSI if: The child is expected to be in out-of-home care a short period of time.The child is approaching emancipation because SSI benefits do not terminate at age 18 as do IV-E benefits.The child is in the adoption process. The childs receipt of IV-E FC per diem and its effective date must be reported by the SSCM to the SSA. Per regulation, the SSA treats IV-E per diem as income and reduces the childs SSI check dollar for dollar based on the IV-E per diem amount. In all likelihood, the childs SSI payment will be suspended. If the child continues to receive a reduced SSI check amount, these funds may be used for other items/needs of the child. It must not be applied to the childs IV-E per diem as IV-E costs have already been applied. If the child subsequently loses IV-E eligibility, the SSCM must notify SSA. The childs SSI may be restored since state funded payments are not counted as income. FORMS AND TOOLSSocial Security Administration (SSA)",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-9-eligibility-section-93-applying-initial-funding

Coordination between SSCMs and the RMS is critical to the funding determination and medical assistance coverage for children in out-of-home placement. If a child in DFCS custody is covered by health insurance other than Medicaid, the name of the insurance company, policy number, group number and name of insured are important in processing the application for medical assistance. At the time that a claim is filed, such coverage will be primary with Medicaid being the secondary insurance provider. Children who are in an out-of-home placement may be eligible for medical assistance coverage under several Classes of Assistance (COA). The RMS determines the COA and processes the medical assistance determination in Georgia Gateway. The COA aligns with the funding determination (see the Medicaid Manual Chapter 2100: Classes of Assistance for the eligibility requirements of each type of medical assistance). MedicaidThe Medicaid program is a joint federal/state program that is authorized under the Social Security Act. Funds are available to states for providing medical services to eligible recipients and for reimbursing activities that support the administration of the Medicaid program. DFCS accesses Medicaid funds through the Department of Community Health (DCH) and the Division of Medical Assistance (DMA) for case management and services for children in out- of-home care. Children who are IV-E eligible and/or SSI eligible are categorically eligible for Medicaid. Although most children in foster care are eligible for Medicaid, children whose fostercare is paid by state funds may not be eligible for Medicaid. Consequently, the medical assistance COA for which these children qualify must be determined. Each COA has resource limits and certain deductibles (see the Medicaid Manual Chapter 2100: Classes of Assistance for the eligibility requirements of each type of medical assistance). Supplemental Security Income (SSI):SSI is a federal payment program for disabled individuals administered by the Social Security Administration. If a child in DFCS custody receives SSI, the Social Security Administration processes the childs monthly Medicaid card. PeachCare for Kids®PeachCare for Kids® provides comprehensive health care for children who do not qualify for medical assistance and do not have any other form of insurance. The child must meet citizenship/alienage requirements. PeachCare for Kids® is available to children from birth through the last day of the month of a childs 19th birthday. PeachCare for Kids® will waive the monthly premium for children in DFCS custody. GAMMISGAMMIS consolidates all required functions for Medicaid, PeachCare for Kids® and the public employee health benefits into a single computer system. The state agency which has oversight of these functions is the Department of Community Health (DCH). When screening in GAMMIS, assistance from the appropriate Office of Financial Independence (OFI) supervisor or case manager will be required. Georgia Families 360ËOn March 03, 2014, DFCS transitioned from a standard fee-for-service Medicaid program to a statewide Medicaid Care Management Organization (CMO) through Amerigroup Georgia Managed Care Company. The transition impacted children in DFCS custody and children receiving AA as they became members of a new program called Georgia Families 360Ë which is separate from Georgia Families, the general Medicaid program administered by the Georgia Department of Community Health (DCH). Georgia Families 360Ë is designed to provide coordinated care across multiple services and focus on the physical, dental, and behavioral needs of member children. The program is designed to ensure each member has a medical and dental home, access to preventive care screenings, and timely assessments. It also seeks to ensure medical providers adhere to clinical practice guidelines and evidence-based medicine. Upon receipt of the Amerigroup GA Families 360° DFCS Referral Form notifying of a childs entry into foster care, Amerigroup will:Ensure the child is enrolled on their roster as a member.Access each childs Virtual Health Record (If available) to begin care coordination planning and developing each childs individualized care plan.Assign each child to a CCT.Assign each child a primary care physician (PCP) and primary care dentist (PCD).Contact the primary care provider assigned to the child to obtain the most recent information available and required historical data.Provide ID cards to members via a secure portal on the Amerigroup website.7. Coordinate medical assessments and development of an individualized care plan for each child.  Amerigroup Care Coordination Teams (CCT) and Care ManagersEach Georgia Families 360Ë member is assigned to a regional Care Coordination Team with a specified Care Manager. The CCT members are Masters level staff, the majority of whom hold a professional license to practice in their respective field. The CCT completes a Health Risk Screening (HRS) on youth in care to identify medical and/or behavioral needs. The CCT is responsible for coordinating the health components of the Comprehensive Child and Family Assessment (CCFA), including the initial physical assessment, dental screening, and trauma assessment. Care Managers are the primary partner for identifying and making referrals for needed services. They ensure each youth has an individualized care plan that addresses both physical and behavioral health needs. They work with community agencies to ensure appropriate services are provided. Amerigroup GA Families 360° DFCS Referral FormDFCS communicates with Amerigroup, RevMax, and DCH utilizing an electronic notification form (E-Form) entitled Amerigroup GA Families 360° DFCS Referral Form. It is the primary means for communicating information about a member in Amerigroup. The form must be completed and sent to Amerigroup, RevMax, and DCH within 24 hours of a youth entering foster care. It should be thoroughly completed to include demographic information, medical information, placement information, the identified CCFA provider and other referrals (e.g., Babies Cant Wait). The form is also used to report updates, such as placement changes, a youth exiting care, etc. If there is information not available at the time of the initial referral to Amerigroup, submit the form as an update as soon as the information is obtained. Accurate and timely communication with Amerigroup and RevMax is vital to the Medicaid eligibility determination and the assignment of an Amerigroup CCTs and service providers. Important decisions regarding the assignment of primary care providers and referrals are made based upon the information submitted on the form. FORMS AND TOOLSAmerigroup GA Families 360° DFCS Referral Form PeachCare for Kids",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-9-eligibility-section-92-applying-medical-services

The IV-E Foster Care Program authorized by the Social Security Act, provides funds to states for the following activities:Maintenance of children in foster care placements.Reimbursement of administrative and case management costs incurred while staff work with the child, the childs family and the care provider.Reimbursement for training agency staff and providers who work with the child or who administer the foster care program.Children classified as Title IV-E eligible must have some relationship to the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program in addition to meeting other criteria. Title IV-E is unrelated to Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF). In the Welfare Reform Act of 1996, Congress mandated that the state AFDC policy in effect on July 16,1996 be used for determining the AFDC relationship for IV-E eligibility purposes. Federal Financial Participation (FFP)FFP is the portion paid by the Federal government to states for their share of expenditures for providing medical assistance services, administering the medical assistance program and certain other human services programs. Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC)AFDC was a program administered and funded by federal and state governments to provide cash assistance to needy families. It was replaced by the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) grant in August 1996. Child Care InstitutionStates may claim title IV-E foster care maintenance payments for children placed in a CCI for up to two weeks (14 days). After 14 days, the CCI must meet the requirements for a QRTP to claim foster care maintenance payments, unless the CCI placement is one of the allowable categories under title IV-E. Title IV-E agencies may claim 14 days of title IV-E foster care maintenance payments each time an eligible child is placed in a CCI regardless of whether the child has had previous CCI placements during their current foster care episode.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-9-eligibility-section-91-foster-care-maintenance

While not all case closings are planned, all efforts should be made to ensure the family is fully engaged in the process leading up to closure. Consider the following when ending services with families:Family PreparationDiscussions about termination and case closure should begin at service initiation and continue throughout the life span of the case. Families should be knowledgeable regarding what requirements are needed for case closure and should be engaged regularly regarding the level of progress made in order to achieve goals necessary for case closure. When families are well on their way towards goal achievement, discussions regarding possible case closure timeframes should be held to begin preparation.Developing Support SystemsFamilies should be assisted in developing formal and informal systems that can support them during and after DFCS involvement. The support system should be identified with the involvement of the family. This support system or family team can assist in the transitioning of families after case closure. Families should be encouraged to utilize these systems during the life of the case as a way for them to practice for life after DFCS services.DisengagementWhen terminating DFCS involvement with families, it is important to begin the process of disengagement of the working relationship between the SSCM and family prior to closing the case. The family should be reminded of the ongoing progress being made in resolution of risk and safety factors and that this will lead to a reduced need for DFCS involvement. This can be a challenging process for both the SSCM and the family as the SSCM must separate from the family while continuing to support and encourage them. The goal of the SSCM is to increase the emphasis on the family taking on more responsibility for problem solving and follow up.Family ReactionsTermination can be met with ambivalent feelings, especially when the helping relationship with the family has been rewarding. Some typical reactions may include denial, regression, additional needs and flight. It is essential to validate the familys feelings regarding termination and provide positive feedback regarding their achievements as well as assisting them in recognizing their strengths and abilities.SSCM ReactionsWorkers may experience a sense of loss as a result of termination. Separating from someone with whom a meaningful relationship has been developed can be difficult. Workers may question the quality of their performance, may have feelings of guilt, etc.Being clear about ones own feelings regarding termination can prevent transference issues as one can get easily caught up in the familys reactions if they are attempting to prolong the relationship.Process EvaluationCase closure should be a joint decision-making process between the SSCM and the family. The SSCM should review with the family all critical elements of intervention, while empowering the family to express their opinions/feelings and provide constructive feedback. Obtaining feedback from the family regarding their experience can provide valuable information to the family and agency regarding performance as well as in establishing future relationships. The evaluation helps the family to assess and recognize their progress and encourages future self-assessment/evaluation. FORMS AND TOOLSNotification of Child Protection Services Family Preservation Services Case Closure Notification of Child Protection Services Family Preservation Services Case Closure - Spanish",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-8-family-preservation-services-section-85-case

Does the family have a lot of problems? Few supports? Lack of organizational skills? Is the family involved with multiple treatment providers competing for the familys attention? Is attention being focused on issues unrelated to present safety? Are these unrelated issues taken attention away from the presenting problems or issues vital to safety?Determine if new issues arose that need to be added to the family plan and must be addressed prior to case closure. Determine if the new issues be related to the existing treatment outcomes in lieu of creating a new outcome.Initiate and participate in FTMs as needed to address case plan outcome achievement or lack thereof.If the relapse/setback cannot be managed without court involvement, initiate court action as outlined in policy 17.1 Legal: The Juvenile Court Process to ensure child safety.Participate in mediation based on a written agreement sanctioned by a juvenile court, in consultation with the Special Assistant Attorney General (SAAG), when applicable (see policy 17.4 Legal: Mediation).PRACTICE GUIDANCE A case plan is a plan that is designed to ensure that a child receives protection, proper care and case management and may include services for a child, parents, guardian or legal custodian. A complete review of the investigation as well as all other DFCS history is fundamental to begin case planning. The case plan is a deliberate, reasonable and mutually agreed upon strategy to enhance caregiver protective capacities and eliminate present danger situations and/or impending danger safety threats. The plan must provide a clear understanding of the reason for DFCS involvement with the family (consensus around family issues), changes which would constitute successful intervention (FLOs and ILOs), and the method for facilitating change (action plans). The case plan must be developed collaboratively with the family and providers based on a thorough understanding of the strengths and needs unique to a family. Family Team Meetings (FTM) and Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT) meetings are effective ways to engage natural and formal supports to enhance case plan development. Case plans are unlikely to result in desired outcomes if the family is not invested in them; therefore, the family must be actively involved in the case planning process if change is to occur. The most critical aspect of case planning involves establishing a partnership with caregivers and obtaining consensus regarding the family and individual level outcomes. Although case plan outcomes should be established after gaining consensus with the family, there are situations where a consensus may not occur prior to the development of the case plan. The FLO describes what the family will be doing in everyday life to successfully resolve the safety problem. It is recommended that families manage no more than two FLOs per case plan to prevent the family being overwhelmed and help them to focus on the most pressing issues that may be impacting child safety and well-being. Establish the most important outcomes first. With each established FLO there must be correlating ILO. ILO(s) should be specifically related to addressing a caregivers underlying issues that create an unsafe home environment for the child(ren). These personal self-management issues may be related to:Anger or controlSubstance abuseSexual behaviorsEmotional stabilityCriminal behaviorEach FLO and ILO must have an associated action plan which is a personalized plan targeting the most high-risk situations. For example, DFCS involvement is related to inadequate supervision and education neglect, but upon further assessment, it is determined that the caregiver has a substance abuse issue. Two FLOs will be developed with the family, one around ensuring adequate supervision of the child(ren) and the other to ensure the education needs of the children are being met. Only one ILO will be developed around the caregiver addressing substance abuse which is their underlying issue contributing to the maltreatment. An action plan will be established for each FLO and ILO (see policy 19.14 Case Management: Action Planning). At subsequent case evaluations, assess whether additional safety outcomes can be incorporated into the case plan, as the initial outcomes are achieved. Outcomes that the family would like to address that are not related to safety are considered secondary level outcomes. Secondary level outcomes maybe discussed with the family and resources may be provided to assist the family with meeting these outcomes. However, secondary level outcomes should not hinder the achievement of outcomes that impact child safety. Secondary level outcomes may be noted on the case plan, however, there is no associated action plan. Case Planning Involving Domestic Violence (DV)/Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) or Sexual AbuseCase planning involving domestic violence (DV), intimate partner violence (IPV) and sexual abuse must be managed differently than those that do not contain these elements. The primary focus of these types of cases is ensuring the child is not re-harmed, rather than the familys challenges with everyday life tasks. Therefore, the first FLO will address how the family will prevent the child from being physically (DV/IPV cases) or sexually (sexual abuse cases) harmed. The familys plan may include tasks related to the non-offending parent ensuring that the perpetrator does not have contact until recommended by the treatment provider. Other family members or supports may have tasks on the plan to assist the non-offending caregiver in enforcing a no contact plan. An individual level outcome for the perpetrator around sexual offending or DV/IPV will be established; and if the assessment reveals the non-offending parent has failed to protect, an ILO will be developed for the non-offending parent addressing his/her personal hurdle to protecting the children. Although the primary focus in these types of cases is keeping children free from physical or sexual harm, a second family level outcome (FLO) can be established around managing the developmental stage of everyday life the family finds challenging. However, the perpetrator cannot participate in the second family level outcome until he/she has received treatment and demonstrated substantial progress on their ILO related to their self-control issues (sexual abuse/DV/IPV). It is important to remember that service provision will be key in helping the family move forward with ensuring safety in the home as well as assessing behavioral changes that impact safety. SSCMs must work in partnership with community-based service providers to:Identify treatment approaches for the perpetrator of child abuse and neglect that have demonstrated effectiveness in regards to future abusive or neglectful behavior.Identify treatment approaches for the child victim that have been proven effective in reducing the impact of abuse and neglect on the child and assist in the childs resiliency. And3. Identify treatment approaches that will assist the non-offending caregiver in creating and maintaining positive outcomes that impact the family and the child(ren) in the home. Assessment of Childrens NeedsThe assessment of childrens needs is a part of case planning. The needs of children can be assessed through observation and a formal evaluation conducted by a provider. The SSCM must consider the following components as part of an ongoing assessment of child functioning, when applicable:Child development;Medical;Vision;Dental;Hearing;Mental health;Observations;Education;Substance abuse;Sexuality;Legal;Cultural connections;History of running away;Suspicion or known exposure sexual exploitation (CSEC);The youths voice (opinion, wishes, expectations, goals, viewpoints, etc.); andSocial/Other needs Documenting and Celebrating Case Plan ProgressDocumenting and celebrating is vital in solution based casework and case plan evaluation. Case managers should document and celebrate progress and completion with specific tasks of each action plan throughout the life of the case. Action plans include how each tasks will be measured allowing the case manager to review documentation of behavioral change and provide opportunities to acknowledge changes and celebration of achievement with the family. The case manager may also include suggestions for celebrating specific task completion while completing the action plan. In order to begin celebrating with families the SSCM must remember to notice and document what the behavioral change. The following examples can be used to recognize and celebrate change:Case managers can anticipate change by helping the family search for and recognize the new story that is emerging about them.Case managers can verbally acknowledge the progress the family is making in working their action plans which can help the family to feel encouraged and supported by the case manager.Case managers can use T-charts to compare the old unsafe and unproductive behaviors with safe and productive new ones, which help to capture and reinforce change.Scheduling a family team meeting that will focus on the significant and meaningful changes the family has made can be vital in reinforcing change and celebrating the family.Case managers can take the time to have a celebration party planned with the family and treatment providers to highlight their progress. You may include food, balloons and certificates to celebrate the families achievements.Case managers may write and mail the family a card detailing their progress and acknowledging their efforts and commitment to reaching their outcomes.While these are only a few examples, case managers can be creative with their families in the celebrating process by discussing different ways the family would like to celebrate as well. Managing SetbacksSetbacks are defined as the reoccurrence of a problem behavior that is considered high risk. Setbacks are a normal occurrence and can be managed while continuing case progression. A case manager and supervisors ability to thoroughly assess a familys setback and normalize them within the context of action plan, can assist in their ability to help move the family forward and assist them in utilizing newly learned skills. Preparing ahead of time for setbacks can help case managers respond appropriately to them. Some possible setbacks may include:Maintaining cleanliness of the home;Ongoing attendance at school;Personal hygiene for children;Consistently attending needed medical appointments;Missed appointments with service providers or;A new report alleging abuse or neglect. To assess and manage setbacks, the SSCM must first assess how the setback affects safety in the home and determine whether the current safety plan is sufficient to ensure safety or if a new one needed. It is important for the SSCM to gather information surrounding the setback and discuss information with their supervisor to determine next steps. Setbacks can evoke emotions for both the family and the SSCM, therefore the SSCM should be diligent in controlling their feelings around the setback to help the family move forward. FORMS AND TOOLSIntimate Partner Violence (Domestic Violence) Guidelines & Protocol",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-8-family-preservation-services-section-83-case

For example, a caregiver may choose to punish his/her child by spanking the child using an instrument such as a belt. Once this choice is made the caregivers intent is not relevant as to whether the child was maltreated. The natural consequences of the actions or inactions of the caregiver determine whether maltreatment occurred. The caregiver may not have meant to leave the marks, but because he/she made the decision to use the belt when hitting the child, marks occurred. The marks were left as a natural consequence of using the belt to spank the child. When maltreatment meets the statutory language in the definition, intent is not relevant; maltreatment occurred, and the allegation of abuse must be substantiated. However, the intent of the caregiver may be considered when making a safety determination. Resolving Discrepancies or Conflicting InformationDuring an Investigation, often there are discrepancies in information collected or there are conflicting accounts regarding the allegations of abuse. It is important to attempt to resolve discrepancies or conflicts to ensure that the information gathered accurately supports the investigation determination. Some ways to address these situations include but are not limited to:Reviewing the information gathered again to determine what information is needed to resolve the issue(s).Seeking supervisory assistance to review the information or develop a plan to resolve the issue(s).Conducting additional interviews with the family members, reporter, collaterals, etc.Engaging subject matter experts to assist in the review of evidence or to discuss the information.Requesting additional professional assessments or evaluations for the child(ren) or caregiver(s). Maltreatment DeterminationThe maltreatment determination considers whether the alleged child abuse is substantiated or unsubstantiated.Substantiated means the allegations of child abuse, as defined by Georgia statute, is supported by a preponderance of the evidence. A preponderance of evidence means that the greater the weight of the evidence makes it more probable than not that child abuse occurred. A substantiation determination also means harm to the child is severe enough to constitute maltreatment and there is sufficient evidence to support child maltreatment. When evidence supports maltreatment occurred, regardless of whether the identity of the maltreater is known or unknown the case determination must be substantiated.Unsubstantiated means the allegations of child abuse, as defined by Georgia statute, is not supported by a preponderance of the evidence. An unsubstantiated determination means harm to the child is not severe enough to constitute maltreatment and/or there is not sufficient evidence to support child maltreatment. Even though a maltreatment determination may be unsubstantiated, documentation may show a pattern of behavior that may be useful in decision-making. Safety DeterminationThe safety determination identifies the child as either safe or unsafe based on the safety assessment as outlined in policy 19.11 Case Management: Safety Assessment. The existence of maltreatment (substantiated or unsubstantiated) and a safety determination (safe or unsafe) are two separate determinations. A child may have been maltreated but could still be considered safe based on individual family circumstances and caregiver protective capacities. When a case involves a child death, a case determination must take into consideration whether they are other children in the home, and whether the other children in the home are safe. If there is a determination that any child in the home is unsafe then DFCS must transfer the case to Family Preservation Services or Permanency for further intervention. Making an Investigative Decision - Maltreater Unidentified or UnknownQuestions about the identity of a maltreater occur primarily when a child is injured, he/she is unable to identify the maltreater and there is more than one caregiver that could have caused the injury. In these circumstances, case managers and supervisors will need to reach a judgement as to whether there is a preponderance of the evidence that one of the possible caregivers, as compared to other caregivers, injured the child. A preponderance of evidence means that the greater the weight of the evidence makes it more probable than not that the caregiver caused the injury to the child. Reaching such a conclusion may require an investigation which is more time consuming and detailed than an investigation in which this issue is not present. There may be instances where the decision is made to substantiate child abuse against more than one caregiver, especially when the injuries have occurred over time. When the alleged maltreater is unknown and the evidence gathered during the investigation supports that child abuse occurred, the maltreatment determination must be substantiated.Investigation Conclusion PageThe Investigation Conclusion Page in Georgia SHINES is where the overall finding case disposition is recorded. Included on the Investigation Conclusion page is the Investigation Conclusion Summary. The purpose of this summarized what occurred during the investigation from beginning to end. This does not mean that the Log of Contacts should be copied and pasted into this section. An Investigation Conclusion Summary should include:What was alleged.Evidence to support or refute the allegations. Evidence may include pictures, direct witness statements, observations, formal diagnosis, evaluations from licensed clinicians, disclosures by the alleged victim child or other children subject to the care of the alleged maltreater, interviews with the alleged maltreater, history that shows a pattern of behavior, or information obtained by collateral resources.Family Functioning information relevant to the case determination.Safety related information and interventions put in place during the Investigation.The overall case determination including whether the case will be closed, or stage progressed to Family Preservation Services or Foster Care. Example of Substantiated-Open Investigation ConclusionOn 3/1/2017 a report was received indicating that the Lannister family moved from Florida to Georgia in December 2016. At the time of the move the family had an open CPS case in FL and failed to notify their case manager of the move to Georgia. The case was open due to medical neglect resulting from prescription substance abuse by the mother, Ms. Jane Lannister and her live-in paramour, John Baratheon. Ms. Lannister and Mr. Baratheon have one child, Joffery, age 2. Joffery was born premature and has not been seen in the doctors office since he was 9 months old. Jofferys pediatrician in FL indicated that Ms. Lannister missed several follow up appointments to treat a severe asthma condition. Ms. Lannister stated that she took Joffery to the doctor before leaving FL and was up to date on all well-checks and immunizations, however medical records verified this was untrue. Ms. Lannister also stated that she applied for Medicaid upon arriving in GA, however the application could not be located by Office of Family Independence (OFI). The sole income in the home is Mr. Baratheons SSI, received for a chronic seizure condition that is currently untreated. Both caregivers admitted to spending the SSI money on purchasing illegal prescription medications. The home was observed to be in disarray. Dirty dishes were piled up in the sink and all over the counter and food that appeared to be several days old was left on the table in dishes. Joffery was wandering around the home in a dirty diaper that had not been recently changed based on the amount of urine that saturated the diaper. He was also observed to be coughing and wheezing by the SSCM during the visit. The drug screen results on both caregivers were positive for opiates and benzodiazepines. SSCM also noted that Ms. Lannister and Mr. Baratheon appeared to be under the influence of substances as evidenced by sleeping during the day, slurred words when talking, and dilated pupils. Prior medical conditions were cited as the basis for the prescription drug use, however neither caregiver could produce valid prescriptions from a medical provider. Results of a substance abuse assessment included several recommendations for follow up treatment for both caregivers.Impending dangers were identified based on the caregivers inability to control their behavior and complete daily life activities (cleaning, taking child to the doctor, etc.) due to the illegal use of prescription drugs and the inability of both caregivers to give a valid explanation as to why Joffery had not been taken to the doctor to deal with his severe asthma in both FL and GA. A safety plan was completed to address the condition of the home, follow up on Jofferys medical care for observed respiratory issues, and to develop a plan for supervision of Joffery if Ms. Lannister or Mr. Baratheon are using prescription medications (legally or illegally) that affect their judgement and/or rendered them unable to care for the children. The home was cleaned on a follow up visit and Joffery was enrolled in daycare. An appointment was also made with a local pediatrician. Both caregivers indicate a willingness to attend substance abuse treatment based on the recommendations of the substance abuse assessments. Neglect (Medical Neglect) is substantiated due to Ms. Lannister failing to provide adequate medical care for Jofferys continued respiratory issues and the case opened for FPS. Recommended initial services are:Ms. Lannister and Mr. Baratheon need to follow up on recommendations from the substance abuse assessment.Follow up medical care for Joffery Example of Unsubstantiated-Closed Investigation ConclusionOn 3/2/17 DFCS received a report concerning Arya Stark stating that Arya was being abused by her father, Ned Stark. Arya was interviewed and stated that her father, Mr. Stark slammed her head into the head rest in the car. She also stated that Mr. Stark emotionally abuses her by calling her names. Collateral contacts and interviews with Aryas siblings did not support Aryas statement of abuse. Arya did not have any marks/bruises and Aryas siblings (Sansa, Robb, and Bran) stated that Arya is not physically disciplined. Arya also could not remember important details of her account such as when the alleged incident happened or why Mr. Stark allegedly did it. Arya has been seeing a therapist for approximately one year. The therapist reported that Arya never disclosed any abuse/neglect during the sessions. Arya did sustain an injury when Mr. Stark restrained her from running way, which was a minor bruise to the lip approximately a year and a half ago. Mr. Stark obtained therapy for Arya soon after the incident. Mr. Stark is a single parent, after losing his wife to cancer. The therapist indicated that there have been incidents of the family using name calling when they are angry, but she is doing both individual and family counseling with them to help work through these issues and feels that most of the problems are related to the familys grief. Mr. Stark has extended family support who assist him with the children. Other personal collateral contacts did not reveal any information that would indicate Mr. Stark was being abusive to his children. No impending dangers were noted. Allegations of physical abuse (bruises, welts, abrasions) are unsubstantiated. There is no CPS history, and no further services are recommended. Allegation Detail Page and the Justification of FindingsThe Allegation Detail page in Georgia SHINES is where the SSCM documents a disposition (substantiated or unsubstantiated) for each allegation of child abuse investigated. The  justification of findings supports the decision to substantiate or unsubstantiate the allegations. It is a clear and concise description of facts and evidence gathered during the investigation and details a preponderance of credible evidence to support the findings concerning one of the forms of child abuse investigated (prenatal abuse, risk of imminent harm, labor servitude emotional abuse, neglect, physical abuse, sexual abuse, and sexual exploitation). Below is an example of a justification of findings for neglect.Ms. Jones is substantiated for neglect due to abandonment. For six months from approximately August 8, 2021, through February 14, 2022, Ms. Smith abandoned her two children, S.D. and M.D., age 13, by leaving them with their grandmother Ms. Scott, without provision for their support and without regularly visiting them.Ms. Jackson is substantiated for neglect due to inadequate supervision. On January 11, 2022, Ms. Jackson neglected I.J., age 8 by failing to provide him with adequate supervision by leaving him alone at home while she was away from home at work for nine hours. Policy ViolationsPolicy Violations are actions performed by a DFCS agent that may breach any DFCS policy and/or RBWO Minimum Standards, but do not constitute child abuse. For additional information on policy violations see policy 14.22 Resource Development: Policy Violations. When a policy violation is supported or identified it should be discussed during the 48-hour staffing. The resource maintainer (Permanency SSCM, RD SSCM or OPM) has the responsibility to address the policy violation with the caregiver including implementing a CAP (if applicable) or initiating a policy violation assessment as outlined in policy 14.22 Resource Development: Policy Violations. FORMS AND TOOLSMaltreatment Codes",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-6-special-investigations-section-68-making-special

Was the mother planning to breastfeed or was breastfeeding at the time of death;How often did the caregiver check on the infant? At what time did the caregiver last check on the infant and how long following that period was the infant found unresponsive.Who found the child and what was the childs position when they were found unresponsive (e.g. on the back, stomach, under a blanket, etc.); andWho provided care for the children within the previous three days (daycare, grandparents, etc.).Gather information about the infants health, including but not limited to:Was the child full term and of a normal birth weight;Was the infant diagnosed with any medical conditions such as colic or reflux;Any recent illness such as a cold or fever; andWere immunizations up to date (if applicable).Gather information about the caregiver and other household members, including but not limited to:The caregivers emotional, behavioral, and/or cognitive protective capacities based on interviews and observations;The caregiver(s) condition at the time of the childs death, e.g. was the caregiver under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of the childs death (prescription or non-prescription); andDo the household members smoke tobacco in the home or are there other possible contributing factors (see Forms and Tools: Infant Safe to Sleep Guidelines and Protocol in Forms and Tools).Determine the level of understanding the caregiver(s) has of safe sleep environments:Has DFCS staff previously discussed and addressed the dangers of unsafe sleeping environments with the caregiver(s);Has the caregiver(s) received education from the birthing hospital about safe sleeping environments and the dangers to the infant; andHas the caregiver(s) received information from other sources (e.g. hospital, lactation specialists, and pediatrician) who recommended co-sleeping or sleeping practices for purposes of breastfeeding, bonding, soothing, historical sleeping practices, etc. If so, who and what were the specific recommendations.Observe the sleep environment of the infant and document the following: Where the child was located when found deceased (e.g. swing, bassinet, adult bed, etc.);Any pillows, soft bedding, blankets, or any other objects that were found near or on the infant at the time of death;How was the infant clothed or swaddled;If co-sleeping was involved; andThe condition and temperature of the home and the room where the child was found deceased.Take pictures of the sleep environment;Engage collateral contacts including individuals who can provide relevant information on the education the caregiver(s) has received regarding safe sleeping arrangements and verify recommendations made to the caregiver by other agencies or professionals (see policy 19.16 Case Management: Collateral Contacts).Request copies of any reports, interviews, photos, or video evidence that was obtained by law enforcement independent of DFCS.Review and analyze DFCS history (see policy 19.10 Case Management: Analyzing DFCS History). Does the documentation support that DFCS provided education and addressed safe sleeping environments with the caregiver(s) including whether the caregiver(s) agreed to utilize safe sleep practices;Is there a pattern of behavior showing that the caregiver allowed the infant to remain in an unsafe sleeping environment, or continued unsafe sleep practices after receiving education by DFCS; andWas a safety plan implemented addressing unsafe sleep practices in the current DFCS case, and whether the caregiver(s) adhered to the safety plan.During the supervisory staffing to make a special investigation determination, establish if the evidence supports that DFCS staff provided education and addressed safe sleep environments with the caregiver(s) (see policy 6.8 Special Investigation: Making a Special Investigation Determination).Substantiate neglect when evidence confirms that an unsafe sleep practice was the cause or contributing factor to an infant (under the age of one) death and documentation supports that DFCS staff previously educated the caregiver(s) of the dangers of an unsafe sleep environment to child safety. PRACTICE GUIDANCESerious InjurySerious Injury means bodily injury that involves substantial risk of death, extreme physical pain, prolonged and obvious disfigurement, or prolonged loss or impairment of the function of a body part, organ, or mental capability. Examples include burns, head trauma, blunt trauma, internal bleeding, multiple bruising and contusions, lacerations of organs, broken bones, and amputation Near FatalityNear fatality means as an act that, as certified by a physician, places the child in serious or critical condition. Once the child meets this criterion then the allegation of near fatality should be marked along with any other type(s) of maltreatment. How to determine a near fatality:Hospital records reflect that the childs condition is serious or critical.Ask the treating physician is the childs condition serious or critical. The Nature of Child Fatality CasesAwareness of some basic dynamics and issues is critical to effective investigations of child fatalities. Research has shown that children are most at risk of dying of maltreatment during the first 4 years of life. In fact, 40 percent of children who are victims of fatal maltreatment are infants (younger than 1-year-old) and 75 percent are younger than 5 years old. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that the chances of being murdered are greater on the day of birth than at any other point in a persons life. Caring for children during their preschool years can be very stressful for parents and other caretakers. Faced with a young childs persistent problems with sleeping, feeding, and/or toilet training a caretaker may lose control and assault the child in anger or may cause injury while punishing the child. Some inexperienced caretakers have unrealistic expectations about what is appropriate child behavior and what children can do in the early stages of development. Some caretakers become angry because they view a childs crying or bedwetting as an act of defiance rather than as normal behavior for a young child. The deadly combination of an angry adult and a physically vulnerable child can result in fatal or life-threatening injuries. When discussing child deaths related to maltreatment, the majority of child fatalities can be categorized as a variation of either acute or chronic maltreatment:Acute Maltreatment - the childs death is directly related to injuries suffered as a result of a specific incident of abuse. Often in such cases, the child has not been previously abused. In cases involving acute physical abuse, the caretaker may have fatally assaulted the child in either an inappropriate response to the childs behavior or a conscious act to hurt the child. Offenders in cases of Shaken Baby Syndrome (SBS), in which a childs brain is injured from violent shaking, often cite the childs crying as the triggering event.In cases of acute neglect, a caretakers one-time failure to properly supervise the child may result in a fatal injury. A common example is a fatal drowning that occurs when a parent leaves an infant briefly unsupervised in a bathtub or when children sustain fatal gunshot wounds when caretakers fail to properly secure loaded firearms.Chronic Maltreatment - in chronic maltreatment cases, the childs death is directly related to injuries caused by abuse occurring over an extended period. Battered Child Syndrome is an example of chronic physical abuse. Although the direct cause of death in a battering case is usually a single specific injury (often brain trauma), numerous indications of previous maltreatmentold and new injuries and possible signs of neglectare usually present. Depriving a child of food for a significant period of time is a common form of chronic neglect. In cases of chronic abuse, a history of the childs previous maltreatment often will appear in either CPS or medical records. Child Deaths and Joint Investigations with Law Enforcement and DFCS2Law enforcement is the criminal investigative agency in the community and often must investigate the same incident as DFCS. Conducting a parallel investigation where CPS and law enforcement collaborate and work as a team allows both law enforcement and CPS to avoid potential conflict and to improve investigative outcomes.3 These joint investigations should be conducted as outlined by the local Child Abuse Protocol and may include:Developing a plan to complete the investigation.Responding with law enforcement.Frequent and open communication to discuss the status of the case.Obtaining and sharing information in a timely manner, particularly at the following critical communication points: Completion of interviewsFiling a dependency petitionPrior to the return of the child victim to the home at any time during the life of a casePrior to the return of an alleged maltreater to the home at any time during the life of a caseReassessment of safety including changes to the safety plan or changes in placementDisclosure of information about criminal conductRefraining or delaying an interview with the alleged maltreater due to a criminal case. DFCS role is different from law enforcement. The role of DFCS is to determine whether maltreatment was involved in the childs death or serious injury, identify the responsible party, and then take appropriate action to protect any surviving siblings. The role of the law enforcement is to determine whether a crime has been committed and who is responsible. To be successful, law enforcement and DFCS need to coordinate their efforts and use their respective resources and skills collaboratively. Thus, it is imperative that law enforcement assumes the leadership role in the investigation. This is necessary because of the legal and practical issues involved in obtaining evidence and confessions. Only a law enforcement investigator has the training, expertise, and legal mandate to execute search warrants, collect and evaluate evidence, interrogate suspects, and file criminal charges. If a SSCM prematurely confronts an individual suspected of fatally abusing a child, law enforcement may find it more difficult, if not impossible, to successfully interrogate that same individual later. Requests by Law Enforcement to Refrain or Delay Interviewing Alleged Maltreaters Law enforcement may request DFCS refrain or delay interviewing the alleged maltreater due to a criminal case. The SSCM still has a primary obligation to ensure child safety. In this situation open and clear communication with law enforcement is necessary so that each agency understands what is required. When the alleged maltreater has access to the alleged victim child(ren) and a safety determination cannot be made without conducting an interview, communicate directly with law enforcement to coordinate the interview or to obtain a transcript of the interview conducted by law enforcement. When it is determined that the SSCM will not be conducting a separate interview with the alleged maltreater, a list of questions or information that is needed from the individual(s) can be provided to law enforcement to ask the during the interview.Childrens Advocacy Centers (CAC)4Child advocacy centers (CACs) are community-based, child-friendly, multidisciplinary services for children and families affected by sexual abuse or severe physical abuse. CACs bring together, often in one location, child protective services investigators, law enforcement, prosecutors, and medical and mental health professionals to provide a coordinated, comprehensive response to victims and their caregivers. This is called the MDT response and is a core part of the work of CACs. CACs offer therapy and medical exams, plus courtroom preparation, victim advocacy, case management, and other services. Forensic Interviews5The forensic interview is generally conducted at the local CAC by a professional specially trained in conducting forensic interviews with children. In addition to yielding the information needed to make a determination about whether abuse has occurred, this approach produces evidence that will stand up in court if the investigation leads to criminal prosecution. Properly conducted forensic interviews are legally sound in part because they ensure the interviewers objectivity, employ non-leading techniques, and emphasize careful documentation of the interview. Childrens Advocacy Centers (CAC) Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT)6Multidisciplinary teams represent a variety of disciplines that interact and coordinate their efforts to diagnose, treat, and plan for children and families receiving child welfare services. They may also be referred to as a ""child protection team,"" ""interdisciplinary team,"" or ""case consultation team. Due to the complex nature of child abuse investigations and family assessments, MDTs are often used to enhance and improve investigations and responses for children and families. Childrens Healthcare of Atlanta - Stephanie V. Blank Center for Safe and Healthy ChildrenStephanie V. Blank Center for Safe and Healthy Children provides forensic medical evaluations and interviews, behavioral health assessments and counseling, multidisciplinary team review and case tracking and research. In addition to clinical services, the Stephanie V. Blank Center for Safe and Healthy Children offers ongoing training, education, and consultation as well as collaborative partnerships within the community. Some of services the Center for Safe and Healthy Children provide, include:Personalized, age-appropriate exam education and preparationA comprehensive medical history and examination by a forensic physician or nurse practitionerColposcopy exams using video camera equipment for detailed, high quality photographic documentationRecorded forensic interviewsSecond-opinion consultationsExpert witness testimonyFor more information or to schedule an appointment please call Scottish Rite (404-785-3820) or Hughes Spalding (404-785-9930). Child Abuse Investigative Support Center7The Georgia Bureau of Investigations (GBI) Child Abuse Investigative Support Center assists law enforcement, child protective services, and district attorneys with the investigation of physical and sexual abuse of children. The Child Abuse Investigative Support Center provides forensic medical consultations in which the childs injuries are evaluated and medical records and the social/home environment are reviewed. An expert opinion is rendered and a letter detailing the accidental or inflicted nature of the injuries is provided. Expert testimony regarding the opinion is also available as needed. Services from the support center can be obtained by contacting:Child Abuse Investigative Support Center GBI Headquarters3121 Panthersville RoadDecatur, Georgia 30034404-270-8194FAX 404-270-8183 Autopsy ReportsAn autopsy determines the cause, manner, and underlying mechanism of death. This procedure also documents all the significant pathologic conditions present in the body at the time of death. Child Fatality Review Committees (CFRC)Each county shall participate as a member of the local multi-disciplinary CFRC that will review all deaths of children ages birth through age 17 years. County Departments must designate a representative to serve on the local CFRC based on the Countys Child Abuse Protocol and CFRC requirements. The SSCM may be contacted by the local county DFCS representative of the CFRC and/or asked to participate in the meetings. During the CFRC meetings, the SSCM/DFCS Designee may request an official copy of the death certificate or autopsy findings to include in the case record even after DFCS investigation has been completed.

Upon assignment of special investigation, the DFCS Investigator should communicate with and conduct a joint investigation with the oversight authority, when applicable. In addition, it may also be necessary to coordinate with law enforcement. Working collaboratively provides DFCS a liaison to assist in facilitating interviews, obtaining reports, videos, history, etc. The cooperation between agencies and disciplines also allows for different perspectives when gathering facts, as often the caregiver will tell different agencies different information. Sharing information obtained by each agency provides an opportunity to conduct a fully informed assessment of the incident and how to address any safety issues that are identified in partnership with stakeholders. When the investigation involves a child with an active child welfare case, the DFCS Investigator should work collaboratively with the SSCM with primary case management responsibilities, who has direct knowledge about the child and family. The DFCS Investigator should consult with the SSCM to obtain insight into child functioning and care of the child at the facility to assist with making a safety and maltreatment determination. During large facility investigations, it will be necessary to engage other DFCS staff to assist in conducting interviews of multiple alleged victims, facility staff members, witnesses, reviewing documents, tapes etc. In this instance, the DFCS Investigator should:Facilitate an initial meeting to determine roles, responsibilities, investigative activities, benchmarks, and timeframes.Follow up for all parties involved to answer any questions, provide timely feedback, and ensure the assigned tasks were completed.Maintain regular contact with both internal and external partners assisting in the investigation. Requests by Law Enforcement to Refrain or Delay Interviewing Alleged Maltreaters Law enforcement may request DFCS refrain or delay interviewing the alleged maltreater due to a criminal case. The SSCM still has a primary obligation to ensure child safety. In thissituation open and clear communication with law enforcement is necessary so that each agency understands what is required. When the alleged maltreater has access to the alleged victim child(ren) and a safety determination cannot be made without conducting an interview, communicate directly with law enforcement to coordinate the interview or to obtain a transcript of the interview conducted by law enforcement. When it is determined that the SSCM will not be conducting a separate interview with the alleged maltreater, a list of questions or information that is needed from the alleged maltreater(s) can be provided to law enforcement to ask the during the interview. RESIDENTIAL FACILITIESResidential facilities provide full-time (24-hour) residential care to children and youth, outside of their home.Child Care Institutions (CCI)CCI are residential facilities that provides full-time Room, Board and Watchful Oversight (RBWO) to six or more children through 18 years of age outside of their home environment.

A special investigation of a Residential and Non-Residential Facility requires a comprehensive assessment of all alleged victim children (in parental custody or in foster care) and facility caregiver(s). This includes assessing safety, maltreatment, and service needs. Facility investigations demand that the SSCM evaluates caregiver protective capacities information differently than the traditional in home setting. Evaluating the alleged maltreater requires the SSCM to determine if the caregiver(s) exhibits the protective capacities needed to manage all children under his/her care. This means that not only are the vulnerabilities ofthe alleged victim child pertinent to the investigation, but other children under the care of the alleged maltreater must also be assessed to determine how their vulnerabilities impact the current situation. In addition, some facility settings use a team caregiving approach. In these situations, evaluating the alleged maltreater as a part of the caregiving team is also required. It may be necessary to engage the alleged victim childs household members to obtain information about child vulnerabilities and child functioning. Understanding how the alleged victim child functions in their home environment maybe critical in making a safety and maltreatment determination in a facility investigation. This will allow a comparison of child functioning in the care of the parent/guardian/legal custodian and in the care of facility staff member(s). The information can help determine if a facility staff members protective capacity impacted the alleged maltreatment at the facility. Collateral Contacts in a Residential/Non-Residential Facility InvestigationWhen conducting an investigation involving a residential or non-residential facility the SSCM must assess which collateral contacts will contribute to an understanding of the situation and/or can provide information on the overall treatment of children at the facility. The usual collateral contacts may not be relevant for an out-of-home setting such as a residential or non-residential facility. For example, it may not help determine if maltreatment occurred at a day camp by contacting the victim ",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-6-special-investigations-section-65-conducting-special

Similarly	 speaking to the childs doctor about whether the child receives adequate medical care would not be relevant when the facility is not responsible for that care. On the other hand	 it may be important for the SSCM to make certain collateral contacts in a residential or non- residential investigation that may not apply in a familial case. These may include:Other children residing in	 attending	 or previously attended programs at the residential or non-residential facility.Parents	 guardians	 or legal custodians of other children who attend or previously attended the residential or non-residential facility.Persons who currently or previously worked or volunteered in the residential or non- residential facility (including any provider or staff on duty at the time of the alleged incident who routinely provide care to the alleged victim children).Other persons	 such as physical or speech therapists	 food service personnel	 etc.	 who may have information relevant to the allegations in the report and to the safety of the children in the residential or non-residential facility. Service Provision in a Residential/Non-Residential Facility InvestigationService provisions can be used to preserve placements for children in foster care	 where no safety issues have been identified	 to help the facility manage challenging tasks. When a need has been identified for a child in foster care	 the DFCS Investigator should notify the Permanency SSCM during the special investigations 48-hour multidisciplinary staffing or sooner (if urgent) to arrange services in accordance with the policy 19.17 Case Management: Service Provision. Similarly	 when the assessment identifies needs of the children in parental custody	 service provisions are used to address any non-safety issues (ex: Babies Cant Wait (BCW)	 Job Search	 Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)	 Medicaid	 Childcare and Parent Services (CAPS)	 etc.). When there is safety concern related to an alleged victim child in care of their parent	 guardian	 or legal custodian a new intake report is required.Placement Moves of Children in DFCS Custody During a Special InvestigationAlthough it is the responsibility of DFCS to ensure that a childs needs are being met by his/her caregiver	 children in foster care should not be subjected to unnecessary placement moves as each placement disruption is traumatic to the child and may result in emotional challenges. Therefore	 the placement should not be disrupted unless the child is determined to be unsafe. Department of Early Care and Learning (DECAL) - Enforcement ActionsThe major responsibilities of the Child Care Services division (CCS) of the DECAL include regulating the states childcare programs to ensure they are meeting basic health and safety requirements and supporting/helping programs to meet those requirements. Regulating childcare programs involves issuing an enforcement action when a program is not following current rules and regulations. The enforcement actions that may be used range from providing technical assistance to	 in rare cases	 license revocations. Regulation is part of DECALs legal authority. Enforcement Actions for a child care program can be located by conducting an enforcement action search on DECALs website at http://decal.ga.gov/EnforcementActions/Search.aspx.Requesting Criminal History Record InformationA criminal history check maybe warranted during a special investigation when there is an indication that an individual who has a caregiving role may have criminal history that impacts child safety; or when an individuals behavior indicates he/she may be	 or have been	 involved in criminal activity that could impact child safety. FORMS AND TOOLSA Guide to Gathering Information During Investigations Human Trafficking Case Management Statewide Protocol Infant Safe to Sleep Guidelines and ProtocolIntimate Partner Violence (Domestic Violence) Guidelines & Protocol ""	https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-6-special-investigations-section-65-conducting-special",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-6-special-investigations-section-65-conducting-special

DFCS County Departments are responsible for evaluating, approving, and monitoring kinship foster care placements. Helpful Hints in Foster Care Kinship Placement InvestigationsKinship caregivers may often be surprised and hurt when notified about a report of alleged maltreatment. They are often not prepared for what the investigative process entails and may show reluctance in participating. The Permanency SSCM or Kinship Coordinator may be able to provide support to the kinship caregiver during the investigative process and assist the investigator in gaining cooperation. DFCS partnership with the kinship caregiver can present challenges when it comes to conducting objective investigations. As with any other type of investigation, DFCS must conduct a thorough assessment that does not rely solely on information provided by the caregiver. Statements must be verified through collateral contacts (e.g., doctors, therapists, school personnel, etc.). DFCS must avoid prematurely drawing conclusions solely based on the age, behavioral or mental health history of the alleged victim. This can be accomplished while simultaneously treating the caregiver with the same courtesy and respect afforded all families DFCS encounters. Assessment of Foster Care Kinship PlacementsKinship caregivers are important partners in caring for children in foster care. They not only provide care for, nurture, and support the children temporarily under their supervision they may also be providing care to children in their legal custody (i.e. biological or adopted children). An investigation includes assessing the safety, maltreatment, family functioning and the service needs of all household members. In a special investigation of a foster care kinship placementthis will consist of the children in foster care, kinship caregivers, and all children in the physical and legal custody of the kinship caregiver. This also includes children in legal custody of the kinship caregiver, who do not reside in the home. Service provisions can be used to preserve placements for children in foster care, where no safety issues have been identified, by helping the family manage difficult situations they are facing in their lives. Similarly, when the assessment identifies needs of the children in the legal custody of the kinship caregiver, service provisions are used to preserve the family. The investigating SSCM should notify the Permanency SSCM or Kinship Coordinator during the multidisciplinary staffing or sooner (if urgent) to arrange services in accordance with the policy19.17 Case Management: Service Provision. DFCS can refer to formal or informal providers to address any identified needs which include but are not limited to Prevention of Unnecessary Placement (PUP), wraparound, Babies Cant Wait (BCW), plan of safe care, substance use disorder treatment, intimate partner violence/domestic violence services, etc. In some circumstances, Family Preservation Services (FPS) or Permanency may be required to address safety issues for children in the legal custody of the kinship caregiver. When this occurs, services for the kinship caregiver and the children in their legal custody are arranged and provided through the FPS or Permanency case. Children in foster care cannot remain in the kinship caregivers home when there is an active safety threat and the resource may not be used for additional DFCS placements. Consideration may be given on a case by case basis to achieve permanency for a child in DFCS custody through the waiver process (see policy14.23 Resource Development: Home Closure). Placement Moves of Children in DFCS Custody During a Special InvestigationChildren in foster care should not be subjected to unnecessary placement moves as each placement disruption is traumatic and may result in emotional challenges. Therefore, the placement should not be disrupted unless the child is determined to be unsafe. Additionally, any child who has a permanency plan of adoption or guardianship, or who is in the process of adoption, should not be removed from the caregivers home before the case is staffed with the Adoption Exchange State Permanency Unit unless present danger is indicated. Children in DFCS custody shall not remain in any home when safety threats are identified, when there is a substantiated case disposition, or a policy violation recommendation for home closure. Do not return a child removed from a placement under these circumstances unless a waiver to return the child is approved by the State Office. Requests by Law Enforcement to Refrain or Delay Interviewing Alleged Maltreaters Law enforcement may request DFCS refrain or delay interviewing the alleged maltreater due to a criminal case. The SSCM still has a primary obligation to ensure child safety. In this situation open and clear communication with law enforcement is necessary so that each agency understands what is required. When the alleged maltreater has access to the alleged victim child(ren) and a safety determination cannot be made without conducting an interview, communicate directly with law enforcement to coordinate the interview or to obtain a transcript of the interview conducted by law enforcement. When it is determined that the SSCM will not be conducting a separate interview with the alleged maltreater, a list of questions or information that is needed from the individual(s) can be provided to law enforcement to ask the during the interview.Requesting Criminal History Record InformationA criminal history check maybe warranted during a special investigation when there is an indication that an individual who has a caregiving role may have criminal history that impacts child safety; or when an individuals behavior indicates he/she may be, or have been, involved in criminal activity that could impact child safety. FORMS AND TOOLSA Guide to Gathering Information During Investigations Human Trafficking Case Management Statewide Protocol Infant Safe to Sleep Guidelines and ProtocolIntimate Partner Violence (Domestic Violence) Guidelines & Protocol",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-6-special-investigations-section-64-conducting-special

Similarly, DFCS adoptive homes provide care for children in foster care, however, the adoptive parents have formally committed to adopting the child(ren) in their home. In addition, DFCS kinship foster homes or kinship adoptive homes, share the same corresponding responsibilities and requirements though the caregivers are kin to the children placed in their home. DFCS County Departments through the Regional Resource Development are responsible for evaluating, approving, and monitoring DFCS foster or adoptive homes.Child Placing Agency (CPA) Foster or Adoptive HomesCPA foster homes provides temporary care for children in foster care. Similarly, CPA adoptive homes provide care for children in foster care, however, the adoptive parents have formally committed to adopting the children in their home. CPA foster and adoptive homes are evaluated, approved, and administered by a CPA. A CPA is any institution, society, agency, or facility which places children in foster homes for temporary care or in prospective adoptive homes for adoption. The DFCS Office of Provider Management (OPM) and Residential Child Care Licensing are the oversight authorities for CPA foster or adoptive homes. Helpful Hints in Foster or Adoptive Home InvestigationsFoster or adoptive parents may often be surprised and hurt when notified about a report of alleged maltreatment. They are often not prepared for what the investigative process entails and may show reluctance in participating. The RD SSCM or CPA case worker and an advocate (if the foster or adoptive parent chooses to have one present) are resources available to provide support to the foster or adoptive parent during the investigative process. DFCS partnership with foster and adoptive parents can present challenges when it comes to conducting objective investigations. As with any other type of investigation, DFCS must conduct a thorough assessment that does not rely solely on information provided by the foster or adoptive parent. Statements must be verified through collateral contacts (e.g., doctors, therapists, school personnel, etc.). DFCS must avoid prematurely drawing conclusions solely based on the age, behavioral or mental health history of the alleged victim. This can be accomplished while simultaneously treating the foster or adoptive parents with the same courtesy and respect afforded all families encountered. Foster Parents Request for an AdvocateAdvocates are available to help the foster parent navigate through the complex and sometimes confusing process of addressing issues with DFCS. Support of an advocate is a right by law under the Foster Parents Bill of Rights. Foster parents have the right to request an advocate during all aspects of the investigation where the foster parent is present. DFCS and CPA foster, or adoptive parents can request an advocate by contacting the Adoptive and Foster Parent Association of Georgia (AFPAG) at www.afpag.net or call 1-877-804-6610. When a foster parent requests an advocate the interview of the foster parent should be deferred until the advocate is present. However, a request for an advocate does not preclude DFCS from conducting the child safety assessment and/or taking immediate and appropriate action to control safety threats. The SSCM must proceed with the safety assessment of all children in the home, this includes children in DFCS custody as well as any children in the legal custody of the foster or adoptive parent. If the SSCM is unable to make a child safety determination without interviewing the foster parent, the SSCM must consult with the SSS concerning next steps. Assessment of Foster or Adoptive HomesFoster parents are important partners in caring for children in foster care. They not only provide care for, nurture, and support the children temporarily under their supervision they may also be providing care to children in their legal custody (i.e., biological or adopted children). Aninvestigation includes assessing the safety, maltreatment, family functioning and service needs of all household members. In a special investigation of a foster or adoptive home this will consist of the children in foster care, foster or adoptive parents, and children in the legal custody of the foster or adoptive parents. This also includes children in legal custody of the foster or adoptive parents, who do not reside in the home. Service Provision in a Foster or Adoptive Home InvestigationService provision can be used to preserve placements for children in foster care, where no safety issues have been identified, by helping the family manage difficult situations they are facing in their lives. Similarly, when the assessment identifies needs of the children in the legal custody of the foster/adoptive parent, service provisions are used to preserve the family. The investigating SSCM should notify the Permanency SSCM or resource maintainer (RD SSCM or CPA worker) during the multidisciplinary staffing or sooner (if urgent) to arrange services in accordance with the policy 19.17 Case Management: Service Provision. DFCS can refer to formal or informal providers to address any identified needs which include but are not limited to Prevention of Unnecessary Placement (PUP), wraparound, Babies Cant Wait (BCW), plan of safe care, substance use disorder treatment, intimate partner violence/domestic violence services, etc. In some circumstances, Family Preservation Services (FPS) or Permanency may be required to address safety issues for children in the legal custody of the foster/adoptive parent. When this occurs, services for the foster/adoptive parent and the children in their legal custody are arranged and provided through the FPS or Permanency case. Children in foster care cannot remain in the foster/adoptive parents home when there is an active safety threat and the resource may not be used for additional DFCS placements. Consideration may be given on a case-by-case basis to achieve permanency for a child in DFCS custody through the waiver process (see policy 14.23 Resource Development: Home Closure). Placement Moves of Children in DFCS Custody During a Special InvestigationChildren in foster care should not be subjected to unnecessary placement moves as each placement disruption is traumatic and may result in emotional challenges. Therefore, the placement should not be disrupted unless the child is determined to be unsafe. Additionally, any child who has a permanency plan of adoption or guardianship, or who is in the process of adoption, should not be removed from the caregivers home before the case is staffed with the Adoption Exchange State Permanency Unit unless present danger is indicated. Children in DFCS custody shall not remain in any home when safety threats are identified, when there is a substantiated case disposition, or a policy violation recommendation for home closure. Do not return a child removed from a placement under these circumstances unless a waiver to return the child is approved by the State Office. Requests by Law Enforcement to Refrain or Delay Interviewing Alleged Maltreaters Law enforcement may request DFCS refrain or delay interviewing the alleged maltreater due to a criminal case. The SSCM still has a primary obligation to ensure child safety. In this situation open and clear communication with law enforcement is necessary so that each agency understands what is required. When the alleged maltreater has access to the alleged victim child(ren) and a safety determination cannot be made without conducting an interview, communicate directly with law enforcement to coordinate the interview or to obtain a transcriptof the interview conducted by law enforcement. When it is determined that the SSCM will not be conducting a separate interview with the alleged maltreater, a list of questions or information that is needed from the individual(s) can be provided to law enforcement to ask the during the interview. Requesting Criminal History Record InformationA criminal history check maybe warranted during a special investigation when there is an indication that an individual who has a caregiving role may have criminal history that impacts child safety; or when an individuals behavior indicates he/she may be, or have been, involved in criminal activity that could impact child safety. FORMS AND TOOLSA Guide to Gathering Information During Investigations Human Trafficking Case Management Statewide Protocol Infant Safe to Sleep Guidelines and ProtocolIntimate Partner Violence (Domestic Violence) Guidelines & Protocol ",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-6-special-investigations-section-63-conducting-special

Contacts should be well planned and have a clear purpose. In order to thoroughly assess a childs safety	 permanency and well-being	 it is important to assess the functioning of the family that is caring for the child. Some key principles to keep in mind when performing purposeful contacts include:Recognizing the family providing care as a system - Each member of the family	 including the child	 has a role and responsibility within the family. If any one person is unable to fullfil their responsibilities	 then the whole family is impacted.Engagement and partnership buidling - purposeful contacts are not only about engaging and building a relationship with the caregiver	 but also about engaging and building a relationship with the entire family including absent parents.Involvement of families and youth - Because each member of a family has a role and responsibilities	 it is essential to obtain input from all family members when assessing family functioning. When family members are engaged	 this will re-affirm their importance in ensuring the success of the family system.Recognizing all members are individuals  Each family members will adjust differently to challenges to everyday life tasks. It is important to recognize the individuality of each family member and the impact DFCS involvement has on their lives.Cultural awareness - Each family has their own culture. Culture impacts family rituals and traditions. As family functioning is assessed	 we must be respectful of all cultures involved and how they impact the functioning of the family.Empathy	 authenticity and transparency - During purposeful contact with family	 we should be mindful of these three words: empathy	 authenticity and transparency. When engaging we must be able to identify with their thoughts and feelings even though we may not always agree. We also must be genuine and open in our communication with all family members and recognize that we have some accountability regarding the success or failure of the family. Purposeful contacts are also a time for the family to hold us accountable for what we may or may not be doing on behalf of the family who has joined in partnership with us.Remaining focused on safety	 permanency and well-being throughout the process. Minimizing Trauma to Children During an Investigation1Many children coming into the child welfare system have been traumatized by experiences of abuse or neglect. This trauma is often chronic and/or complex	 meaning that it has been sustained over a period	 started at a very young age (when the child is most vulnerable) and perpetrated by someone who the child depends on for protection and care. Trauma can have serious short-term and long-term effects on childrens development such as attachment	 cognition	 mood regulation	 behavior control	 physiology	 dissociation	 and self-concept. Children who have been exposed to trauma expend a great deal of energy responding to	 coping with	 and coming to terms with the traumatic event(s). This may reduce their capacity to master developmental tasks. The longer traumatic stress goes untreated	 the farther children tend to stray from appropriate developmental pathways. Considering that children who enter the child welfare system may have already experienced trauma	 it is especially important that they not be further traumatized by the system that seeks to help them and that they receive services as soon as possible to facilitate their recovery from the trauma they have experienced. The potential for children to be traumatized during the process of investigation is high	 as these processes often involve conflictual interactions between professionals and family members and can evoke fear	 resistance	 and hostility. In order to reduce the chance of further traumatizing children during an investigation the following are some Trauma Informed Practice Strategies (T.I.P.S.) for Caseworkers:Plan investigations	 assessments	 possible removals ahead as much as possible; reduce the element of surprise:Slow down	 plan out investigations and removals;Let the family know an assessment is going on	 that removal is a possibility	 when applicable;Suggest they keep a school aged child at home	 so the child does not have to be interviewed at school;Work with the parents to identify support individuals for their children during the assessment and/or for placement resources  kinship caregivers	 friends	 etc. Ask the parent and the child	 who does this child know and trust; andCollaborate with other agencies	 especially law enforcement. How can you better collaborate out in the field; clarify roles and expectations.Try to keep things calm during the investigation	 assessment and when necessary	 removal. Engage the parents in helping the child:Remain calm; move slowly;Talk the parents down. Calm the parents to calm the child; andSeparate children from the chaos of arrest	 interrogation	 or resistance on the part of the parents.Empathize	 connect	 and try to understand the childs perspective:Be open to listening if they want to talk;Acknowledge their feelings and the difficulty of what they are going through; andAcknowledge their love for their parents and their parents love for them.4. Provide information to the child:Explain what is happening;Assure them this is not their fault	 they are safe	 and will be cared for; andDo not make promises you cannot keep.Provide services aimed at healing and wellbeing as soon as possible	 including trauma informed services:Make sure the child has someone to talk to about what is happening that they feel comfortable with;Obtain a mental health assessment; and when necessaryObtain counseling and/or other trauma informed therapy for the child. Observing Children for Physical Signs of MaltreatmentObserving children for physical signs of maltreatment is an important part of ensuring child safety. To determine if there is cause to believe a child has been physically harmed	 consider the following:Non-verbal cues from the child or the caregiver that raise concern.The age and special needs of the child. Young children and those with certain special needs are especially vulnerable and may not be able to verbalize when they are being abused or neglected. Therefore	 the SSCM cannot depend on the child to say how they are feeling and must be keenly aware of non-verbal cues. For instance	 if the child is wincing or drawing back slightly	 it may be an indication of pain.Statements made by the child	 other children/household members/collaterals	 etc. that indicate him/her may have been subjected to physical harm or neglect	 etc.Physical indicators of maltreatment such as suspicious injuries	 marks	 cuts	 bruises	 areas of swelling	 protruding limbs	 damaged skin	 malnourishment	 unexplained weight loss	 lethargy	 severe tooth decay	 matted hair	 pungent body odor	 etc.The child resides with the caregiver or other individual that harmed the child or another child.The child indicates that physical discipline is being used; or that inappropriate methods of discipline is utilized by the caregiver or others in the home. The SSCM may need to view areas of a childs body that are covered by clothing to observe for signs of maltreatment and determine if the child needs medical treatment. This may require that the child (or caregiver for younger children) adjust their clothing. This can be embarrassing and anxiety provoking for the child. SSCMs must be sensitive to the childs level of comfort and make every effort to reduce their discomfort. This can be accomplished by having an adult present that the child knows and trusts	 and by asking the child or the caregiver (for children four years and under or those with special needs) to adjust one area of a childs clothing at a time. Asking the child or the caregiver to raise a childs pant leg or shirt sleeve one at a time	 is less invasive	 while allowing the SSCM to observe for signs of maltreatment. The child should never be fully unclothed. When possible	 arrange for a staff person of the same sex as the child to conduct the observation. Assessing InjuriesSome characteristics of injuries are considered red flags and warrant further scrutiny	 these include but are not limited to:Injuries on children who are not mobile	 especially infants.Injuries on protected surfaces of the body	 such as the back and buttocks	 ears	 insidethe mouth	 the neck	 arms or legs	 and underarms.Multiple injuries in various stages of healing (i.e.	 skin injuries	 lesions of varying ages	 bruises).Patterned trauma	 even if the object used to commit the abuse cannot be determined.Injuries that routine	 age-appropriate supervision of the child should have prevented.Significant injury with either no explanation or an explanation that is not plausible. Medical personnel are trained to detect signs of abuse or neglect that may otherwise go unnoticed. Whenever there is a question of whether a child needs to be examined by a medical professional	 have the caregiver seek a medical consultation (e.g.	 24-hour nurse helpline	 poison control center). If medical treatment is recommended	 insist the caregiver take the child to be examined by a medical professional within a specific timeframe. The SSCM also needs to observe the scene of the injury	 to ascertain whether the caregiver and/or childs statement of what happened is plausible.Ask the caregiver and/or child to show him/her exactly what happened	 and where.Note anything about the physical environment that refutes the statement(s) provided. For example	 if the caregiver claims that the child fell out of bed and hit their head on the floor	 causing a severe bruise	 the SSCM should look at the bed	 the floor	 and height from the bed to the floor. Is the floor carpeted? Is it plausible that the injury occurred on the carpeted floor?Obtain a detailed	 precise timeline of events surrounding the issue/event or track the sequence of events. The more detailed the history	 the more likely the assessment of the injury will be accurate. This can be helpful when communicating with medical staff to determine if the injury could have been caused in the manner described by the caregiver and/or child. Separating Intentions from ActionsAn individual can experience differing even conflicting feelings about any given situation. It is not uncommon to have two thoughts on the same subject I would like to...	 but I am scared. Individuals who may have caused harm to a child also experiences these conflicting feelings. He deserved to be punished for not following the rules¦	 but I didnt mean to hurt him. He just would not stop crying	 I was exhausted and wanted to sleep¦.	 but I didnt mean to shake him that hard. Separating intentions from actions means joining in partnership with the part of the persons thoughts (intentions) related to not wanting this event to occur again	 while helping them to acknowledge their unacceptable actions. Two methods used to help separate intentions from actions are: Normalizing Family StrugglesNormalizing is a form of empathy (understanding) that acknowledges the familys problems is part of the struggle of negotiating difficult life cycle stages	 as well as strengths and efforts in coping with the problems. It also helps families learn that many others are in the same situation. It does not downplay or dismiss the problem. It also does not condone or endorse the harmful behavior. For example	 can you remember failing a test in college to only find out most of the classfailed the test too? It does not remove the failing grade	 but deep down it does make you feel a little better that others are in the same situation. Sometimes knowing others failed too provides confirmation that the test was difficult. It is not unusual for families to start off defensively in their relationship with the case manager. Sometimes a simple introduction can evoke a defensive response from the family. Normalizing can enable an assessment to be more complete by minimizing the possibility of the family or individual becoming defensive and refusing to engage with the case manager. When a partnership is not established	 information is not being shared openly	 therefore obstructing the gathering information process (assessment). Normalizing a familys struggles can reduce the risk of defensive behavior by the family by attributing the familys problems to struggles associated with difficult life cycle stages. ProblemNormalizing LanguageFather who locked his teenage daughter in the basement to prevent her from leaving the house during the night while he sleeps.Teenagers today sometimes fail to understand the dangerous out in the world and the struggles to keep them away from harm. I found it so difficult when dealing with my teenage daughter	 particularly if I knew she washanging with the wrong crowd. You must feel horrible	 how did the evening start?A mother who has neglected her children due to drug use (previous sex abuse victim by the biological father). Single mothers say all the time how hard it is raising children alone; I can only imagine how difficult it is to focus on the constant demands of raising two children while simultaneously trying to overcome the abuse yousustained as a child. It must be so hard. Tell me when you noticed things were more than you could handle?A mother who (education) neglects her children.As a parent	 I found mornings extremely stressful. It took all I had to get the children up and out of the house to catch the school bus on time. I am sure it is especially difficult for you when your child makes up illnesses to avoid going to school and you do not have a car to transport him to school if he misses the. Tell me whenthis began.Foster mother spanks a child in foster care in her home. (policy violation assessment)A lot of foster parents have expressed how challenging it is to integrate a child into their home when the child may have come from a home with different rules or values. How did this all get started?Kinship caregiver placement resource who spanked a child in foster care placed in their home who is diagnosed ADHD.Kinship caregivers who agree to be a placement resource for the child often experience problems adhering to the no spanking guidelines required by DFCS	 especially when they have cared for the child before the child went into foster care and was able to use physical discipline with the child. Tell what behaviors youwere trying to deter?Adolescent in foster care who is experiencing problems adjusting to the school environment after being brought into foster care.I understand you are trying to focus on school	 but it is hard to focus after being removed from your family and placed into foster care. Teenagers have told me how difficult it is returning to school after being brought into foster care and everyone at school is aware of thesituation. Tell me about that.Adolescent in foster care who is having a problem establishing his career objectivesfor the creation of the WTLP.Teenagers often have trouble pinpointing their career path	 it seems so far off and not like a big deal at this age.Lets talk about it	 what things are you good at?Adoptive parents who are experiencing doubts about adopting a child.This is not uncommon	 several adoptive parents have expressed their apprehension to adopting a child following the adoptive placement	 you are not alone	 and adding a member to your family is a difficult process. Tell me about your concerns.A non-custodial parent who has a limited bond with the child wants to be a kinship caregiver placement. (Kinship care assessment)Parents who do not live with their child and only see the child sporadically	 say it is very challenging to establish and maintain a bond with the child	 particularly when the relationship with the caregiver who is caring for the child each day is strained. Tell me about that.A non-custodial parent who has a limited interaction with the child wants to be a kinship caregiver placement. (Kinship care assessment)I understand you were trying to get yourself financially established before engaging in your childs life because you wanted to have something to offer your child. Parents who are not involved in their childs life or have limited interactions with their child often say it is difficult to just show up when you have nothing tangible to offer. Tell me about this.  Externalizing the Problem PatternExternalizing the problem allows the family or individual to detach themselves from their problem. Externalizing the problem does not mean minimizing the personal responsibility or shifting blame	 rather	 it allows the individual to view the problem as something that is separate from their identity as a person. In short	 the person is not the problem	 the problem is the problem. Language that externalizes the problem can reduce criticism	 blame	 and guilt. If one of the family members has an anger problem	 externalizing the problem will free up the family to work on the problem rather than exhausting energy opposing each other or defending themselves. This opens the opportunity for the SSCM to work with the family to address the problem.For example	 asking the individual	 How long have you struggled with the problem of controlling your temper? Has the anxiety problem been around for a while? Can you see how anxiety has limited your family from engaging in fun activities? If your family wasnt plagued with the anxiety problem	 what kind of activities would your family enjoy? ProblemExternalizing LanguageMother who beats her child (prior abuse victim)Maybe you would like to put an end to this cycle of violence that has been passed on to you; would you liketo be one to defeat this monster and keep it from hurting future generations.Stepfather who slapped his teenage stepdaughterWhen you described those episodes when everybody gets into it and you end up losing it	 you seemed to be saying that you hate these episodes because they keepyou from being the father you really want to be to your stepdaughter.Mother who neglects her children due to depressionThis dark curtain that you mentioned	 tell me about a time when you fought back	 or slipped by	 or fooled thisdark curtain that descends on you.A mother who neglected her child due to drug use.When you said you vowed not to be like your mom and use drugs and not care for your children	 you seemed to be saying the drug use keeps you from being the mother you really want to be to your children.  Engagement of the Noncustodial ParentEngagement of noncustodial parents is more than contacting them inquiring as to their interestin being involved with the child(ren). It requires trying to understand their situation and why they may feel the way they do. It is important to be aware of certain dynamics that may come into play in this process. Their behavior may be in response to previous negative experiences they have had with the custodial parent	 preconceived notions about how they are perceived by others regarding the status of their parental involvement	 or they may be reluctant because of their views about the child welfare system. Engagement of noncustodial parents can be facilitated by educating them on the process and exploring with them their possible role and how they can be a resource for the child (ren). The discussions with the custodial parent surrounding the involvement of the non-custodial parent need to occur during the development of the case plan. Engagement should revolve around the noncustodial parents presence/engagement in the childs life	 caregiving abilities	 cooperative parenting	 and emotional contributions to the child. A determination must be made about the non-custodial parent involvement with the child and their ability to contribute the outcomes of the case plan prior to establishing contact standards for the non-custodial parent. Observing Parent/Guardian and Child InteractionDirect observation of parent and child interactions: What is the quality of the parent and child bonding? Does the parent engage the child in developmentally stimulating activities? Does the parent handle the child roughly or is there an apparent comfort level in providing for the child's needs? Does the parent identify the child's needs and respond to them in a nurturing way? Does the child seem fearful of the parent? Parent-child interaction in the parents home should be observed prior to reunification. Hearing and seeing how the parent and child communicate: Is communication verbal	 non- verbal	 physical	 positive	 negative	 passive	 more negative than positive? Determine if progress on the specified steps of the case plan are met: What changes in the parent's interaction with a child are observed since the previous meeting and/or the implementation of service provisions (i.e.	 counseling	 parenting skills training)? Is the parent learning and practicing better ways of parenting? Are they utilizing their action plan to avoid	 interrupt or escape situations that would usually lead to high-risk behaviors? Does the parent redirect the child when unwanted behaviors are noticed? If service provision is effective	 there should be evidence of enhanced parenting skills. These are only a few of the many insights that may be gained from direct observation of parent and child interactions. Using what is directly observed as a major component of case decision making is vital. A case decision based only on what is reported by the parent is never enough. Why to Make Contacts in the HomeIt is important to visit children in the home environment to assess safety and gain an understanding of the childs living conditions. It is recommended that contacts be made in the home as often as possible. There is helpful information that may be gathered when interacting with parents and children in their home environment and it is important to make firsthand observations of the home environment to which the child may be returning.Announced or Unannounced Home Visits2The nature of the reported allegations and the initial indication of the existence of a present danger situation or impending danger safety threat must be the first consideration when determining whether to make an announced or unannounced visit. If there is a present danger situation	 this requires an immediate response	 regardless of where the child is located. When a present danger situation is not apparent initially	 the nature of the allegations and DFCS history	 as well as the consideration of whether an interview could be tainted by an adult are important considerations when determining whether to do an announced or unannounced visit. Making an unannounced visit should be associated with timeliness	 immediacy	 or emergency situations. Unannounced visits are not discouraged when they are appropriate	 but they should be necessary and justified based upon the individual circumstances of the case and its history. Supervisory consultation and guidance are an integral part of the discussion when preparing to engage a family during CPS intervention. A family needs to know that CPS is not there to catch them doing something	 but to act to protect a child. Therefore	 there needs to be a specific	 immediate	 and clearly observable reason that a case manager makes an unannounced visit. When a case manager is trying to build a partnership and consensus with a family	 he/ she must remember that courtesy and mutual respect is a core component of building effective and sustainable solutions to the difficult tasks or situations identified by a family. When possible	 a scheduled visit with a family can be an effective	 convenient	 and efficient process for all parties. The visit can be set to a time that is mutually convenient and include all household members. This alleviates the need to make multiple visits to complete interviews; saving time and effort for the case manager and caregiver(s) and shows an effort to be courteous and respectful of the family and their time. Purposeful Contacts When the Caregiver or Child Resides in Another CountyCounty A may request County B to conduct a purposeful visit with a caregiver or child who is residing or temporarily living in County B if County A cannot conduct the visit. Both counties should have a discussion prior to the visit to address case plan goals	 the purpose of the visit and frequency of the visits. The assigned SSCM in County B should be added as a secondary SSCM in Georgia SHINES so that they may document the visit. Safe Sleeping Recommendations for Infants up to One Year of AgeCaregivers of infants (birth to 12 months old) must be informed of conditions that constitute a safe sleeping environment and that reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)	 also known as crib death. At minimum	 caregivers should be advised of the three primary safe sleep recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) commonly referred to as the ABCs of safe sleep:Alone  The babys sleep area should be close to	 but separate from	 where caregivers and others sleep. The sleeping area should be free of soft objects	 toys	 and loose bedding.Back  Infants should always be placed on their back to sleep for naps and at night.Crib  Place infants on a firm sleep surface	 such as on a safety approved crib mattress. covered by a fitted sheet.Further additional information and guidance regarding safe sleeping and SIDS/SUIDS see Infant Safe to Sleep Guidelines and Protocol in Forms and Tools. Motor Vehicle Safety RecommendationsChildren are sensitive to heat as their body temperature can heat up three to five times faster than an adults. Children will die if their body temperature exceeds 107 degrees. Even at a temperature of 60 degrees outdoors	 the temperature inside a car can exceed 110 degrees. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) recommends the following precautions to take in order to avoid child heatstroke.Never leave a child unattended in a vehicle  even if the windows are partially open or the engine is running	 and the air conditioning is on;Make a habit of looking in the vehicle  front and back  before locking the door and walking away;Ask the childcare provider to call if the child does not show up for care as expected;Do things that serve as a reminder that a child is in the vehicle	 such as placing a phone	 purse	 or briefcase in the back seat to ensure no child is accidentally left in the vehicle or writing a note or using a stuffed animal placed in the driver's view to indicate a child is in the car seat;Always lock your vehicle when not in use and store keys out of a childs reach	 so children cannot enter unattended. Teach children that a vehicle is not a play area;A child in distress due to heat should be removed from the vehicle as quickly as possible and rapidly cooled. PicturesPictures are useful for documenting injuries and/or the condition of the home environment; and may be used as evidence in an investigation or in court.When taking pictures to document injuries	 ensure the following:The caregiver and the child are informed of the need for taking the pictures.Each photograph should have one identifier present (i.e.	 piece of the childs clothing)	 at least one photograph should include the childs face and the clothing	 to assure that the evidence collected demonstrates the series of pictures of the same child.Use measurable objects (i.e.	 ruler	 coin	 pencil) to depict the size of the injury. Photograph the object that caused the injury (whether the injury was accidental or not).When taking pictures of the condition of the home related to safety hazards to the children	 include all the areas that demonstrate a safety hazard	 such as inside and outside the home	 including the yard	 when applicable.NOTE: If the safety hazard is an infant unsafe sleep situation	 take a picture of the area in which the infant currently sleeps.All pictures should be identified with the following information: the individuals who took the photo	 the date it was taken	 name and date of birth of the alleged child victim	 and if applicable the address where the injury occurred or the home with the safety hazards. Documenting Purposeful ContactsAll visits must be documented on the Contact Detail page in Georgia SHINES within 72 hours of the contact. A narrative must be completed for each Contact Detail. At a minimum	 the documentation entry must include:The type of contact (e.g.	 face-to-face	 announced	 unannounced	 etc.).The date the contact occurred.Person(s) present at the contact.The purpose of the contact.What was discussed.Where the contact occurred.Whether the caregiver or child was interviewed privately. If the child was not interviewed privately document the reason(s) why this did not occur.Summary of information (What happened at the visit):The developmental stage of the family and the everyday life task in which the family is struggling;Sequencing of the event/situation that is causing concern;Safety	 permanency	 and well-being issues discussed;Consensus developed with the caregivers;Child and parents involvement in safety planning;Safety determination (safe or unsafe);Safety plan management; andChange that was noticed and celebrated with the caregiver(s).Observations of the home environment	 children for injuries or signs of maltreatment and interactions of family members.Any concerns or red flags identified.Next steps and the plan for addressing identified issues or concerns	 as well as documentation of issue resolution. FORMS AND TOOLSA Guide to Gathering Information During Investigations Authorization for Release of InformationAuthorization for Release of Information - SpanishCaregivers Guide to a Child Protective Services (CPS) Investigation Caregivers Guide to a Child Protective Services (CPS) Investigation - Spanish Foster Parent Bill of Rights BrochureHuman Trafficking Case Management Statewide Protocol Infant Safe to Sleep Guidelines and ProtocolIntimate Partner Violence (Domestic Violence) Guidelines & Protocol Notice of Case Record Information Available to Parents/GuardiansNotice of Case Record Information Available to Parents/Guardians (Spanish) Notice of Privacy PracticesNotice of Privacy Practices - Spanish Notification of Child InterviewNotification of Child Interview - Spanish""	https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-6-special-investigations-section-62-purposeful",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-6-special-investigations-section-62-purposeful

If required, Limited English Proficiency and Sensory Impaired Customer Services (LEP/SI) is used to assist DFCS in providing meaningful language access to customers. Contact LEP/SI via lepsi@dhs.ga.gov. The use of family members as interpreters is not appropriate.Identify possible collaterals (see policy 19.16 Case Management: Collateral Contacts).Participate in a staffing with the SSS to present and discuss strategies for continuing the assessment, and reconfirm what was determined regarding the challenges the family was facing in their everyday life during the ISA.Gather forms and other required material, including but not limited to:A Caregiver's Guide to a Child Protection Services (CPS) Investigation (Brochure)Authorization for Release of InformationNotice of Case Record Information Available to Parents/GuardiansHIPAA Notice of Privacy PracticesSafe Sleep for Your Baby educational resourcesSuggestions for Parents/Tip SheetDocument the analysis of DFCS history and any preparation activities in Georgia SHINES Contact/Summaries as early as possible, but no later than within 72 hours of the occurrence.  Conducting Purposeful Contacts  Child/YouthThe SSCM will:Engage the child in a private face-to-face conversation as part of the assessment of child safety, permanency, and well-being. Use age and developmentally appropriate language and questions to assess and discuss:Each maltreatment allegation;The extent and circumstances of the maltreatment including the sequence of events that led up to and followed the incident (maltreatment) that everyone is concerned about, and including but not limited to the following:Who was present during the incident;How the destructive behavior (i.e., child left home alone, the child was disciplined with an extension cord, etc.) occurred;When does this problem occur;Who was involved; Who was not involved;Who did what and when;What usually occurs prior to the problem;What did the maltreater say about the problem after it occurred; What did others say about the problem after it occurred;How did he/she feel leading up to, during and following the problematic issue/event; and/orHave there been similar situations or events when the caregiver(s) or alleged maltreater (s) were able to manage without destructive behavior?Any needs, concerns, or fears of the child;Extracurricular activities or interests of the child;Involvement with absent parent(s)/non-custodial parent(s) and their families;Childs current living arrangement, including who resides in the home;Family relationships and role of each household member;Physical, educational, medical, and mental health needs; and any services the child is receiving; andIf the youth is identified as an Unaccompanied Homeless Youth:Reason(s) for the homelessness and potential solutions;Level of parental care and supervision, and length of time without parental care and supervision;Other persons that may be providing support to the youth;Youths access to education.Observe all children for physical signs maltreatment. If the child is four years old and under, or there is cause to believe any child has been harmed:In the least invasive manner possible, observe areas of the body that may be clothed.Explain to the caregiver and child the reason for observing areas of the body that may be covered by clothing.Arrange for an adult to be present when possible (e.g., caregiver, non- offending parent or legal guardian, relative, foster parent, school nurse, daycare staff, etc.).If the child is four years old and under, ask the caregiver to adjust one area at a time (e.g., raising a shirt sleeve, pant leg, raise the shirt to view their back, etc.), ask them to replace the clothing before proceeding to the next area of the body. Take pictures of any injuries noted.If the child is older than four and is capable, ask the child to adjust their own clothing as outlined above. NOTE: If a full examination is needed, a medical provider may be used.If observation of the child uncovers injuries or other signs of maltreatment:Determine whether there are any additional injuries that are not immediately apparent. Is there bruising or is the area sensitive to the touch? Does the child complain of discomfort or pain;Gather information around the circumstances surrounding the injury and the parents knowledge and response to the injury by asking who, what, when, where and how. What was used to cause the injury (ex: hand, fist, belt, bat, extension cord)? Describe the object that was used to cause the injury. Where did the incident that resulted in the injury occur (ex: bedroom, bathroom, grandmas kitchen?);Evaluate and determine whether injuries to the child, or the condition of the child requires an immediate medical or psychological evaluation or medical treatment;Whenever there is a question of whether or not a child needs to be examined by a medical professional, have the caregiver seek a medical consultation (e.g., 24-hour nurse helpline, poison control center).If medical treatment is recommended from the consult, insist the caregiver take the child to be examined by a medical professional within a specific timeframe.Document any observed injuries or physical signs of maltreatment by taking quality pictures and/or a detailed written description. NOTE: Pictures can also be used to document a lack of maltreatment, injury, or condition.Make a safety determination, in consultation with the SSS, prior to concluding each purposeful contact with the child (see policy 19.11 Case Management: Safety Assessment). If it is determined that the child is unsafe take immediate and appropriate action to control the safety threats to ensure child safety by:Developing and implementing with the caregiver an in-home or out-of-home safety plan 19.12 Case Management: Safety Plan & Management); and/orInitiating court/legal intervention (see policy 17.1 Legal: The Juvenile Court Process).Notify the caregiver when an interview with a child has been completed without prior caregiver permission immediately upon completion of the interview. It is not the responsibility of the child to notify the caregiver.Conducting Purposeful Contacts  Parent (Custodial/Non-Custodial), Caregiver, Adult Household Member or Alleged MaltreaterThe SSCM will:Engage each parent (custodial or non-custodial), caregiver, adult household member and alleged maltreater in a private face-to-face conversation to assess child safety, permanency, and well-being.Describe the investigation process. Answer any questions he/she may have and provide a copy of the Caregivers Guide to a Child Protective Services (CPS) Investigation.Explain DFCS obligation to maintain confidentiality and safeguard information to prevent unauthorized disclosure:Personal information provided during the completion of the investigation will be kept confidential (see policy 2.6 Information Management: Confidentiality/Safeguarding Information).DFCS cannot share protected health information (PHI) with any person, agency, or contractor without prior written authorization from the owner of the PHI, unless otherwise permitted by law.

Arrange for them to be interviewed prior to the conclusion of the assessment.Discuss with the caregiver(s), alleged maltreater(s), and other household members when injuries or signs of maltreatment were discovered during the observation of the child:When did the injury take place? Who was present during the incident that resulted in the injury?Was an object used to cause the injury (ex: hand, fist, belt, bat, extension cord)? Describe the object that was used to cause the injury (example: black belt with studs). Observe the object used to cause the injury.Where did the incident that resulted in the injury occur (ex: bedroom, bathroom, hallway, etc.)? Observe the specific location in the home where the incident occurred.Document the observation of the object or location of where the incident and/or injury occurred by taking quality pictures and/or a detailed written description.What was the caregivers response to the injury or being notified of the injury? Was medical treatment sought?Has the child suffered any other injuries or does the child have a history of injuries; andWhenever there is a question of whether a child needs to be examined by a medical professional, have the caregiver seek a medical consultation (e.g., 24- hour nurse helpline or poison control center). If medical treatment is recommended from the consult, insist the caregiver take the child to be examined by a medical professional within a specific timeframe.Identify with the caregiver the personal issue(s) one or more caregiver has that makes caring for the children difficult as it relates to child safety and risk. Identify skills that the individual possesses that help to manage unwanted behavior.Observe the family functioning and interactions around everyday tasks:Parent/caregiver-child interaction:How the caregiver(s) relates to the child;Whether the caregiver(s) appears to be calm, gentle, relaxed, and confident about parenting or if the caregiver appears anxious, easily frustrated, inattentive, indifferent, or detached; andWhat the caregiver(s) communicates to the child non-verbally (e.g., looks, touches, and gestures).Interactions of all household members; andThe caregivers ability to meet the needs of all children under their care and supervision.Assess the physical home environment to determine if it is safe and appropriate to meet the needs of each child:Examine every room in the home for present or potential environmental concerns or hazards. Take appropriate action to remedy environmental concerns or hazards (i.e., loose wires or cords, alcohol or beer bottles, any drug paraphernalia, broken glass or windows, medications or toxic cleaning items that are in reach of small children) prior to leaving the home;Review the sleeping arrangements for all household members;When an infant under one year of age is in the home, assess and discuss safe sleep practices with the caregiver(s). Take appropriate action to remedy unsafe sleep situations prior to leaving the home such as helping a caregiver to prepare a safe sleeping area for an infant (see Infant Safe to Sleep Guidelines and Protocol in Forms and Tools); NOTE: A caregivers willingness or unwillingness to address a safe sleep environment must be considered when evaluating caregiver protective capacities and documented in Georgia SHINES.Take pictures and/or document in writing the condition of the home when concerns or hazards are identified, this includes inside and outside of the home, including the yard, porch, etc.Discuss motor vehicle safety precautions including not leaving children unattended in cars (see Practice Guidance for Motor Vehicle Safety Recommendations).Build a consensus with the caregiver(s) regarding the family and individual problems identified by summarizing how the old plan does not seem to be working very well and how it seems a new plan needs to be developed to address the identified problems. NOTE: Family level challenges are not applicable in cases involving sexual abuse or domestic violence.Request an Authorization for Release of Information (ROI) be signed when it is necessary to obtain information about family members and/or initiate referrals. Obtain the signature of the subject of whom you are requesting information or the custodian or guardian of the child whom you are requesting information. Blank ROIs should not be requested. ROIs should be completed related to a specific request for information at the time signatures are obtained.Notice and celebrate the caregiver(s) positive behavioral change.Make a safety determination, in consultation with the SSS, prior to concluding each purposeful contact with the parent, caregiver, adult household member or alleged maltreater (see policy 19.11 Case Management: Safety Assessment). If it is determined that the child is unsafe, prior to leaving the home, take immediate and appropriate action to control the safety threats to ensure child safety by:Developing and implementing an in-home or out-of-home safety plan with the caregiver (see policy 19.12 Case Management: Safety Plan & Management); and/orInitiating court/legal intervention (see policy 17.1 Legal: The Juvenile Court Process).Thoroughly explain what will happen next and answer any questions he/she may have in relation to the Investigation process.  Analyzing Information Obtained During the Purposeful Contact and Follow upUpon the completion of each purposeful contact, the SSCM will:Immediately report to the CICC any new known or suspected instances of child abuse, neglect and/or exploitation using the guidelines outlined in policy 3.24 Intake: Mandated Reporters.Review and analyze the information gathered during the interview(s). Identify inconsistencies or discrepancies and develop a plan for resolving them. Follow up on inconsistencies and document when and how resolved.Make necessary safety decisions in response to information gathered during interviews and the visit to the home in consultation with the SSS.Consult with the SSS and/or other subject matter experts (i.e., Permanency Consultants, Regional Adoption Coordinator, Field Program Specialist) for assistance as needed.Obtain the SSS signature of approval on the safety plan developed with the family, if applicable during contact with the child/family.Document purposeful contacts in Georgia SHINES within 72 hours of occurrence, including updating the Person Detail Page and uploading any pictures, safety plans or documents to External Documentation.Conduct safety screenings on additional household members or caregivers revealed during purposeful contacts who were not identified at intake or ISA (see policy 19.9 Case Management: Safety Screenings).Engage individuals identified as collateral contacts to obtain pertinent and purposeful information for:Determining child safety, well-being, and permanency;Assessing caregiver protective capacities, and family functioning; andMonitoring progress, and managing the safety plan; and when applicable, satisfying the Conditions for Return (see policy 19.16 Case Management: Collateral Contacts).Make appropriate referrals necessary to implement needed services (see policy 19.17 Case Management: Service Provision).Follow up on commitments made during the visit.Identify areas for discussion and follow up during the next visit.Supervisors Role in Purposeful ContactsThe SSS will:Ensure purposeful contacts are occurring according to policy or as frequently as necessary to assess and ensure safety and determine family functioning.Use the following reports to track purposeful contacts:Investigations Response Time Report (Georgia SHINES); andLog of Contacts (Georgia SHINES).Assist the SSCM in preparing an agenda to ensure purposeful contacts are focused on the everyday life situations the family is having difficulty managing that makes the child(ren) unsafe or at risk.Ensure he/she is accessible to provide guidance and consult with the SSCM to discuss:Information gathered concerning areas of family functioning;Present danger situations or impending danger safety threats identified;A safety determination (safe or unsafe);The development of an in-home or out-of-home safety plan to control the present danger situation or impending danger safety threats; and/orThe sufficiency of the safety plan to mitigate safety threats.Document the supervisory staffing in Georgia SHINES within 72 hours of occurrence.Ensure purposeful contacts are documented timely in Georgia SHINES within 72 hours of the occurrence, including pictures and observations.Determine the sufficiency of the purposeful contacts through a Georgia SHINES documentation review, considering the following:Does the documentation support the purposeful contact(s) conducted and provide sufficient information to assess child safety and current family functioning;Is the information gathered sufficient to support the safety decision;Was the family engaged in manner that is conducive to building a partnership;Was the discussion with the family focused on the everyday life tasks the family is struggling with;Are inconsistencies documented that need to be resolved; andAre there any services that have been identified that need to be linked to the family?When inconsistencies or follow up is needed based on the review of documentation provide feedback and guidance to the SSCM in order to resolve the inconsistencies and ensure service provision as necessary and document when resolution has occurred. PRACTICE GUIDANCEAll contacts made with parents and their children provide an opportunity to build a trusting and supportive partnership. Contacts should be well planned and have a clear purpose. In order to thoroughly assess a childs safety, permanency, and well-being, it is important to assess the functioning of the family that is caring for the child. Some key principles to consider when conducting purposeful contacts include:Recognizing the family providing care as a systemEach member of the family, including the child, has a role and responsibilities within the family. If any one person is unable to fulfill their responsibilities, then the whole family is impacted.Engagement and partnership buildingPurposeful contacts are not only about engaging and building a relationship with the caregiver, but also about engaging and building a relationship with the entire family including absent parents.Involvement of families and youthBecause each member of a family has a role and responsibilities, it is essential to obtain input from all family members when assessing family functioning. When family members are engaged, this will re-affirm their significance in ensuring the success of the family system.Recognizing all members are individualsEach family member will adjust differently to challenges to everyday life tasks. It is important to recognize the individuality of each family member and the impact DFCS involvement has on their lives.Cultural awarenessEach family has their own culture. Culture impacts family rituals and traditions. As family functioning is assessed, being respectful of all cultures involved and how they impact the functioning of the family is important for engaging families and developing partnerships.Empathy, authenticity, and transparencyDuring purposeful contact with family, be mindful of empathy, authenticity, and transparency. When engaging families, it is important to identify their thoughts and feelings even if we may not always agree. Be genuine and open in communicating with all family members and recognize your accountability regarding the success or failure of the family. Purposeful contacts are also a time for the family to hold us accountable for what we may or may not be doing on behalf of the family who has joined in partnership with us.Remaining focused on safety, permanency, and well-being.Observing Children for Physical Signs of MaltreatmentObserving children for physical signs of maltreatment is an important part of ensuring child safety. To determine if there is cause to believe a child may be harmed, requiring the SSCM to view areas of the body that may be clothed, consider the following:Non-verbal cues from the child or the caregiver that raise concern.The age and special needs of the child. Young children and those with certain special needs are especially vulnerable and may not be able to verbalize when they are being abused or neglected. Therefore, the SSCM cannot depend on the child to say how they are feeling and must be keenly aware of non-verbal cues. For instance, if the child is wincing or drawing back slightly, it may be an indication of pain.Statements made by the child, other children/household members/collaterals, etc. that indicate him/her may have been subjected to physical harm, etc.Physical indicators of maltreatment such as suspicious injuries, marks, cuts, bruises, areas of swelling, protruding limbs, damaged skin, malnourishment, unexplained weight loss, lethargy, severe tooth decay, matted hair, pungent body odor, etc.The child resides with the caregiver or other individual that harmed the child or another child.The child indicates that physical discipline is being used; or that inappropriate methods of discipline is utilized by the caregiver or others in the home.The SSCM may need to view areas of a childs body that are covered by clothing to observe for signs of maltreatment and determine if the child needs medical treatment. This may require that the child (or caregiver for younger children) adjust their clothing. This can be embarrassing and anxiety provoking for the child. SSCMs must be sensitive to the childs level of comfort and make every effort to reduce their discomfort. This can be accomplished by having an adult present that the child knows and trusts, and by asking the child or the caregiver (for children four years and under or those with special needs) to adjust one area of a childs clothing at a time. Asking the child or the caregiver to raise a childs pant leg or shirt sleeve one at a time, is less invasive, while allowing the SSCM to observe for signs of maltreatment. When possible, arrange for a staff person of the same sex as the child to conduct the observation.Assessing InjuriesSome characteristics of injuries are considered red flags and warrant further scrutiny, these include but are not limited to:Injuries on children who are not mobile,",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-5-investigations-section-52-purposeful-contacts-during
GA :: Child Welfare Policy Manual :: Chapter 5 Investigations :: Section 5.2 Purposeful Contacts During An Investigation,Georgia,Rules,"2023, 2022, 2021","Administrative process, Definitions, Forms - Other, Investigations",,,"especially infants.Injuries on protected surfaces of the body	 such as the back and buttocks	 ears	 inside the mouth	 genitalia and inner thighs	 the neck	 arms or legs	 and underarms.Multiple injuries in various stages of healing (i.e.	 skin injuries	 lesions of varying ages	 bruises).Patterned trauma	 even if the object used to commit the abuse cannot be determined.Injuries that routine	 age-appropriate supervision of the child should have prevented.Significant injury with either no explanation or an explanation that is not plausible.The SSCM may also need to observe the scene of the injury	 to ascertain whether the caregiver and/or childs statement of what happened is plausible.Ask the caregiver and/or child to show him/her exactly what happened	 and where.Note anything about the physical environment that refutes the statement(s) provided. For example	 if the caregiver claims that the child fell out of bed and hit is head on the floor	 causing a severe bruise	 the SSCM should look at the bed	 the floor	 and height from the bed to the floor. Is the floor carpeted? Is it plausible that the injury occurred on the carpeted floor?Obtain a detailed	 precise timeline of events surrounding the incident or track the sequence of events. The more detailed the history	 the more likely the assessment of the injury will be accurate. This can be helpful when communicating with medical staff to determine if the injury could have been caused in the manner described by the caregiver and/or child.Document the caregivers/childs words in quotes. Whenever possible	 do not paraphrase. Clarify vague references to times	 places	 or observers.Documenting InjuriesAs injuries fade	 photographs are needed to document the injuries	 which may be used as evidence in an investigation or in court. When taking photographs of injuries (bruises	 lacerations	 etc.)	 ensure the following:The caregiver and the child are informed of the reason for taking the photographs.At least one photograph includes the adult witness with the alleged child victim.Each photograph should have one identifier present (i.e.	 piece of the childs clothing)	 at least one photograph should include the childs face and the clothing	 to assure that the evidence collected demonstrates the series of photographs of the same child.Use measurable objects (i.e.	 ruler	 coin	 pencil) to depict the size of the injury. Photograph the object that caused the injury (whether the injury was accidental or not)All photographs should be identified with the following information: the individuals who took the photo	 the date it was taken	 name and DOB of the alleged child victim	 and if applicable address of the living environment.Deliberate Information Gathering (DIG)1Seek to understand the caregiver	 his/ her point of view	 story	 and experience. That means to dig deeper for the information needed in order to understand the person	 the situation and how these help explain both threats to child safety and caregiver protective capacities. The DIG concept is to be very deliberate in gathering information and seeking to understand while behaving very naturally. The following interpersonal techniques can be used while gathering information:Attending BehaviorAttending behavior refers to focusing attention on the caregiver rather than the SSCMs agenda or line of questioning. Attending behavior involves matching a caregivers nonverbal behavior by consciously manipulating and controlling the SSCMs own nonverbal skills and responses. Primary attending behaviors include eye contact	 facial expressions	 body language	 posturing and gesturing	 following	 reflecting and vocal qualities-tone and pace.Open QuestionsOpen questions help to remove the SSCM from the responsibility of carrying the interview by establishing a conversational quality to the interaction. Open questions cannot be answered yes or no or in just a few words. Open questions require the caregiver to elaborate with a wider range of responses. Open questions are the what and how type questions.Closed QuestionsClosed questions should be used to restrict or narrow the focus of a caregivers response. Closed questions should be used purposefully when precise detail and greater clarity is needed from the caregiver. As an exception	 closed questions may be used more frequently when there are time constraints or when the SSCM is interviewing a caregiver who is very concrete or is not very verbal.ParaphrasingThe primary intent of paraphrasing is to facilitate the clarification of statements	 issues	 and concerns. Paraphrasing may involve the SSCM selecting and using a caregivers own keywords. Paraphrasing involves formulating the essential message that the caregiver is conveying and then stating that message back to the caregiver in the SSCMs own words. When paraphrasing	 check for accuracy of the statement by concluding the paraphrase with a simple question such as	 Is that correct? or Does that sound accurate?EncouragingThis technique serves to keep people talking about a particular topic	 issue	 or concern. Encouraging may be as simple as using a slight verbal prompt	 such as uh-huh	 I see	 go on	 or then what?Conversational LoopingConversational looping is a skill for gathering information that first involves the SSCM identifying some key general topic or area for discussion with a caregiver (e.g.	 approach to parenting	 problem-solving	 dealing with stress	 etc.). Once a topic has been identified	 begin the conversation with a broad non-threatening open question. As the conversation progresses related to the identified topic	 continue with a line of questioning (primarily open-ended) based on previous caregiver responses that progressively moves the discussion toward a more specific and intimate inquiry. A key1.Deliberate Information Gathering	 November 2006 ACTION for Child Protection	 Inc.to effective conversational looping is the ability of the interviewer to maintain a caregivers focus on a particular topic	 which will then enable the interviewer to gather more detailed information from the caregiver about the issue	 concern	 or topic inquiry.Example: Parenting ApproachSo	 how would you describe yourself as a parent? Where do you learn parenting skills from?What brings you the most satisfaction as a parent?How does what youre saying relate to your feelings about being a single parent? The content areas that are explored through conversational looping or for any technique are the family functioning areas.Reflective Listening StatementsReflective listening statements involve the SSCMs attempts to interpret what a caregiver believes	 thinks and/or feels	 and then state the SSCMs interpretation back to the caregiver. The interpretation of what the caregiver is communicating is based on both verbal responses and nonverbal cues from the caregiver. A statement is used rather than a question because the statement is less likely to produce caregiver resistance	 and	 further	 a statement triggers the caregiver to re-examine the accuracy of his/her perceptions and thoughts. Example:Caregiver: I may have a couple of beers every once in a while	 with my friends	 but I dont have a drinking problem.SSCM: For you	 drinking is no big deal¦its just something you do socially with your friends?Separating Intentions from ActionsAn individual can experience differing even conflicting feelings about any given situation. It is not uncommon to have two thoughts on the same subject I would like to...	 but I am scared. Individuals who may have caused harm to a child also experiences these conflicting feelings. He deserved to be punished for not following the rules¦	 but I didnt mean to hurt him. He just would not stop crying	 I was exhausted and wanted to sleep¦.	 but I didnt mean to shake him that hard.Separating intentions from actions means joining in partnership with the part of the persons thoughts (intentions) related to not wanting this event to occur again	 while helping them to acknowledge their unacceptable actions. Two methods used to help separate intentions from actions are:Normalizing Family StrugglesNormalizing is a form of empathy (understanding) that acknowledges the familys problems is part of the struggle of negotiating difficult life cycle stages	 as well as strengths and efforts in coping with the problems. It also helps families learn that many others are in the same situation. It does not downplay or dismiss the problem. It also does not condone or endorse the harmful behavior.For example	 can you remember failing a test in college to only find out the majority of the class failed the test too? It does not remove the failing grade	 but deep down it does make you feel a little better that others are in the same situation. Sometimes knowing others failed too provides confirmation that the test was difficult.It is not unusual for families to start off defensively in their relationship with the casemanager. Sometimes a simple introduction can evoke a defensive response from the family. Normalizing can enable an assessment to be more complete by minimizing the possibility of the family or individual becoming defensive and refusing to engage with the case manager. When a partnership is not established	 information is not being shared openly	 therefore obstructing the gathering information process (assessment). Normalizing a familys struggles can reduce the risk of defensive behavior by the family by attributing the familys problems to struggles associated with difficult life cycle stages.ProblemNormalizing LanguageFather who locked his teenage daughter in the basement to prevent her from leaving the house during the night while he sleeps.Teenagers today sometimes fail to understand the dangerous out in the world and the struggles to keep them away from harm. I found it so difficult when dealing with my teenage daughter	 particularly if I knew she washanging with the wrong crowd. You must feel horrible	 how did the evening start?A mother who has neglected her children due to drug use (previous sex abuse victim by the biological father).Single mothers say all the time how hard it is raising children alone; I can only imagine how difficult it is to focus on the constant demands of raising two children while simultaneously trying to overcome the abuse you sustained as a child. It must be so hard. Tell me when you noticed things were more than you could handle?A mother who (education) neglects her children.As a parent	 I found mornings extremely stressful. It took all I had to get the children up and out of the house to catch the school bus on time. I am sure it is especially difficult for you when your child makes up illnesses to avoid going to school and you do not have a car totransport him to school if he misses the. Tell me when this began.Foster mother spanks a child in foster care in her home. (policy violation assessment)A lot of foster parents have expressed how challenging it is to integrate a child into their home when the child may have come from a home with different rules or values. How did this all get started?Kinship caregiver who spanked a child in foster care that is placed in their home who is diagnosed ADHD.Kin who agree to be a placement resource for the child often experience problems adhering to the no spanking guidelines required by DFCS	 especially when they have cared for the child before the child went into foster care and was able to use physical discipline with the child. Tell what behaviors you were trying to deter?Adolescent in foster care who is experiencing problems adjusting to the school environment after being brought into foster care.I understand you are trying to focus on school	 but it is hard to focus after being removed from your family and placed into foster care. Teenagers have told me how difficult it is returning to school after being brought into foster care and everyone at school is aware of thesituation. Tell me about that.Adolescent in foster care who is having a problem establishing his career objectives for the creation of the WTLP.Teenagers often have trouble pinpointing their career path	 it seems so far off and not like a big deal at this age. Lets talk about it	 what things are you good at?Adoptive parents who are experiencing doubts about adopting a child.This is not uncommon	 several adoptive parents have expressed their apprehension to adopting a child following the adoptive placement	 you are not alone	 and adding a member to your family is a difficult process. Tell me about your concerns.A non-custodial parent who has a limited bond with the child wants to be a foster care kinship placement.Parents who do not live with their child and only see the child sporadically	 say it is very challenging to establish and maintain a bond with the child	 particularly when the relationship with the caregiver who is caring for the child each day is strained. Tell me about that.A non-custodial parent who has a limited interaction with the child wants to be a foster care kinship placement.I understand you were trying to get yourself financially established before engaging in your childs life because you wanted to have something to offer your child. Parents who are not involved in their childs life or have limited interactions with their child often say it is difficult to just show up when you have nothing tangible to offer. Tell me about this.Externalizing the Problem PatternExternalizing the problem allows the family or individual to detach themselves from their problem. The individual can now view the problem as something that is separate from their identity as a person. In short	 the person is not the problem	 the problem is the problem. Language that externalizes the problem can reduce criticism	 blame	 and guilt. If one of the family members has an anger problem	 externalizing the problem will free up the family to work on the problem rather than exhausting energy opposing each other or defending themselves. This opens up the opportunity for the SSCM to work together with the family as a team to address the problem. Externalizing the problem does mean minimizing the personal responsibility or shifting blameFor example	 asking the individual	 How long have you struggled with the problem of controlling your temper? Has the anxiety problem been around for a while? Can you see how anxiety has limited your family from engaging in fun activities? If your family wasnt plagued with the anxiety problem	 what kind of activities would your family enjoy? ProblemExternalizing LanguageMother who beats her child (prior abuse victim)Maybe you would like to put an end to this cycle of violence that has been passed on to you; would you liketo be one to defeat this monster and keep it from hurting future generations.Stepfather who slapped his teenage stepdaughterWhen you described those episodes when everybody gets into it and you end up losing it	 you seemed to be saying that you hate these episodes because they keepyou from being the father you really want to be to your stepdaughter.Mother who neglects her children due to depressionThis dark curtain that you mentioned	 tell me about a time when you fought back	 or slipped by	 or fooled thisdark curtain that descends on you.A mother who neglected her child due to drug use.When you said you vowed not to be like your mom and use drugs and not care for your children	 you seemed tobe saying the drug use keeps you from being the mother you really want to be to your children.  Engagement of the Noncustodial ParentEngagement of noncustodial parents is more than contacting them inquiring as to their interest in having involvement with the child (ren). It requires making an effort to understand their situation and why they may feel the way they do. It is important to be aware of certain dynamics that may come into play in this process. Their behavior may be in response to previous negative experiences they have had with the custodial parent	 preconceived notions about howthey are perceived by others regarding the status of their parental involvement	 or they may be reluctant because of their views about the child welfare system. Engagement of noncustodial parents can be facilitated by educating them on the process and exploring with them their possible role and how they can be a resource for the child (ren). The discussions with the custodial parent surrounding the involvement of the non-custodial parent need to occur during the development of the case plan. Engagement should revolve around the noncustodial parents presence/engagement in the childs life	 caregiving abilities	 cooperative parenting	 and emotional contributions to the child. A determination must be made about the non- custodial parent involvement with the child and their ability to contribute the outcomes of the case plan prior to establishing contact standards for the non-custodial parentObserving Parent/Guardian and Child InteractionDirect observation of parent and child interactions: What is the quality of the parent and child bonding? Does the parent engage the child in developmentally stimulating activities? Does the parent handle the child roughly or is there an apparent comfort level in providing for the child's needs? Does the parent identify the child's needs and respond to them in a nurturing way? Does the child seem fearful of the parent? Parent-child interaction in the parents home should be observed prior to reunification.Hearing and seeing how the parent and child communicate: Is communication verbal	 non- verbal	 physical	 positive	 negative	 passive	 more negative than positive?Determine if progress on the specified steps of the case plan are met: What changes in the parent's interaction with a child are observed since the previous meeting and/or the implementation of service provisions (i.e.	 counseling	 parenting skills training)? Is the parent learning and practicing better ways of parenting? Are they utilizing their action plan to avoid	 interrupt or escape situations that would usually lead to high-risk behaviors? Does the parent redirect the child when unwanted behaviors are noticed? If service provision is effective	 there should be evidence of enhanced parenting skills.These are only a few of the many insights that may be gained from direct observation of parent and child interactions. Using what is directly observed as a major component of case decision making is vital. A case decision based only on what is reported by the parent is never sufficient.Why to Make Contacts in the HomeIt is important to visit children in the home environment to assess safety and gain an understanding of the childs living conditions. It is recommended that contacts be made in the home as often as possible. There is helpful information that may be gathered when interacting with parents and children in their home environment and it is important to make firsthand observations of the home environment to which the child may be returning.Announced or Unannounced Home Visits2The nature of the reported allegations and the initial indication of the existence of a present danger situation or impending danger safety threat must be the first consideration when determining whether to make an announced or unannounced visit. If there is a present danger situation	 this requires an immediate response	 regardless of where the child is located. When a present danger situation is not apparent initially	 the nature of the allegations and DFCS history	 as well as the consideration of whether an interview could be tainted by an adult are important considerations when determining whether to do an announced or unannounced visit. Making an unannounced visit should be associated with timeliness	 immediacy	 or emergency situations. Unannounced visits are not discouraged when they are appropriate	 but they should be necessary and justified based upon the individual circumstances of the case and its history. Supervisory consultation and guidance are an integral part of the discussion when preparing to engage a family during CPS intervention. A family needs to know that CPS is not there to catch them doing something	 but to take action to protect a child. Therefore	 there needs to be a specific	 immediate	 and clearly observable reason that a case manager makes an unannounced visit.When a case manager is trying to build a partnership and consensus with a family	 he/ she must remember that courtesy and mutual respect is a core component of building effective and sustainable solutions to the difficult tasks or situations identified by a family. When possible	 a scheduled visit with a family can be an effective	 convenient	 and efficient process for all parties. The visit can be set to a time that is mutually convenient and include all household members. This alleviates the need to make multiple visits to complete interviews; saving time and effort for the case manager and caregiver(s)	 and also shows an effort to be courteous and respectful of the family and their time.Consideration for Additional Purposeful ContactsCircumstances which may warrant additional purposeful contacts include	 but are not limited to	 the following:Children are considered vulnerable because of age or disability.The safety plan is no longer sufficient.Progress is not being made on the safety plan or the family is in crisis.There are possible present danger situations or impending danger safety threats identified through contact with formal/informal providers or collaterals.Child Protective Services history with the family.Purposeful Contacts When the Caregiver or Child Resides in Another CountyCounty A may request County B to conduct a purposeful visit with a caregiver or child who is residing or temporarily living in County B if County A cannot conduct the visit. Both counties should have a discussion prior to the visit to address case plan goals	 the purpose of the visit and frequency of the visits. The assigned SSCM in County B should be added as a secondary SSCM in Georgia SHINES so that they may document the visit.Safe Sleeping Recommendations for Infants up to One Year of AgeCaregivers of infants (birth to 12 months old) must be informed of conditions that constitute a safe sleeping environment and that reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)	 also known as crib death. At minimum	 caregivers should be advised of the three primary safe sleep recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) commonly referred to as the ABCs of safe sleep:Alone  The babys sleep area should be close to	 but separate from	 where caregivers and others sleep. The sleeping area should be free of soft objects	 toys	 and loose bedding.Back  Infants should always be placed on their back to sleep for naps and at night.Crib  Place infants on a firm sleep surface	 such as on a safety approved crib mattress	 covered by a fitted sheet.Further additional information and guidance regarding safe sleeping and SIDS/SUIDS see Infant Safe to Sleep Guidelines and Protocol in Forms and Tools.Motor Vehicle Safety RecommendationsChildren are sensitive to heat as their body temperature can heat up three to five times faster than an adults. Children will die if their body temperature exceeds 107 degrees. Even at a temperature of 60 degrees outdoors	 the temperature inside a car can exceed 110 degrees. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) recommends the following precautions to take in order to avoid child heatstroke.Never leave a child unattended in a vehicle  even if the windows are partially open or the engine is running	 and the air conditioning is on;Make a habit of looking in the vehicle  front and back  before locking the door and walking away;Ask the childcare provider to call if the child does not show up for care as expected;Do things that serve as a reminder that a child is in the vehicle	 such as placing a phone	 purse	 or briefcase in the back seat to ensure no child is accidentally left in the vehicle or writing a note or using a stuffed animal placed in the driver's view to indicate a child is in the car seat;Always lock your vehicle when not in use and store keys out of a childs reach	 so children cannot enter unattended. Teach children that a vehicle is not a play area;A child in distress due to heat should be removed from the vehicle as quickly as possible and rapidly cooled. Documenting Purposeful ContactsAll visits must be documented on the Contact Detail page in Georgia SHINES within 72 hours of the contact. A narrative must be completed for each Contact Detail. At a minimum	 the documentation entry must include:The type of contact (e.g.	 face-to-face	 announced	 unannounced	 etc.).The date the contact occurred.Person(s) present at the visit.The purpose of the visit.What was discussed.Where the visit occurred.Whether the caregiver or child was interviewed privately. If the child was not interviewed privately document the reason(s) why this did not occur.Summary of information (What happened at the visit):The developmental stage of the family and the everyday life task in which the family is struggling;Sequencing of the event/situation that is causing concern;Safety	 permanency	 and well-being issues discussed;Consensus developed with the caregivers;Child and parents involvement in safety planning;Safety determination (safe or unsafe);Safety plan management; andChange that was noticed and celebrated with the caregiver(s).Observations of the home environment	 children for injuries or signs of maltreatment and interactions of family members.Any concerns or red flags identified.Next steps and the plan for addressing identified issues or concerns	 as well as documentation of issue resolution. FORMS AND TOOLSAuthorization for Release of Information Authorization for Release of Information (Spanish)Caregivers Guide to a Child Protective Services (CPS) Investigation Caregivers Guide to a Child Protective Services (CPS) Investigation (Spanish) Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children (CSEC) Referral FormHIPAA Notice of Privacy PracticesHIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices (Spanish)Human Trafficking Case Management Statewide Protocol Infant Safe to Sleep Guidelines and ProtocolIntimate Partner Violence (Domestic Violence) Guidelines & Protocol Notice of Case Record Information Available to Parents/GuardiansNotice of Case Record Information Available to Parents/Guardians (Spanish)""	https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-5-investigations-section-52-purposeful-contacts-during",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-5-investigations-section-52-purposeful-contacts-during

Contacts should be well planned and have a clear purpose. In order to thoroughly assess a childs safety, permanency and well-being, it is important to assess the functioning of the family that is caring for the child. Some key principles to keep in mind when performing purposeful contacts include:Recognizing the family providing care as a system - Each member of the family, including the child, has a role and responsibility within the family. If any one person is unable to fullfil their responsibilities, then the whole family is impacted.Engagement and partnership buidling - purposeful contacts are not only about engaging and building a relationship with the caregiver, but also about engaging and building a relationship with the entire family including absent parents.Involvement of families and youth - Because each member of a family has a role and responsibilities, it is essential to obtain input from all family members when assessing family functioning. When family members are engaged, this will re-affirm their importance in ensuring the success of the family system.Recognizing all members are individuals  Each family members will adjust differently to challenges to everyday life tasks. It is important to recognize the individuality of each family member and the impact DFCS involvement has on their lives.Cultural awareness - Each family has their own culture. Culture impacts family rituals and traditions. As family functioning is assessed, we must be respectful of all cultures involved and how they impact the functioning of the family.Empathy, authenticity and transparency - During purposeful contact with family, we should be mindful of these three words: empathy, authenticity and transparency. When engaging we must be able to identify with their thoughts and feelings even though we may not always agree. We also must be genuine and open in our communication with all family members and recognize that we have some accountability regarding the success or failure of the family. Purposeful contacts are also a time for the family to hold us accountable for what we may or may not be doing on behalf of the family who has joined in partnership with us.Remaining focused on safety, permanency and well-being throughout the process. Observing Children for Physical Signs of MaltreatmentObserving children for physical signs of maltreatment is an important part of ensuring child safety. To determine if there is cause to believe a child has been physically harmed, consider the following:Non-verbal cues from the child or the caregiver that raise concern.The age and special needs of the child. Young children and those with certain special needs are especially vulnerable and may not be able to verbalize when they are being abused or neglected. Therefore, the SSCM cannot depend on the child to say how they are feeling and must be keenly aware of non-verbal cues. For instance, if the child is wincing or drawing back slightly, it may be an indication of pain.Statements made by the child, other children/household members/collaterals, etc. that indicate him/her may have been subjected to physical harm or neglect, etc.Physical indicators of maltreatment such as suspicious injuries, marks, cuts, bruises, areas of swelling, protruding limbs, damaged skin, malnourishment, unexplained weight loss, lethargy, severe tooth decay, matted hair, pungent body odor, etc.The child resides with the caregiver or other individual that harmed the child or another child.The child indicates that physical discipline is being used; or that inappropriate methods of discipline is utilized by the caregiver or others in the home. The SSCM may need to view areas of a childs body that are covered by clothing to observe for signs of maltreatment and determine if the child needs medical treatment. This may require that the child (or caregiver for younger children) adjust their clothing. This can be embarrassing and anxiety provoking for the child. SSCMs must be sensitive to the childs level of comfort and make every effort to reduce their discomfort. This can be accomplished by having an adult present that the child knows and trusts, and by asking the child or the caregiver (for children four years and under or those with special needs) to adjust one area of a childs clothing at a time. Asking the child or the caregiver to raise a childs pant leg or shirt sleeve one at a time, is less invasive, while allowing the SSCM to observe for signs of maltreatment. The child should never be fully unclothed. When possible, arrange for a staff person of the same sex as the child to conduct the observation. Assessing InjuriesSome characteristics of injuries are considered red flags and warrant further scrutiny, these include but are not limited to:Injuries on children who are not mobile, especially infants.Injuries on protected surfaces of the body, such as the back and buttocks, ears, inside the mouth, the neck, arms or legs, and underarms.Multiple injuries in various stages of healing (i.e., skin injuries, lesions of varying ages, bruises).Patterned trauma, even if the object used to commit the abuse cannot be determined.Injuries that routine, age-appropriate supervision of the child should have prevented.Significant injury with either no explanation or an explanation that is not plausible.The SSCM may also need to observe the scene of the injury, to ascertain whether the caregiver and/or childs statement of what happened is plausible.Ask the caregiver and/or child to show him/her exactly what happened, and where.Note anything about the physical environment that refutes the statement(s) provided. For example, if the caregiver claims that the child fell out of bed and hit their head on the floor, causing a severe bruise, the SSCM should look at the bed, the floor, and height from the bed to the floor. Is the floor carpeted? Is it plausible that the injury occurred on the carpeted floor?Obtain a detailed, precise timeline of events surrounding the incident or track the sequence of events. The more detailed the history, the more likely the assessment of the injury will be accurate. This can be helpful when communicating with medical staff to determine if the injury could have been caused in the manner described by the caregiver and/or child.Deliberate Information Gathering (DIG)1Seek to understand the caregiver, his/ her point of view, story, and experience. That means to dig deeper for the information needed in order to understand the person, the situation and how these help explain both threats to child safety and caregiver protective capacities. The DIG idea is to be very deliberate in gathering information and seeking to understand while behaving very naturally. The following interpersonal techniques can be used while gathering information:Attending BehaviorAttending behavior refers to focusing attention on the caregiver rather than the SSCMs agenda or line of questioning. Attending behavior involves matching a caregivers  nonverbal behavior by consciously manipulating and controlling the SSCMs own nonverbal skills and responses. Primary attending behaviors include eye contact, facial expressions, body language, posturing and gesturing, following, reflecting and vocal qualities-tone and pace.Open QuestionsOpen questions help to remove the SSCM from the responsibility of carrying the interview by establishing a conversational quality to the interaction. Open questions cannot be answered yes or no or in just a few words. Open questions require the caregiver to elaborate with a wider range of responses. Open questions are the what and how type questions.Closed QuestionsClosed questions should be used to restrict or narrow the focus of a caregivers response. Closed questions should be used purposefully when precise detail and greater clarity is needed from the caregiver. As an exception, closed questions may be used more frequently when there are time constraints or when the SSCM is interviewing a caregiver ",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-4-initial-safety-assessment-isa-section-43-purposeful
GA :: Child Welfare Policy Manual :: Chapter 4 Initial Safety Assessment (ISA) :: Section 4.3 Purposeful Contacts During Initial Safety Assessments,Georgia,Rules,"2023, 2022, 2021","Administrative process, Expectations for care, Other, Visitation",,,"ho is very concrete or is not very verbal.ParaphrasingThe primary intent of paraphrasing is to facilitate the clarification of statements	 issues	 and concerns. Paraphrasing may involve the SSCM selecting and using a caregivers own keywords. Paraphrasing involves formulating the essential message that the caregiver is conveying and then stating that message back to the caregiver in the SSCMs own words. When paraphrasing	 check for accuracy of the statement by concluding the paraphrase with a simple question such as	 Is that correct? or Does that sound accurate?EncouragingThis technique serves to keep people talking about a particular topic	 issue	 or concern. Encouraging may be as simple as using a slight verbal prompt	 such as uh-huh	 I see	 go on	 or then what?Conversational LoopingConversational looping is a skill for gathering information that first involves the SSCM identifying some key general topic or area for discussion with a caregiver (e.g.	 approach to parenting	 problem-solving	 dealing with stress	 etc.). Once a topic has been identified	 begin the conversation with a broad non-threatening open question. As the conversation progresses related to the identified topic	 continue with a line of questioning (primarily open-ended) based on previous caregiver responses that progressively moves the discussion toward a more specific and intimate inquiry. A key to effective conversational looping is the ability of the interviewer to maintain a caregivers focus on a particular topic	 which will then enable the interviewer to gather more detailed information from the caregiver about the issue	 concern	 or topic inquiry.Example: Parenting ApproachSo	 how would you describe yourself as a parent? Where do you learn parenting skills from?What brings you the most satisfaction as a parent?How does what youre saying relate to your feelings about being a single parent? The content areas that are explored through conversational looping or for any technique are the six family functioning areas.Reflective Listening StatementsReflective listening statements involve the SSCMs attempts to interpret what a caregiver believes	 thinks and/or feels	 and then state the SSCMs interpretation back to the caregiver. The interpretation of what the caregiver is communicating is based on both verbal responses and nonverbal cues from the caregiver. A statement is used rather than a question because the statement is less likely to produce caregiver resistance	 and	 further	 a statement triggers the caregiver to re-examine the accuracy of his/her perceptions and thoughts. Example:Caregiver: I may have a couple of beers every once in a while	 with my friends	 but I dont have a drinking problem.SSCM: For you	 drinking is no big deal¦its just something you do socially with your friends? Separating Intentions from ActionsAn individual can experience differing even conflicting feelings about any given situation. It is not uncommon to have two thoughts on the same subject I would like to...	 but I am scared. Individuals who may have caused harm to a child also experiences these conflicting feelings. He deserved to be punished for not following the rules¦	 but I didnt mean to hurt him. He just would not stop crying	 I was exhausted and wanted to sleep¦.	 but I didnt mean to shake him that hard.Separating intentions from actions means joining in partnership with the part of the persons thoughts (intentions) related to not wanting this event to occur again	 while helping them to acknowledge their unacceptable actions. Two methods used to help separate intentions from actions are:Normalizing Family StrugglesNormalizing is a form of empathy (understanding) that acknowledges the familys problems is part of the struggle of negotiating difficult life cycle stages	 as well as strengths and efforts in coping with the problems. It also helps families learn that many others are in the same situation. It does not downplay or dismiss the problem. It also does not condone or endorse the harmful behavior.For example	 can you remember failing a test in college to only find out the majority of the class failed the test too? It does not remove the failing grade	 but deep down it does make you feel a little better that others are in the same situation. Sometimes knowing others failed too provides confirmation that the test was difficult.It is not unusual for families to start off defensively in their relationship with the case manager. Sometimes a simple introduction can evoke a defensive response from the family. Normalizing can enable an assessment to be more complete by minimizing the possibility of the family or individual becoming defensive and refusing to engage with the case manager. When a partnership is not established	 information is not being shared openly	 therefore obstructing the gathering information process (assessment). Normalizing a familys struggles can reduce the risk of defensive behavior by the family by attributing the familys problems to struggles associated with difficult life cycle stages.ProblemNormalizing LanguageFather who locked his teenage daughter in the basement to prevent her from leaving the house during the night while he sleeps.Teenagers today sometimes fail to understand the dangerous out in the world and the struggles to keep them away from harm. I found it so difficult when dealing with my teenage daughter	 particularly if I knew she washanging with the wrong crowd. You must feel horrible	 how did the evening start?A mother who has neglected her children due to drug use (previous sex abuse victim by the biological father).Single mothers say all the time how hard it is raising children alone; I can only imagine how difficult it is to focus on the constant demands of raising two children while simultaneously trying to overcome the abuse yousustained as a child. It must be so hard. Tell me when you noticed things were more than you could handle?A mother who (education) neglects her children.As a parent	 I found mornings extremely stressful. It took all I had to get the children up and out of the house to catch the school bus on time. I am sure it is especially difficult for you when your child makes up illnesses to avoid going to school and you do not have a car totransport him to school if he misses the. Tell me when this began.Foster mother spanks a child in foster care in her home. (policy violation assessment)A lot of foster parents have expressed how challenging it is to integrate a child into their home when the child mayhave come from a home with different rules or values. How did this all get started?Relative placement resource who spanked a child in foster care placed in their home who is diagnosed ADHD.Relatives who agree to be a placement resource for the child often experience problems adhering to the no spanking guidelines required by DFCS	 especially when they have cared for the child before the child went into foster care and was able to use physical discipline withthe child. Tell what behaviors you were trying to deter?Adolescent in foster care who is experiencing problems adjusting to the school environment after being brought into foster care.I understand you are trying to focus on school	 but it is hard to focus after being removed from your family and placed into foster care. Teenagers have told me how difficult it is returning to school after being brought intofoster care and everyone at school is aware of the situation. Tell me about that.Adolescent in foster care who is having a problem establishing his career objectives for the creation of the WTLP.Teenagers often have trouble pinpointing their careerpath	 it seems so far off and not like a big deal at this age. Lets talk about it	 what things are you good at?Adoptive parents who are experiencing doubts about adopting a child.This is not uncommon	 several adoptive parents have expressed their apprehension to adopting a child following the adoptive placement	 you are not alone	 and adding a member to your family is a difficult process. Tell me about your concerns.A non-custodial parent who has a limited bond with the child wants to be a relative placement. (Relative care assessment)Parents who do not live with their child and only see the child sporadically	 say it is very challenging to establish and maintain a bond with the child	 particularly when therelationship with the caregiver who is caring for the child each day is strained. Tell me about that.A non-custodial parent who has a limited interaction with the child wants to be a relative placement. (Relative care assessment)I understand you were trying to get yourself financially established before engaging in your childs life because you wanted to have something to offer your child.Parents who are not involved in their childs life or have limited interactions with their child often say it is difficult to just show up when you have nothing tangible to offer.Tell me about this.2. Externalizing the Problem PatternExternalizing the problem allows the family or individual to detach themselves from their problem. Externalizing the problem does not mean minimizing the personal responsibility or shifting blame	 rather	 it allows the individual to view the problem as something that is separate from their identity as a person. In short	 the person is not the problem	 the problem is the problem. Language that externalizes the problem can reduce criticism	 blame	 and guilt. If one of the family members has an anger problem	 externalizing the problem will free up the family to work on the problem rather than exhausting energy opposing each other or defending themselves. This opens up the opportunity for the SSCM to work with the family to address the problem.For example	 asking the individual	 How long have you struggled with the problem of controlling your temper? Has the anxiety problem been around for a while? Can you see how anxiety has limited your family from engaging in fun activities? If your family wasnt plagued with the anxiety problem	 what kind of activities would your family enjoy? ProblemExternalizing LanguageMother who beats her child (prior abuse victim)Maybe you would like to put an end to this cycle of violence that has been passed on to you; would you like to be one to defeat this monster and keep it from hurting future generations.Stepfather who slapped his teenage stepdaughterWhen you described those episodes when everybody gets into it and you end up losing it	 you seemed to be saying that you hate these episodes because they keepyou from being the father you really want to be to your stepdaughter.Mother who neglects her children due to depressionThis dark curtain that you mentioned	 tell me about a time when you fought back	 or slipped by	 or fooled thisdark curtain that descends on you.A mother who neglected her child due to drug use.When you said you vowed not to be like your mom and use drugs and not care for your children	 you seemed tobe saying the drug use keeps you from being the mother you really want to be to your children.  Engagement of the Noncustodial ParentEngagement of noncustodial parents is more than making contact with them inquiring as to their interest in having involvement with the child (ren). It requires making an effort to understand their situation and why they may feel the way they do. It is important to be aware of certain dynamics that may come into play in this process. Their behavior may be in response to previous negative experiences they have had with the custodial parent	 preconceived notions about how they are perceived by others regarding the status of their parental involvement	 or they may be reluctant because of their views about the child welfare system. Engagement of noncustodial parents can be facilitated by educating them on the process and exploring with them their possible role and how they can be a resource for the child (ren). The discussions with the custodial parent surrounding the involvement of the non-custodial parent need to occur during the development of the case plan. Engagement should revolve around the noncustodial parents presence/engagement in the childs life	 caregiving abilities	 cooperative parenting	 and emotional contributions to the child. A determination must be made about the non-custodial parent involvement with the child and their ability to contribute the outcomes of the case plan prior to establishing contact standards for the non-custodial parent. Observing Parent/Guardian and Child InteractionDirect observation of parent and child interactions: What is the quality of the parent and child bonding? Does the parent engage the child in developmentally stimulating activities? Does the parent handle the child roughly or is there an apparent comfort level in providing for the child's needs? Does the parent identify the child's needs and respond to them in a nurturing way? Does the child seem fearful of the parent? Parent-child interaction in the parents home should be observed prior to reunification.Hearing and seeing how the parent and child communicate: Is communication verbal	 non- verbal	 physical	 positive	 negative	 passive	 more negative than positive?Determine if progress on the specified steps of the case plan are met: What changes in the parent's interaction with a child are observed since the previous meeting and/or the implementation of service provisions (i.e.	 counseling	 parenting skills training)? Is the parent learning and practicing better ways of parenting? Are they utilizing their action plan to avoid	 interrupt or escape situations that would usually lead to high-risk behaviors? Does the parent redirect the child when unwanted behaviors are noticed? If service provision is effective	 there should be evidence of enhanced parenting skills.These are only a few of the many insights that may be gained from direct observation of parent and child interactions. Using what is directly observed as a major component of case decision making is vital. A case decision based only on what is reported by the parent is never sufficient.Why to Make Contacts in the HomeIt is important to visit children in the home environment to assess safety and gain an understanding of the childs living conditions. It is recommended that contacts be made in the home as often as possible. There is helpful information that may be gathered when interacting with parents and children in their home environment and it is important to make firsthand observations of the home environment to which the child may be returning.Announced or Unannounced Home Visits2The nature of the reported allegations and the initial indication of the existence of a present danger situation or impending danger safety threat must be the first consideration when determining whether to make an announced or unannounced visit. If there is a present danger situation	 this requires an immediate response	 regardless of where the child is located. When a present danger situation is not apparent initially	 the nature of the allegations and DFCS history	 as well as the consideration of whether an interview could be tainted by an adult are important considerations when determining whether to do an announced or unannounced visit. Making an unannounced visit should be associated with timeliness	 immediacy	 or emergency situations. Unannounced visits are not discouraged when they are appropriate	 but they should be necessary and justified based upon the individual circumstances of the case and its history.Supervisory consultation and guidance are an integral part of the discussion when preparing to engage a family during CPS intervention. A family needs to know that CPS is not there to catch them doing something	 but to take action to protect a child. Therefore	 there needs to be a specific	 immediate	 and clearly observable reason that a case manager makes an unannounced visit.When a case manager is trying to build a partnership and consensus with a family	 he/ she must remember that courtesy and mutual respect is a core component of building effective and sustainable solutions to the difficult tasks or situations identified by a family. When possible	 a scheduled visit with a family can be an effective	 convenient	 and efficient process for all parties. The visit can be set to a time that is mutually convenient and include all household members. This alleviates the need to make multiple visits to complete interviews; saving time and effort for the case manager and caregiver(s) and shows an effort to be courteous and respectful of the family and their time.Purposeful Contacts When the Caregiver or Child Resides in Another CountyCounty A may request County B to conduct a purposeful visit with a caregiver or child who is residing or temporarily living in County B if County A cannot conduct the visit. Both counties should have a discussion prior to the visit to address case plan goals	 the purpose of the visit and frequency of the visits. The assigned SSCM in County B should be added as a secondary SSCM in Georgia SHINES so that they may document the visit.Safe Sleeping Recommendations for Infants up to One Year of AgeCaregivers of infants (birth to 12 months old) must be informed of conditions that constitute a safe sleeping environment and that reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)	 also known as crib death. At minimum	 caregivers should be advised of the three primary safe sleep recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) commonly referred to as the ABCs of safe sleep:Alone  The babys sleep area should be close to	 but separate from	 where caregivers and others sleep. The sleeping area should be free of soft objects	 toys	 and loose bedding.Back  Infants should always be placed on their back to sleep for naps and at night.Crib  Place infants on a firm sleep surface	 such as on a safety approved crib mattress	 covered by a fitted sheet.Further additional information and guidance regarding safe sleeping and SIDS/SUIDS see Infant Safe to Sleep Guidelines and Protocol in Forms and Tools.Motor Vehicle Safety RecommendationsChildren are sensitive to heat as their body temperature can heat up three to five times faster than an adults. Children will die if their body temperature exceeds 107 degrees. Even at a temperature of 60 degrees outdoors	 the temperature inside a car can exceed 110 degrees. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) recommends the following precautions to take in order to avoid child heatstroke.Never leave a child unattended in a vehicle  even if the windows are partially open or the engine is running	 and the air conditioning is on;Make a habit of looking in the vehicle  front and back  before locking the door and walking away;Ask the childcare provider to call if the child does not show up for care as expected;Do things that serve as a reminder that a child is in the vehicle	 such as placing a phone	 purse	 or briefcase in the back seat to ensure no child is accidentally left in the vehicle or writing a note or using a stuffed animal placed in the driver's view to indicate a child is in the car seat;Always lock your vehicle when not in use and store keys out of a childs reach	 so children cannot enter unattended. Teach children that a vehicle is not a play area;A child in distress due to heat should be removed from the vehicle as quickly as possible and rapidly cooled.PicturesPictures are useful for documenting injuries and/or the condition of the home environment; and may be used as evidence in an investigation or in court.When taking pictures to document injuries	 ensure the following:The caregiver and the child are informed of the need for taking the pictures.Each photograph should have one identifier present (i.e.	 piece of the childs clothing)	 at least one photograph should include the childs face and the clothing	 to assure that the evidence collected demonstrates the series of pictures of the same child.Use measurable objects (i.e.	 ruler	 coin	 pencil) to depict the size of the injury. Photograph the object that caused the injury (whether the injury was accidental or not).When taking pictures of the condition of the home related to safety hazards to the children	 include all the areas that demonstrate a safety hazard	 such as inside and outside the home	 including the yard	 when applicable. NOTE: If the safety hazard is an infant unsafe sleep situation	 take a picture of the area in which the infant currently sleeps.All pictures should be identified with the following information: the individuals who took the photo	 the date it was taken	 name and date of birth of the alleged child victim	 and if applicable the address where the injury occurred or the home with the safety hazards. Documenting Purposeful ContactsAll visits must be documented on the Contact Detail page in Georgia SHINES within 72 hours of the contact. A narrative must be completed for each Contact Detail. At a minimum	 the documentation entry must include:The type of contact (e.g.	 face-to-face	 announced	 unannounced	 etc.).The date the contact occurred.Person(s) present at the visit.The purpose of the visit.What was discussed.Where the visit occurred.Whether the caregiver or child was interviewed privately. If the child was not interviewed privately document the reason(s) why this did not occur.Summary of information (What happened at the visit):The developmental stage of the family and the everyday life task in which the family is struggling;Sequencing of the event/situation that is causing concern;Safety	 permanency	 and well-being issues discussed;Consensus developed with the caregivers;Child and parents involvement in safety planning;Safety determination (safe or unsafe);Safety plan management; andChange that was noticed and celebrated with the caregiver(s).Observations of the home environment	 children for injuries or signs of maltreatment and interactions of family members.Any concerns or red flags identified.Next steps and the plan for addressing identified issues or concerns	 as well as documentation of issue resolution. FORMS AND TOOLSAuthorization for Release of Information Authorization for Release of Information (Spanish)A Caregiver's Guide to a Child Protective Services (CPS) InvestigationA Caregiver's Guide to a Child Protective Services (CPS) Investigation (Spanish) Notice of Case Record Information Available to Parents/GuardiansNotice of Case Record Information Available to Parents/Guardians (Spanish) Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children (CSEC) Referral FormHuman Trafficking Case Management Statewide Protocol Infant Safe to Sleep Guidelines and ProtocolIntimate Partner Violence (Domestic Violence) Guidelines & Protocol Notice of Privacy PracticesNotice of Privacy Practices (Spanish)""	https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-4-initial-safety-assessment-isa-section-43-purposeful",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-4-initial-safety-assessment-isa-section-43-purposeful

Ledbetter-Release of Information of Confidential RecordsPreventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act REQUIREMENTS The Division of Family and Children Services (DFCS) shall:Prepare for the Initial Safety Assessment (ISA) to direct and focus case management activities. Complete the ISA within 72 hours of the assigned response time: Conduct a private face-to-face purposeful contact with the alleged victim child(ren) within the response time to assess and address child safety. NOTE: When a new intake report is received and screened in on an active case, a new ISA must be initiated within the assigned response time. Take action when present or impending danger is identified. Begin an assessment of family functioning. Make a safety determination. Determine track assignment to Family Support Services (FSS) or Investigations. Adhere to Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and confidentiality provisions outlined in policies 2.5 Information Management: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and 2.6 Information Management: Confidentiality/Safeguarding Information. Keep the identity of the reporting source confidential (see policy 2.6 Information Management: Confidentiality/Safeguarding Information). Analyze DFCS history to ensure a thorough assessment of safety and family functioning. NOTE: If the analysis of DFCS history reveals that a previous ISA, FSS or Investigations was closed due to the family being unable to be located and the previous allegations were not assessed, assess both the previous and current allegations of maltreatment. Use court intervention and/or request support from law enforcement to interview or observe a child when prevented from doing so, and safety cannot be assured (see policy 17.1 Legal: The Juvenile Court Process). Engage each household member face-to-face and privately to discuss the maltreatment allegations and assess child safety and family functioning. This includes the following individuals: Alleged victim child(ren) Each parent All adult household members Other children in the home Alleged maltreater(s) NOTE: This includes alleged maltreaters identified as a person responsible for the care of a child, but do not reside in the home. In such instances, if the alleged maltreater does not have access to the child, the interview with him/her may be conducted upon track assignment. Inform the individual subject to a child abuse report (alleged maltreater) of the allegations made against him/her at the time of initial contact, whether face-to-face or by telephone. NOTE: The Social Services Case Manager (SSCM) must be certain he/she is speaking to the alleged maltreater. To protect the confidentiality of the family, if the identity of the alleged maltreater cannot be confirmed, do not discuss specific allegations. Conduct a visual assessment of all children to determine if any injuries or signs maltreatment exist. Observe the physical home environment, including every room in the home to determine if it is safe and appropriate to meet the needs of each child. Assess and discuss safe sleep practices with any parent who has an infant (up to one year of age) in the home. Take action to remedy unsafe sleeping situations prior to leaving the home (see Forms and Tools: Infant Safe to Sleep Guidelines and Protocol). Make a safety determination in consultation with the Social Services Supervisor (SSS) prior to concluding each purposeful contact with the child, parent custodian, adult household member, and/or alleged maltreater; and take immediate action to control the identified safety threats if the child is unsafe. Engage any child(ren) in the legal custody of the parent(s) in a face-to-face purposeful contact(s) who do not reside in the home concerning child safety and family functioning. Engage collateral contacts who can provide relevant information for assessing maltreatment allegations, child safety, and family functioning. Request state criminal history record information of adult household members when criminal history may impact child safety, in accordance with policy 19.8 Case Management: Criminal Records Checks. Afford all rights under the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) to any child who is a member of a federally recognized Indian Tribe, or eligible for membership and has a biological parent who is an enrolled member and is subject to removal, placement and/or any other legal action involving DFCS to promote the stability and security of Indian Tribes and their families (see policy 1.6 Administration: Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) and Transfer of Responsibility for Placement and Care to a Tribal Agency). Report to law enforcement immediately (no later than 24 hours) and refer the child to an available victim assistance organization, as certified by the Criminal Justice Coordinating Council when a child identifies as being a known or is a suspected victim of sex trafficking/sexual servitude.

At minimum, caregivers should be advised of the three primary safe sleep recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) commonly referred to as the ABCs of safe sleep: Alone  The babys sleep area should be close to, but separate from, where caregivers and others sleep. The sleeping area should be free of soft objects, toys, and loose bedding. Back  Infants should always be placed on their back to sleep for naps and at night. Crib  Place infants on a firm sleep surface, such as on a safety approved crib mattress, covered by a fitted sheet. For additional information and guidance regarding safe sleeping and SIDS/SUIDS see the Forms and Tools: Infant Safe to Sleep Guidelines and Protocol. FORMS AND TOOLSHuman Trafficking Case Management Statewide ProtocolInfant Safe to Sleep Guidelines and ProtocolIntimate Partner Violence (Domestic Violence) Guidelines & Protocol",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-4-initial-safety-assessment-isa-section-42-conducting

It can negatively affect the ways in which parents interact with and care for their children, which can increase the risk of maltreatment. Parental substance use or abuse may lead to difficulty with emotion regulation and decreased parental involvement and supervision. These negative parenting behaviors also place children at risk for medical and behavioral issues, serious injuries, and educational problems. For children in foster care, the parents use of illicit drugs has a significant negative impact on the length of time to permanency. Prenatal AbuseThe Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) includes provisions to address infants prenatally exposed to substances, requiring states to implement a Plan of Safe Care to address the infants well-being needs once identified as affected. In 2016, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) was signed into law reframing how states deal with prenatal exposure to substances. CARA requires infants exposed to any type of drug (legal or illegal) are assessed and provided services through a Plan of Safe Care. AffectedAn infant affected by prenatal exposure to substance use means:The infant is experiencing symptoms of withdrawal, or exhibiting harmful effects in his/her physical appearance or functioning due to exposure to substances (legal or illegal); orThe infant has tested positive for the presence of a substance or a metabolite thereof in his/her body, blood, urine or meconium; orThe infant has symptoms of a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder; orThe mother testing positive for illegal substances at the birth of the infant; orThe mother testing positive for prescription drugs due to misuse at the birth of the infant; orThe mother self-disclosed at the birth of the infant a substance or alcohol use problem and use during pregnancy. Controlled SubstanceA controlled substance is generally a drug or chemical whose manufacture, possession, or use is regulated by a government (federal or state law). This may include illegal drugs and prescription medications. Current Use of DrugsCurrent drug use means the illegal use of drugs occurred recently enough to justify a reasonable belief that a person's drug use is current. Examples of current use include a positivedrug screen or a newborn exhibiting withdrawal symptoms from the unlawful use of a controlled substance. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Disorder (FASD)FASD diagnostic conditions include:Type I: Fetal Alcohol Syndrome with confirmed maternal exposure.Type II: FAS without confirmed maternal exposure.Type III: Alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD).Type IV: Alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND). Symptoms of FASD can include facial abnormalities, growth deficiencies, skeletal deformities, organ deformities, central nervous system handicaps, and behavioral problems. These symptoms can have lifelong implications for children who were exposed to alcohol in the womb; however, some children with FASD who receive special education and adequate social services are more likely to reach their developmental and educational potential than those who do not receive those services.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-3-intake-section-34-intakes-involving-substance-use

A specific listing of ""Child Abuse and Neglect Reports"" under Department of Family and Children Services, listing the CPS Intake Communications Center contact number 1-855-GACHILD (1-855-422-4453); and ii. A separate alphabetical listing in the white pages, which reads ""Child Abuse and Neglect Reports"" and contains the CPS Intake Communications Center contact number 1-855-GACHILD (1-855-422-4453). 3. Receive intake reports via telephone, fax, other electronic submission (i.e., email, online form, etc.), mail, and in-person interviews. NOTE: Mail, faxes and other electronic submission that meet the three components of a report are considered as having received an intake report. The date and time the intake report is received via telephone, affixed on the fax/fax cover, the mail was received in the agency, or on the email shall be used as the intake report date. 4. Immediately contact the reporter to gather additional information when the intake report was received via telephone, fax, other electronic submission or when there is insufficient information to determine whether there is indication of child maltreatment. NOTE: Refrain from contacting anyone other than the reporter to obtain information regarding the Intake Assessment as it is viewed as initiating the Initial Safety Assessment (ISA). Additional individuals may only be contacted to determine the location of the alleged maltreated child or the family. 5. Engage the reporter to gather information to complete the Intake Assessment. 6. Follow a three-stage information collection process: Introduction, Exploration, and Closing when gathering information from the reporter for completion of the Intake Assessment. 7. Review the Intake Assessment to determine whether the allegation of maltreatment contains the following three required components: a. An alleged maltreater in a caregiving role. EXCEPTION: Reports alleging labor trafficking, sexual exploitation or sex trafficking do not require the alleged maltreated to be a caregiver. b. A child from birth to under the age of 18 and who is not an emancipated minor. c. Known or suspected allegations of child abuse per Georgia statute (O.C.G.A. §19- 7-5) and DFCS policy. 8.

Of the option to request notification of the disposition (substantiated or unsubstantiated) of an intake report assigned as an investigation. If the mandated reporter requests notification of the disposition, DFCS will provide a written notification within five calendar days of the conclusion of the investigation. c. If school personnel, that DFCS shall provide written notification within 24 hours of the receipt of an intake report to the school personnel who made the report. d. That DFCS shall provide written notification within five calendar days of completing the investigation to the school counselor from the school the child was attending at the time of the reported abuse, advising of the disposition (substantiated or unsubstantiated) of an intake report assigned as an investigation. If a school does not have a school counselor, this disclosure shall be made to the principal. 10. Immediately enter all intake reports into Georgia SHINES, but no later than the end of the shift in which the intake report was received. NOTE: Intake Assessments containing present danger situations shall be entered no later than two hours of the receipt of the intake report. 11. Thoroughly evaluate the Intake Assessment to make an intake decision in accordance with policy 3.2 Intake: Making an Intake Decision. 12. Immediately provide notification of all intake assessments that contain allegations of child abuse to the appropriate law enforcement agency or district attorney. In addition, if the parent/guardian of the alleged victim child is on active duty in the armed forces of the United States provide notification to the military law enforcement and Family Advocacy Programs. Include any pictures accompanying the intake report in the notification (see policy 3.25 Intake: Sharing Intake Reports with Law Enforcement, District Attorney or Military) PROCEDURES Intake Assessment Process The Centralized Intake Specialist will: Introduction: During this stage, set the tone for the call by initiating a dialogue with the reporter in a professional and courteous manner. a. Briefly explain the Intake Assessment process; b. Inform the reporter of the ability to make an anonymous report. When the reporter wishes to remain anonymous, the Intake Assessment process will continue; c. Explain confidentiality:     i. The reporter information will be kept confidential. However, the case record may be subpoenaed as a result of court proceedings and the reporter cannot be assured confidentiality will be fully protected; and     ii. It may be necessary for the reporter to appear in court, if court action is initiated to protect a child. d. Inform the reporter he/she is immune from liability when the report is made in good faith; e. Obtain the reporters name, telephone number and address, relationship to child(ren) and family, if applicable; f. Allow the reporter to begin sharing his/her concerns without interruption, if possible; and g. Respond with empathy to the reporter if he/she has emotional reactions to the information being shared and redirect the reporter when necessary to ensure pertinent information is gathered that is relevant to the familys functioning and potential maltreatment/safety issues. Exploration: During the exploration phase, assist the reporter by moving toward a more focused interview approach in order to fill in any gaps in information gathered during the Introduction stage.       a. Obtain the name, date of birth, address, and current location of all alleged victim children;        b. Obtain the name, date of birth, address, and current location of all caregivers and other household members (parents, grandparents, significant other, 3rd party caregivers, etc.). Attempt to gather the names and demographics on both mother and father regardless of where the child(ren) reside;        c. Ask the reporter if the child and/or parent/primary caregiver have, or is believed to have, American Indian heritage (see policy 1.6 Administration: Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) and Transfer of Responsibility for Placement and Care to a Tribal Agency);       d. Ask the reporter whether the parent/guardian of the alleged victim child(ren) is on active duty in the armed forces of the United States, and where he/she is stationed; and e.  Probe for additional information surrounding the allegations of child abuse, including when and how the maltreater abused the child, the harm/affect to the child, the likelihood of reoccurrence, and current safety of the child.Closing: During this final stage of the Intake Assessment, ensure that all essential information has been collected from the reporter. a. Confirm the following information gathered:      i. The reporters name, telephone number and address, relationship to child(ren) and family.     ii. The demographic information of the family (names, ages, relationship of household members, identification of caregiver(s) and address).    iii. Names of other persons including relatives who may have knowledge of the family.    iv. Location of the child(ren). b. Review the information ask clarifying questions. Identify and note all gaps in information.           i. Is there enough information to determine who is included in the family and where they are right now?           ii. Is there enough information about the children and any vulnerabilities?           iii. Is there enough information to determine how the caregiver and other family/household members function day-to-day? iv. Does the information (negative or positive) indicate the familys current situation, condition, or dynamics? v. Does the information indicate the presence of child maltreatment?          vi. Does the information indicate any threats to child safety? NOTE: Examples of information needing clarification would be statements such as a caregiver seems depressed, often drinks alcohol, or seems aggressive. These are vague descriptions that need a behavioral or observable context in order to qualify this information as a present danger or impending danger situation during the decision-making process.       c. Ask the if he/she has any additional information that he/she feels is important to share that may not have already been revealed;    d. Seek the reporters opinion regarding what he/she believes needs to happen in terms of intervention;    e. Obtain any information regarding worker safety; f. Inform the reporter of the next steps in the intake process;   g. If the reporter is a mandated reporter:        i. Ask if he/she would like notification (verbally or in writing) of the findings if the report is assigned as an investigation and document the mandated reporter response in the Additional Comments Section in Georgia SHINES. NOTE: Also see policy 3.24 Intake: Mandated Reporters for additional information to discuss with mandated reporters.      ii. If the mandated reporter is school personnel:          1. Obtain the name of the childs school, school counselor or principal and document this information in the Additional Comments section in Georgia SHINES.         2. Inform that DFCS will provide a written notice acknowledging receipt of the report of suspected child abuse via the Mandated Reporter Letter (see policy 3.24 Intake: Mandated Reporters).        3. Inform of the ability to obtain the status of an intake report assigned as an investigation, including whether the investigation is completed or ongoing.       4. Explain if the intake report was assigned as an investigation, DFCS will provide written notification within five calendar days of concluding the investigation to the school counselor of the school the child was attending at the time of the reported abuse, advising of the investigation disposition (substantiated or unsubstantiated). If a school does not have a school counselor, this disclosure will be made to the principal. h. Thank the reporter for contacting DFCS and end the call. Analyze the information gathered during the contact with the reporter: a. Begin to consider and establish CPS jurisdiction for the referral, acceptance for CPS intervention, and assignment based on allegations of maltreatment and the indication of a present or impending danger; EXCEPTION: Reports alleging labor trafficking, sexual exploitation or sex trafficking do not require the alleged maltreater to be a caregiver. b. Determine if the intake report contains the three required components for an allegation of child abuse; c. Thoroughly and clearly document the reported information in the narrative section of the Intake Assessment in Georgia SHINES using the reporters words; d. Conduct all required safety screenings, as outlined in policy 19.9 Case Management: Safety Screenings; e. Complete a thorough review and analysis of DFCS history and document in Georgia SHINES (see policy 19.10 Case Management: Analyzing DFCS History); f. Review the information reported to evaluate indicators of child maltreatment. Review the definitions of child abuse and select the category of child abuse and the corresponding maltreatment code(s) in Georgia SHINES based on the circumstances of the reported allegations; and g. Review the information reported to determine if there is any indication of present or impending danger (see policy 19.11 Case Management: Safety Assessment). Select the corresponding present or impending danger under each applicable Family Functioning Area. If the Intake Assessment is determined to contain a present danger situation:  i. Immediately staff the Intake Assessment with the Centralized Intake Specialist Supervisor to confirm the existence of a present danger situation. ii. If it is determined that a present danger situation exists, contact the County Department CPS jurisdiction by telephone and inform them of the need for an immediate response.Law Enforcement Requests for Immediate Assistance If law enforcement contacts the CICC requesting immediate assistance, the CICC will: Obtain the reason the officer requires DFCS assistance and his/her contact information. Immediately notify the County Department of law enforcements request.  Inform the officer that it may be necessary to contact him/her again to follow up if an Intake Assessment is necessary. NOTE: If the officer is unavailable, follow up with the County Department to provide the information needed, if applicable. County Department Receipt of Intake Reports  When intake reports are received by telephone, mail, fax or other electronic submission (i.e., email, online form, etc.) the County Department will immediately forward the correspondence to the CPS Intake Communication Center (CICC) at CPSIntake@dhs.ga.gov.  When a reporter calls the County Department to make a report, forward the reporter call to the CICC line 1-855-GACHILD (1-855-422-4453); however, the County Department may take the Intake Report and relay the information to the CICC.  When a reporter comes directly to the County Department to make a CPS report: a. Refer the reporting source to the CPS Intake Communication Center (CICC) line 1- 855-GACHILD (1-855-422-4453) to take the report while in the County Office; and b. If the reporter prefers to make the Intake Report face-to-face, the County Department will take the report and immediately relay the information to the CICC for entry into Georgia SHINES. NOTE: When the County Department is taking the Intake Report if available, utilize a threeway call with the CICC in order to participate in the information gathering process with the reporter. CICC Receipts of Intake Reports by Mail, Fax or Other Electronic Submission When an intake report is received via mail, fax or other electronic submission (i.e., email, online form, etc.) the Centralized Intake Specialist will:           1. Analyze the information contained in the correspondence to determine if the correspondence contains the three required components.         2. Contact the reporter by telephone to gather additional information.         3. Upload a copy of the report received and the email acknowledgement from electronic submission (acknowledgement that the reporter was notified of receipt of the report) to Georgia SHINES External Documentation. PRACTICE GUIDANCE Caregiver means any person providing a residence for a child or any person legally obligated to provide or secure adequate care for a child including his/her parent, guardian or legal custodian; person responsible for the care of a child; other adult that continually or at regular intervals live in the home; a foster parent; an employee of a public or private residential home, childcare institution, day- or childcare facility; school personnel. Primary caregiver: The person living in the household who assumes the most responsibility for childcare. Secondary caregiver: A parent or other person living in, or frequently in, the household who shares with the primary caregiver the routine responsibilities for childcare. A significant other residing in the home may be a secondary caregiver even though this person has limited childcare responsibility and may not have any legal relationship or obligation to do so. NOTE: Any person identified as a caregiver for a child should be entered as a principal in Georgia SHINES and all screenings completed and evaluated for any impact on child safety (see policy 19.9 Case Management: Safety Screenings). Person Responsible for the Care of a Child means: 1. An adult member of a childs household; 2. A person exercising supervision over a child for any part of the 24-hour day; or 3. Any adult who based on his or her relationship to the parent, guardian or legal custodian or a member of a childs household has access to such child. NOTE: Anyone designated as a person responsible for the care of a child should be entered as a principal in Georgia SHINES and screened in all systems for any history that could affect child safety (see policy 19.9 Case Management: Safety Screenings). Reports Involving Alleged Maltreaters who are not a Caregiver or Person Responsible for the Care of a Child If the allegations are regarding a maltreater who is not a caregiver or a person responsible for the care of a child, the report should not be automatically screened out without attempts to gather information about a caregivers knowledge, willingness, and ability to protect the child from the alleged maltreater. When a third party is identified as an alleged maltreater, attempts must be made to gather and analyze information regarding the caregivers knowledge of the alleged abuse or neglect and the caregivers level of protection of the child during the alleged abuse or neglect or afterwards. If it becomes apparent during the Intake Assessment that the childs caregiver was not negligent, nor involved in any form of abuse and the third party maltreater is not a caregiver of the child, then DFCS will screen out these Intake Assessments and refer the case to law enforcement. An exception to this rule is in reports alleging sexual exploitation or sex trafficking. Persons not considered third parties are: 1. Foster parents 2. Non-custodial parent living outside of the home 3. School or childcare personnel acting in a caregiver role Case Name Descriptors 1. Place in the name of the primary caregiver. 2. Place in the name of the minor parent when the minor parent is the primary caregiver for their child. 3. Place in the name of each primary caregiver or legal custodian when allegations of maltreatment are received regarding multiple families living in the same residence. 4. Place in the name of the caregiver from whom the child was removed when allegations of maltreatment are received that occurred prior to a child entering foster care. 5. Place in the name of each legal caregiver when it is determined the same alleged maltreater has abused or neglected multiple child victimsIntake Interview SkillsThe Intake Interview is predominately focused on information gathering and problem identification. The Centralized Intake Specialist is assisting the reporter to provide information and at the same time identifying and interpreting possible maltreatment, present danger situations, and impending danger safety threats. In order to gather the most information possible, the Centralized Intake Specialist must be able to use critical thinking skills to formulate logical questions based on the information the reporter is communicating. There are seven types of interviewing skills that can be used during an interview that will assist the Centralized Intake Specialist in gathering relevant information related to child maltreatment and the indication of present danger situations or impending danger safety threats. (See Intake Introduction Script) Open-Ended Questions: These questions allow the reporter to expand on a previous question or topic, and do not lend themselves to a ""yes"" or ""no"" answer. Example: What happened? Closed-Ended Questions: These questions are used to ask for specific information and can generally be answered with ""yes"" or ""no."" Example: Have you seen the child with bruises before.3. Reflective Listening: This technique essentially involves making a guess as to what the reporter means or is trying to communicate. The first step in reflective listening is to think reflectively. You do not necessarily know what people mean, so you have to reflect on what they must mean and make a reasonable guess. Reflective listening statements can be as simple as repeating a word or two in order to keep the reporter talking. It can be helpful to reflect how the reporter seems to be feeling as he or she speaks. Example: So what you are saying is you are angry, or You are frustrated because¦ 4. Suppressing and Refocusing: This technique is used to stop non-productive content or feeling in an interview and to redirect the reporter to more appropriate topics. This technique should be used very selectively and only when the interviewer is certain that the content is not relevant to the report. To use this technique, acknowledge what the reporter has said and then say, for example, ""I would like to talk with you now about what you actually saw happen to Susan. Tell me when you observed this. This skill is also helpful when a reporter is off topic, rambling, or repeating the same content. It is applied by redirecting the conversation to the topic that the interviewer wants to gather information on while acknowledging what the reporter has said. Example: I recall you saying that Mr. Simpson¦Now I would like you to tell me about the older child in the home. What was his name¦oh David¦ Tell me about him. 5. Probing: This skill is essential to collecting sufficient information and is applied by starting with open-ended questions. As the reporter provides information, the Centralized Intake Specialist will continue to move toward more detail with more closed ended questions, such as when, how often, when was the last time, etc. Example: Tell me about what happened. Tell me what you know about the family. What about Mom? Tell me about Dad. Does he seem to get angry often? How often have you noticed these angry outbursts? When was the first time? When did you most recently notice him being angry with the little boy? 6. Affirming: Affirming is done in the form of selective statements of appreciation and understanding. This technique helps to demonstrate empathy. Affirming can send the message that the Centralized Intake Specialist recognizes that the reporter has a perspective and understands what the reporters perspective is. Affirming is also used to send a message that the Centralized Intake Specialist acknowledges a reporters right to feel a certain way. Example: I understand that it must be frustrating for you when you feel like you are not being heard. 7. Summarizing: This skill can be used to change topics with a reporter or to wrap up the call during the closing phase. The Centralized Intake Specialist will connect and draw conclusions regarding material and information that was discussed and reinforces what was said during the call. This technique will enable the Centralized Intake Specialist to prepare the reporter to move along to another topic or to close out the call. The Centralized Intake Specialist should offer an overall summary at the end of the call, including any step(s) the reporter agreed to take (i.e., contact collaterals, advise the family of a service, etc.). Example: So, Ms. X, you have called today to express concern about Jimmy not receiving enough food due to Mom having insufficient income. Jimmy is in generally good health. We agreed that you would take Mom to Little Sisters Food Center to show her how to access food there. You also offered to take her there whenever she may need to go.  Intake Reports Across County Lines When allegations of child abuse are reported regarding a child in County A and it is determined the child is a resident of County B, County A must notify County B of the intake report and both counties will coordinate case management activities including identifying which County will have the responsibility to make the face-to-face contact with the child to ensure child safety. When an immediate response is deemed necessary, County A will be responsible for making face-to-face contact with the child in order to assess safety. Some examples are: Intake report received from law enforcement in County A, requesting an immediate response to a home or the allegations indicate an immediate response is needed. The address given for the children indicate they are residents of County B and are visiting in County A. County A should provide the immediate response. Intake report received from law enforcement in County A indicates the children are being taken into protective custody and need to be placed into foster care in County A. The legal residence of the children is County B. County A should complete the immediate case management activities that are required, including the assessment for child safety. Both counties should coordinate all other activities. County B should make every effort to attend the preliminary protective hearing in County A. A transfer of court jurisdiction should occur to County B. When allegations of child abuse are reported regarding a child whose primary caretaker is in jail/prison, the intake report will be assigned to the County Department of the primary caregivers legal residence prior to their incarceration, regardless of the location of the child(ren). When allegations of child abuse are reported regarding a child in a hospital in County A and it is determined that the primary caretaker resides in County B, the intake report shall be assigned to County B where the primary caregiver resides. NOTE: When it is determined that an intake report made to County A should have been made to County B, reassign the Intake Assessment in Georgia SHINES to County B immediately. County A should notify County B by telephone when this circumstance exists. Use of email may be appropriate; however, it is the responsibility of County A to ensure that County B is aware of the Intake Assessment assignment. The reassignment of the Intake Assessment in Georgia SHINES does not change the original response time assigned to ensure child safety Intake Reports Opened in Error If a user accidentally opens an intake report in Georgia SHINES and the Centralized Intake Specialist has not selected alleged victims, allegations, disposition, or safety threats, then the intake may be marked as opened in error and closed.Reports of Juvenile Drug Use Persons that have reasonable cause to believe that a child is habitually using, in an unlawful manner, any controlled substance or marijuana, as defined by Georgia law is encouraged to report such information to the childs caregiver and to DFCS. If the person exercising loco parentis control over the child is a member of any school, social agency or similar facility, the person in charge shall make the report. DFCS shall receive the information as an intake report then subsequently Screen Out and Refer to Juvenile Court if there are no allegations that accompany the report of juvenile drug use that are indicative of child abuse by the caregiver. Child Abduction Response Team (CART) The CART is a multi-disciplinary team authorized to investigate the abduction or endangerment of children in Georgia and is only activated upon the request of a sheriff, police chief, the attorney general, the district attorney, or designee of any of the aforementioned. CART pulls resources together allowing for a rapid and organized response to missing children. A family involved in a CART may not necessarily come to the attention of the local DFCS office or require DFCS intervention. A DFCS state office representative serves as the CART liaison who will provide DFCS information to the CART. The DFCS state office representative may contact any local DFCS County office to obtain information about the family involved in a CART and may request the support of county staff. When directed by the DFCS state office representative, CICC should enter an intake report in Georgia SHINES noting a CART has been activated and specifying who directed the initiation of the CART intake report. If the County Department is directly contacted concerning a CART and DFCS intervention is required, the County Department will contact the CICC to relay intake report information. Rights and Duties of Legal Custodian A legal custodian is a person who has been given legal custody of a child by order of a court; or may be classified as a public or private agency, or other private organization licensed or otherwise authorized by law to receive and provide care for a child. The legal custodian has the right to physical custody of a child, the right to determine the nature of the care and treatment of such child, including ordinary medical care and the right and duty to provide for the care, protection, training and education and the physical, mental and moral welfare of such child, subject to the conditions and limitations of the order and to the remaining rights and duties of such childs parent or guardian. Categories of Child Abuse Physical injury/Physical abuse Neglect Emotional abuse Sexual abuse or Sexual exploitation Prenatal abuse of a child by a parent An act or failure to act that presents an imminent risk of serious harm to the childs physical, mental, or emotional health Page 11 of 11 3.1 Receiving Intake Reports Trafficking a child for labor servitude (labor trafficking) For additional guidance and the definitions of the categories of child abuse see Forms and Tools: Maltreatment Codes.  FORMS AND TOOLS Areas of Family Functioning ToolIntake Introduction ScriptLack of Supervision Reference Guide Maltreatment Codes ",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-3-intake-section-31-receiving-intake-reports

NOTE: The County Director is responsible for informing the Regional Director of the receipt of the open records request. The DFCS Office of General Counsel will handle the response to the request including, as applicable, the following: Preparing records; Estimating applicable charges/fees; and Communicating with the requestor. PRACTICE GUIDANCE Georgia Open Records Act (ORA) The General Assembly of Georgia has declared its legislative intent of the ORA to align with public policy in favor of open government. Open government is essential to a free, open, and democratic society; and public access to public records should be encouraged to foster confidence in government so that the public can evaluate the expenditure of public funds and the efficient and proper functioning of its institutions. The General Assembly further finds and declares that there is a strong presumption that public records should be made available for public inspection without delay. The ORA should be broadly construed to allow the inspection of governmental records. No public officer or agency shall be required to prepare new reports, summaries, or compilations not in existence at the time of the request. Open Records Officer The Department of Human Services will work diligently in fulfilling requests for documents in accordance with the Open Records Act. As authorized by O.C.G.A. § 50-18-71 (b) (2), the Department has designated an Open Records Officer. Official requests for records under the Open Records Act must be made directly to the Open Records Officer. Official Open Record Requests can be emailed to the Open Records Officer at: openrecordsdhs@dhs.ga.gov. Open Records Requests can also be mailed or faxed to the Open Records Officer at: Office of General Counsel 2 Peachtree Street, N.W., 29-202 Atlanta, Georgia 30303 Fax: (404) 657-1123 Public Record Definition All documents, papers, letters, maps, books, tapes, photographs, computer based or generated information, data, data fields, or similar material prepared and maintained or received by an agency or by a private person or entity in the performance of a service or function for or on behalf of an agency or when such documents have been transferred to a 2.9 Open Records Act of Georgia private person or entity by an agency for storage or future governmental use. Near Fatality Definition The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) defines near fatality, as an act that places a child in serious or critical condition as certified by a physician. Applicable Charges for ORA Request An agency may impose a reasonable charge for the search, retrieval, redaction, and production or copying costs for the production of records. An agency may charge a fee for the copying of records or data, not to exceed 10 cent(s) per page for letter or legal size documents or, in the case of other documents, the actual cost of producing the copy. In the case of electronic records, the agency may charge the actual cost of the media on which the records or data are produced. Response to ORA Request In any instance in which an agency is required to or has decided to withhold all or part of a requested record, the agency shall notify the requester of the specific legal authority exempting the requested record or records from disclosure by Code section, subsection, and paragraph within a reasonable amount of time not to exceed three business days or in the event the search and retrieval of records is delayed, then no later than three business days after the records have been retrieved. In any instance in which an agency will seek costs in excess of $25.00 for responding to a request, the agency shall notify the requester within a reasonable amount of time not to exceed three business days and inform the requester of the estimate of the costs, and the agency may defer search and retrieval of the records until the requester agrees to pay the estimated costs unless the requester has stated in his or her request a willingness to pay an amount that exceeds the search and retrieval costs.

At the initiation of every case, DFCS staff explains to individuals being served the protections their information is provided and any anticipated disclosures that may be required by law. ¯It is vital that¯DFCS¯adhere to confidentiality standards established by law as families place their confidence and trust in¯child welfare staff.¯Families deserve the respect and personal autonomy fostered by preserving confidence and personal privacy. Tips for protecting confidential client information:Only access the minimum amount of case information needed to carry out your job responsibilities. When requesting services, staff shall release only the information that is required by law or needed to arrange for services or to fulfill administrative requirements. If confidential material is mailed, it should be sent ""certified"" and ""registered. When copies of client information are used for ad hoc consultation (e.g., staffing, case reviews, case conferencing, or education planning) and are not needed for the permanent file of the consultant, case management staff are expected to retrieve the copies and destroy them. Properly dispose of confidential information through shredding. Ensure confidential information on your computer is secure. For example, lock the computer before you step away, block the computer screen from the view of passersby, protect your passwords, etc. Keep paper files in locked file cabinets with the key in a separate secure location. Discussions that include confidential client information should be held in locations such as an office or conference room to prevent passers-by from hearing confidential information. Family Meetings and Confidentiality DFCS uses family meetings (i.e. FTM, Transition Roundtable, informal family meetings) to bring together family members and other family supports, including kin, friends, members of the familys faith community and professionals who in partnership create, modify and implement case plans/action plans, or make critical decisions regarding child safety, permanency, and well-being. Bringing a family together with a solution focused team of supports contributes to a variety of potential benefits but may also create a scenario where confidential information is discussed. Prior to the convening of a family meeting, the SSCM must explain to¯parents/guardians/legal custodians:Their privacy rights They are not required to share their private information with anyone including family members Releasing¯private¯information verbally¯or¯in writing is their choice They can provide consent through the signing of ROICase Record O.C.G.A. §49-5-40(a)(9) defines ""record"" as including documents, books, maps, drawings, computer based or generated information, data, data fields, digital images, photographs, video images, audio recordings, and video recordings. Certain items within the case record may not be shared when the individual or agency who is making the request does not need the information contained in such records to carry out its legal responsibilities to protect children from child abuse and neglect. The safety of the children, reporters, and other individuals mentioned in these documents must be considered when providing access to records. These include: names (children, reporters, individuals who were interviewed or provided information, etc.); social security numbers, dates of birth; addresses; phone numbers; information about a child who is not the subject of the report; medical, mental health, and substance abuse information that does not specifically relate to findings of abuse or neglect; and Information provided by law enforcement.Releasing Information in a Manner that Preserves Confidentiality When releasing confidential information, as permitted by law, to specified individuals or entities certain protections must be in place to prevent further disclosure of the information. Reasonable and appropriate security measures should be established to protect confidential information. When it is necessary to convey sensitive or confidential information, that information must be sent via a secure encrypted email. This information may include any information pertaining to a child welfare case of a current or former client, inclusive of investigative and health information, regardless of whether the information is stripped of identifying details or is otherwise considered confidential pursuant to law. DFCS as a covered entity, must implement technical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to electronic protected health information (ePHI) that is being transmitted over an electronic communications network. Specifically, the encryption of ePHI during transmission over electronic communications networks with business associates should be used, when possible, to avoid access by unauthorized entities. Local offices have the flexibility to determine when, with whom, and what method of encryption to use. (See the DHS Encrypt Sending and Recipient Instructions in Forms and Tools).Grand Jury A panel of citizens that is convened by a court to decide whether it is appropriate for the government to indict (proceed with a prosecution against) someone suspected of a crime. Subpoena An order from the court requiring the production of documents or requiring a person to appear in court. Child Abuse Protocol Committee A multidisciplinary, multiagency committee established for each county to define standard procedures and practice for responding to child abuse and neglect. The purpose of the Child Abuse Protocol is to ensure cooperation between all agencies involved in a child abuse case. This coordination increases agency efficiency and minimizes trauma for the allegedly abused child by the legal and investigatory process. In addition, it ensures that treatment is provided for the child, the family, and the perpetrator (see policy 1.15 Administration: Child Abuse Protocol).FORMS AND TOOLS Authorization for Release of InformationAuthorization for Release of Information (Spanish)DHS Encrypt Recipient InstructionsDHS Encrypt Sender InstructionsGuide for Secure Information SharingGuide for Secure Information Sharing with the Military",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-2-information-management-section-26

Human trafficking is most commonly for the purpose of sex trafficking or sexual servitude, forced labor or for the extraction of organs or tissues, including surrogacy. It is a serious public health problem that negatively affects the well-being of individuals, families, and communities. Human trafficking occurs when a trafficker exploits an individual with force, fraud, or coercion to make them perform commercial sex or work. This type of violence exploits women, men, and children across the United States and around the world. Perpetrators of human trafficking often target people who are poor, vulnerable, living in an unsafe situation, or searching for a better life. Many victims are women and girls, though men and boys are also impacted. Victims can come from all backgrounds, races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, gender identities, citizens, non-citizens, and income levels. Victims can become trapped in different locations and situations, and do not have to be physically transported between locations to be victimized. Victims are often controlled through assault, threats, false promises, perceived sense of protection, isolation, shaming, and debt. Youth who are victims of sex trafficking are often seduced, coerced or forced into trafficking. For example, youth with a history of abuse and neglect or who are homeless are more likely to be exploited. Traffickers will identify a youth's vulnerabilities and prey upon their normal desires for love, attention, or material items, and the meeting of basic needs, such as shelter or food. Many victims of sex trafficking do not see themselves as victims and will make efforts to protect their abuser. Victims of sex trafficking may have suffered significant psychological, physical and sexual abuse and may exhibit anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress syndrome. Consequences of sexual violence, including sex trafficking, can be immediate and long term, including physical and relationship problems, psychological concerns, and chronic health outcomes. FORMS AND TOOLS Human Trafficking Case Management Statewide Protocol",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-1-administration-section-113-sex-trafficking-overview

The review will include a recommendation if any changes should be made.  Submit the recommendation from the review to the DFCS Division Director by June 30th for consideration. The DFCS Division Director will:  Review any recommendation for change(s) and decide whether to accept the recommendation. Decide if the recommended change(s) will be included in the DFCS budget request submitted to the Governor for the subsequent State Fiscal Year. NOTE: Any changes to the foster care maintenance and adoption assistance payment amounts require the approval of the Governor and the State Legislature. Review of Approval Standards The Placement and Permanency Section will: Conduct a review of the existing approval standards for CCIs and family foster homes to assess their continued appropriateness. a. The review will occur at minimum every two years in even numbered years. b. The review will include a recommendation of any changes to be made. Conduct periodic reviews of approval standards through processes established by: a. The Office of Provider Management for CCIs and child placing agencies (CPAs). The review includes consultation with key stakeholders (e.g. Office of the Child Advocate, Residential Child Care Licensing, Department of Juvenile Justice); b. The Caregiver Recruitment and Retention Unit (CRRU) for Foster Family Homes. The review includes Resource Development staff and other partners. Submit any proposed changes to the approval standards to the DFCS Division Director for approval. Collaborate with the Policy and Regulations Unit to incorporate the approved change(s) into the Child Welfare Policy Manual (CWPM). The Division Director will: Review any recommendation for change(s) to the approval standards and decide whether to accept the recommendation. Approve any resulting changes to the CWPM.  PRACTICE GUIDANCE Safety and Quality Standards Any changes to approval standards must adhere to title IV-E of the Social Security Act provisions for safety and quality standards (see policies 14.1 Resource Development: Safety and Quality Standards and 16.8 Room Board Watchful Oversight: Minimum Standards). The purpose of safety and quality standards is to ensure caregivers have the capacity to care for a child in foster care, and to ensure the physical home of the caregivers is appropriate and safe for the child. Office of Provider Management (OPM) The OPM contracts with and monitors the Child Care Institutions and Child Placing Agencies provisions of Room, Board, Watchful Oversight (RBWO) services. OPM employs various mechanisms to monitor providers adherence to RBWO Minimum Standards and contractual obligations (e.g. data, on-site and records reviews, and collateral reports) which direct performance expectations regarding the safety, permanency, and well-being of children. The foundational objective of OPM is to ensure that children placed in RBWO care are safe from abuse. OPM also provides training and technical assistance to providers to support their ability to meet quality of care and performance expectations. OPM partners with stakeholders in the review of the RBWO Minimum Standards to ensure they continue to meet safety and quality standards as outlined in policy 14.1 Resource Development: Safety and Quality Standards. Caregiver Recruitment and Retention Unit (CRRU) The CRRU is charged with the recruitment, development, supervision, support, and retention of temporary caregivers and adoptive parents for children in foster care and youth age 18 and older in Extended Youth Support Services. CRRU partners with CPAs, CCIs, and other interested community stakeholders to expand its number of available placement resources. The recruitment of foster and adoptive parents is a collaborative public, private, and community-based effort aimed at maximizing the number and type of placement resources available to children and youth in need. CRRU also provides pre-adoption services and assist with the matching of Georgias waiting children with approved adopted families. CRRU helps ensure that children and youth are placed in the least restrictive and most appropriate placement. The CRRU periodically reviews foster family home approval standards to ensure their continued appropriateness and compliance with state and federal law and best practice. FORMS AND TOOLS N/A ",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-1-administration-section-112-review-payments-and

Program improvement plans developed as a result of a full or partial child and family services review;  Ensure plans are updated as required; and  Inform stakeholders of the accessibility of the documents.PRACTICE GUIDANCE Child and Family Services Plan (CFSP) The CFSP is a five-year strategic plan that sets forth the vision and the goals to be accomplished to strengthen the states' overall child welfare system. Annual Progress and Services Reports (APSR) The APSR provides annual updates on the progress made toward accomplishing the goals and objectives in the CFSP. Completion of the APSR satisfies the federal regulations by providing updates on a state's annual progress for the previous fiscal year and planned activities for the upcoming fiscal year. Title IV-E State Plan Under section 471(a) of the Social Security Act, as a condition of receiving title IV-E funding, states, territories, and tribes must have a title IV-E plan that is approved by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Administration for Children and Families (ACF). The title IV-E plan is a single document that applies to all three title IV-E program components (foster care, adoption, and kinship guardianship). The title IV-E plan ensures direct financial assistance is made available to eligible children under the title IV-E program. Further, it ensures that the state will adhere to federal plan requirements primarily intended to ensure childrens safety, permanence, and well-being, and shall be in effect and mandatory in all political subdivisions of the State. A title IV-E plan must be submitted to ACF using a ""pre-print"". The ""pre-print"" is a form that lists title IV-E provisions and provides a space for the title IV-E agency to fill in the relevant law, regulation, or policy indicating compliance with the given provision. Once the state plan has been submitted to HHS and approved, it remains in effect until amendments are required. An amendment is required if there is any significant and relevant change in the information or assurances in the plan, or the organization, policies or operations described in the plan (see policy 1.7 Administration: Monitoring, Reviews, Reporting and Independent Audits). Child and Family Services Review (CFSR)The CFSR is a federal-state collaborative effort designed to help ensure that quality services are provided to children and families through state child welfare systems. They are reviews of state child welfare programs and practice that identify strengths and challenges in state programs and systems, focusing on outcomes for children and families in the areas of safety, permanency, and well-being. The process addresses each systemic factor under review including the statewide/Tribal information system; case review system; quality assurance system; staff training; service array; agency responsiveness to the community; and foster and adoptive parent licensing, recruitment and retention. Reviews also address the outcome areas of safety, permanence, and well-being of children and families served by DFCS using data from AFCARS and NCANDS. State/Tribal agencies found not to be operating in substantial conformity shall develop a program improvement plan. Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) Plan CAPTA provides funds for states to improve their child protective systems. To be eligible to receive these funds, a state must submit a plan including certain assurances related to how it will operate its CPS system; establish and support citizen review panels; and, to the ""maximum extent practicable,"" annually supply to certain child abuse and neglect data to the Department Page 3 of 3 Public Review and Inspection of Child and Family Services Review Materials and Federal Plans of Health and Human Services (HHS). States must also perform a range of prevention activities, including addressing the needs of infants born with prenatal drug exposure, referring children not at risk of imminent harm to community services, implementing criminal record checks for prospective foster and adoptive parents and other adults in their homes, training child protective service workers, protecting the legal rights of families and alleged perpetrators, and supporting citizen review panels. Once approved by the Childrens Bureau, a states CAPTA Plan remains in effect for the duration of the states participation in the CAPTA Development and Operation grant program, but must be periodically reviewed and revised as necessary by the state to reflect changes in the states strategies and programs. Program Improvement Plans (PIP) States prepare a Program Improvement Plan to develop or enhance policies, training, and practice identified as needing improvement to increase positive outcomes for children and families. The plan must address any outcome domains or systemic factors that are not in substantial conformity and their associated items. FORMS AND TOOLS Georgia Child Welfare Federal Reviews and Plans",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-1-administration-section-19-public-review-and

ICWA established standards, as well as a protocol, for providing child welfare services to assure that agencies meet the cultural needs of Indian children requiring out-ofhome placement and to protect the continued existence and integrity of Indian Tribes. ICWA seeks to protect the rights of the Indian child as an Indian and the rights of the Indian community and Tribe in retaining its children in its society. It gives the Indian childs parents or Indian custodian and their Tribe the right to intervene or request transfer to their tribal court of any proceedings involving out-of-home placement or termination of parental rights of an Indian child.If the child is a member of, or eligible for membership in, a federally recognized Indian Tribe, the family, the Indian custodian, and the Tribe have rights under ICWA. These rights apply to any child protection case, adoption, guardianship, termination of parental rights action, runaway, or truancy matter involving the placement of an Indian child (including foster care placements, termination of parental rights, pre-adoptive placements, adoptive placements, both voluntary and involuntary placements, transfers of placement and placements due to failed adoptions.)Foster care placement means any action removing an Indian child from the parent or Indian custodian for temporary placement in a foster home or institution or in the home of a guardian or conservator where the parent or Indian custodian cannot have the child returned upon demand, but where parental rights have not been terminated; Termination of parental rights means any action that may result in the termination of the parent-child relationship; Pre-adoptive placement means the temporary placement of an Indian child in a foster home or institution after the termination of parental rights, but prior to or in lieu of an adoptive placement; and Adoptive placement means the permanent placement of an Indian child for adoption, including any action resulting in a final decree of adoption.Locating Information on Federally Recognized Tribes As of February 2020, there are 574 federally recognized Indian Tribes. No federally recognized Tribes are located in Georgia. Tribes are continually applying for federal recognition, so the number of approved tribes may increase over time. It is important for staff to exercise due diligence in researching tribes, as their recognition status may have changed. The federal Bureau of Indian Affairs (www.bia.gov) provides information on federally recognized tribes and their contact information. Visit the BIA website and search the Quick Links for resources related to the ICWA, and the Complete List of Federally Recognized Tribes.Children Belonging to a Federally Recognized Tribe If a child residing in Georgia belongs to one of the federally recognized Tribes, it is important to comply with ICWA from the earliest stages of a child welfare proceeding. The SSCM must address the following requirements in ICWA:Notification to childs parents, guardian (or Indian custodian), and the Tribe regarding State proceedings involving the child and their right to intervene; Notification to the Court that the child may belong to a federally recognized Tribe; Special placement preferences for Indian children; Active efforts to prevent the breakup of the Indian family; and Use of tribal courts in child welfare matters (the Tribe has a right to intervene in State proceedings or transfer the proceeding to the jurisdiction of the Tribe).Emergency Removal of a Child Nothing in the ICWA shall be construed to prevent the emergency removal of an Indian child to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the child. The emergency removal or placement shall terminate immediately when it is no longer necessary to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the child and cannot last more than 30 days unless the court makes certain determinations. The SSCM must proceed expeditiously with child custody proceedings, transfer the child to the jurisdiction of the appropriate Indian Tribe, or return the child to the parent(s) or Indian custodian, as appropriate.Indian Indian is a term used in United States federal language, including the Indian Child Welfare Act, to refer to any person who is a member of a federally recognized American Indian Tribe or Alaska Native Village, or who is an Alaska Native and a member of a Regional Corporation.Indian Child Any unmarried person who is under age 18 and is determined by the Tribe, Bureau of Indian Affairs, or Department of the Interior, to be:A member or eligible for membership of an Indian Tribe as determined by the Tribe and/or Nation, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), or the Department of the Interior; or Eligible for membership in an Indian Tribe as determined by the Tribe and the biological child of a member of an Indian Tribe.Indian Custodian Any Indian who has legal custody of an Indian child under applicable Tribal law or custom or under applicable State law, or to whom temporary physical care, custody, and control has been transferred by the parent of such child. An Indian may demonstrate that he or she is an Indian custodian by looking to Tribal law, Tribal custom or State law.Tribal Membership What constitutes membership in a Tribe varies from Tribe to Tribe, and final determination of membership lies solely with the Tribe. Tribal membership is not an arbitrary label assigned at the discretion of the parent. If an Indian child who is a member or eligible for membership in more than one Tribe, the Indian Tribe with which the Indian child has the more significant contacts and connection shall be the childs Tribe.Evidentiary Standards Clear and convincing evidence: To prove a foster care placement is necessary for an Indian child, the SSCM must show enough convincing evidence that the judge believes it to be true. Beyond a reasonable doubt: To prove a termination of parental rights is necessary for an Indian child, the SSCM must show enough evidence that leaves the judge with no reasonable doubt of the damage to the child. This is the highest level of proof required under the law.ICWA Protection for Parents and Indian Custodians ICWA also provides several protections for parents or Indian custodians of an Indian child. These protections include the right to revoke voluntary consents to placements and to adoptions at any time prior to a decree of termination or adoption. Any consent given prior to, or within ten days after the birth of the Indian child shall not be valid. If consent is withdrawn, the Indian child shall be immediately returned to the parent or Indian custodian. After a Decree of Adoption is entered based on a voluntary consent, the parent may petition the court to vacate the adoption decree based on fraud or duress. Upon a finding that consent was obtained through fraud or duress, the court shall vacate the adoption decree and return the child to the parent. However, no adoption decree in effect for at least two years may be challenged on this basis. If an adoption decree is ever vacated or set aside, or the adoptive parents voluntarily consent to termination of their parental rights, the Indian child shall be returned to the biological parent or prior Indian custodian absent a showing that return is not in the best interests of the child.Active Efforts ICWA requires that states provide active efforts to:Provide remedial and rehabilitative services after an investigation and before a decision is made to place the child out of the home, and Provide reunification services after the child has been removed in order to prevent the breakup of the family.Active efforts are more intensive than reasonable efforts. For example, reasonable efforts might be only a referral for services, but active efforts would be to arrange for the best-fitting services and help families engage in those services. ICWAs active efforts standard requires caseworkers to walk the parent or Indian custodian through each step of the case plan, and to assist them in accessing the services and meeting the obligations under the plan. These efforts may include, but should not be limited to: assisting the parent or Indian custodian in their efforts to access food, medical treatment, safe housing, parenting classes, emergency phone service, substance abuse treatment, transportation to/from services, day care, or whatever other services will assist the parent in retaining custody of the child. There must be a reasonable connection between the service offered and the issue that caused the childs removal in the first place. In other words, the active efforts must be clearly designed to facilitate reunification of the child and the family.Placement of Indian Children The Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC) applies to interstate placements under ICWA when the intent is to have the receiving state supervise the placement. However, Tribes are not part of the ICPC and thus if a child is to be placed into tribal custody, the ICPC would not come into play. If an Indian child is transferred to a tribal jurisdiction in another state, the ICPC may apply. The ICPC is not required for a child to be transferred across state lines into tribal jurisdiction. However, if the Tribe would like the sending state (Georgia) to continue making payments to the foster family located within tribal jurisdiction, the Tribe may contact the state within which it is located and request them to utilize the ICPC for the transfer. DFCS would then work with the state of the receiving Tribe to continue making payments.Qualified Expert Witness Under ICWA, a qualified expert witness is someone who can provide the court with knowledge of the social and cultural standards of the Indian childs Tribe to diminish the risk of any cultural bias. The testimony of a qualified expert witness is required in order to make a foster care placement or termination of parental rights for an Indian child. A qualified expert witness can be identified with help from the childs Tribe, the BIA, or Indian organizations, and is meant to be a person with more knowledge than the average social worker or anthropologist. The social worker assigned to the Indian child may not serve as a qualified expert witness in child custody proceedings concerning the child.Georgia Tribes Pursuant to O.C.G.A. §44-12-300, the State of Georgia officially recognizes as legitimate American Indian Tribes of Georgia the following tribes, bands, groups, or communities:Georgia Tribe of Eastern CherokeeP.O. Box 1993Dahlonega, Georgia 30533Lower Muscogee Creek Tribe106 Tall Pine DriveWhigham GA 39897Cherokee of Georgia Tribal Council110 Cherokee WaySaint George, GA 31562If a child is a member of a Georgia Tribe, he or she must have the opportunity to maintain connections with their Indian heritage as well. The SSCM can conduct placements consistent with ICWA placement preferences even though not technically required. Tribal members would likely meet requirements as nonrelated extended family members because tribal communities tend to be related or close-knit communities. Consider the childs tribal members as viable options for holiday visits, tutors, mentors, Court Appointed Special Advocates, etc.If the childs Tribe is seeking federal recognition and is granted such recognition, formal ICWA ",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-1-administration-section-16-indian-child-welfare-act

When direct threat is the justification for the screening out of individuals with disabilities, the decision must be based on individualized assessments that rely on the following: Current medical evidence or the best available objective evidence in determining:     The nature, duration, and severity of the risks; Probability that potential injury will occur; and Whether reasonable modification in policies, practices, or procedures will mitigate the risk. The actual abilities and inabilities of the prospective adoptive or foster caregiver. c. Decisions must never be made based on speculation, stereotypes, generalizations, or unfounded fears about individuals with disabilities. NOTE: A direct threat to the health or safety of others are factors that can be applied to justify the use of disability-related screening criteria for prospective adoptive and foster caregivers. Direct threat is defined as a significant risk of harm to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by modifications in policy, practice, or procedures or by the provision of auxiliary aids or services. An agency is not required to permit an individual to participate in or benefit from a service when ""that individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others."" Make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless DFCS can demonstrate that making the modifications would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a service, program, or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens. The determination of whether a modification is reasonable depends on the specific facts of each case and is not based on generalizations and stereotypes. NOTE: The term reasonable modifications is sometimes referred to as reasonable accommodations. Conduct individualized assessments of qualified individuals with disabilities before making foster care and adoption program application and retention decisions, using the individualized assessment tool and consider, on a case-by-case basis, requests for reasonable modifications (see policy 14.11 Resource Development: Individualized Assessments; and the Individualized Assessment Tool for Prospective & Existing Foster Caregivers). Eliminate any eligibility criteria for participation that screens out or tends to screen out a person with a disability, or any class of individuals with disabilities from full and equal enjoyment in such participation, unless it can be established that such requirement is necessary for the provision of a service, facility, privilege, advantage, or accommodation. Not place a surcharge on a particular qualified individual with a disability or any group of qualified individuals with disabilities to cover the cost of measures, such as the provision of auxiliary aids or program accessibility, that are required to provide nondiscriminatory treatment required by Title II of the ADA and Section 50Not retaliate against, intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by Title II of the ADA, or because the individual has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing. Ensure that no party, as defined by O.C.G.A. § 15-11-2(52) (e.g., the state, a child, parent, guardian, legal custodian) is denied child placement, child custody, visitation, guardianship, foster care, or adoption solely because the party has a disability (including a party who is Legally Blind) as prohibited by the ADA/Section 504 and O.C.G.A. § 30- 4-5.Ensure that no prospective or existing foster/adoptive caregiver is discriminated against or denied the opportunity to participate in the foster care or adoption programs, solely because of such individuals disability (including individuals who are Legally Blind) as prohibited by the ADA/Section 504 and O.C.G.A. § 30-4-5.Ensure that communications with applicants, participants, members of the public and companions with disabilities are as effective as communications with others.NOTE: Please also refer to the DFCS ADA policy MAN3600: Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504. Refer to policy 19.26 Case Management: Case Management Involving Substance Abuse or Use for specific guidance pertaining to ADA and individuals with a history of substance use disorders, current substance use disorders and those participating in medication assisted treatment. This policy of non-discrimination is equally applicable to all DFCS staff, volunteers, interns, contractors, grantees, agents and providers of services. PROCEDURES Upon request by or on behalf of qualified individuals with disabilities, DFCS staff, volunteers, interns, contractors, grantees, agents and providers of services will:Make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures on a case-by-case basis as provided by federal law, unless DFCS can demonstrate that making the modifications would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a service, program, or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. The determination of whether a modification is reasonable depends on the specific facts of each case and is not based on generalizations and stereotypes. Social Services Case Managers (SSCM) have the responsibility and authority to offer, grant, and implement necessary reasonable modifications to customers with disabilities, if such modifications can be readily provided. While SSCMs are authorized to grant customer requests for reasonable modification, they do not have the authority to deny, in whole or in part, such requests or to otherwise refuse requests for reasonable modifications. If SSCMs are unsure about whether a reasonable modification can or should be provided, they shall be required to consult with a Social Services Supervisor (SSS) at the time the request for reasonable modification is received or as soon as reasonably possible thereafter (be sure to adhere to DFCS reasonable modification request processing timeframes, if/when applicable). If a supervisor agrees that a reasonable modification can and should be provided, the SSCM will be required to provide the requested modification to the customer. However, if the SSS recommends that the request for reasonable modification be denied, the SSS shall be required to submit that recommendation for review and written decision by the appropriate Regional ADA/Section 504 Coordinator. d. Direct all written requests for reasonable modifications, made by or on behalf of applicants and participants with disabilities in the foster care and adoption programs, to the Regional ADA/Section 504 Coordinator, if assistance is needed. NOTE: Contact the County DFCS Office or the DFCS State Civil Rights, ADA/Section 504 Coordinator to obtain information about the Regional ADA/Section 504 Coordinator. Regarding a housing situation ONLY, ask for information, if necessary, to determine whether an applicant or participant who has requested a reasonable modification has a disability-related need for the modification, when the individual's disability and need for the modification are not readily apparent or known. Keep the medical records and other health information of applicants and participants in the foster care and adoption program confidential. Ensure meaningful and equal access to services for the sensory impaired, including by all entities contracting with the Department for the provision of services. a. The ADA/Section 504 protect individuals who are sensory impaired (SI). SI individuals either have no ability or a limited ability to see and/or hear. Sensory impairments are considered physical impairments under the ADA. b. The DFCS Civil Rights and ADA/Section 504 Coordinator provides technical guidance and assistance to DFCS offices and programs in securing interpreter services for the sensory impaired and auxiliary aids. To contact the DFCS Civil Rights and ADA/Section 504 Coordinator, please refer to the list of DFCS ADA/Section 504 District and Regional Coordinators found on the DFCS Nondiscrimination and Disability webpage: https://dfcs.georgia.gov/adasection-504- and-civil-rights. NOTE: For language access (i.e., translation, interpretation) refer to policy 1.04 NonDiscriminatory Child Welfare Practices and MAN2001: Limited English Proficiency/Sensory Impairment (LEP/SI). Assess requests for reasonable modifications on a case-by-case basis. a. Seek approval from the County Director of the local DFCS Office before taking action which might adversely affect the ability of applicants and participants with disabilities to participate in the foster care and adoption program; b. The Regional ADA/Section 504 Coordinator will serve as the second level reviewer/approver in cases where the prospective or current foster caregiver has a known disability; c. The Regional ADA/Section 504 Coordinators may contact DFCS ADA/Section 504 Coordinator at the State Office if technical assistance is needed. Consider whether a parent or prospective parent is having difficulty with program requirements due to the disability of the child. For instance, if regular visitation is required but the child cannot meet with the parent due to medical care the child is receiving, then the program requirements will likely need to be modified. Adhere to the key provision of the ADA which prohibits imposing or applying eligibility criteria that screen out or tend to screen out individuals with disabilities, unless the criteria can be shown to be necessary for the provision of the services. Applicants with disabilities must be assessed on an individualized basis and determinations regarding their parental capacity must be based on objective facts and not on stereotypes or generalizations about individuals with disabilities. Additionally, such determinations must consider the individuals existing supports, as well as any disability-related reasonable modifications or services the DFCS could provide to ensure the individual can fully and equally participate in DFCS foster care program.Although the ADA contains no specific definition of reasonable modification and no specific limits are established for what is reasonable, examples are provided. Providing a reasonable modification may take many forms including, but not limited to:Policy, practice, or procedural modifications; Deferral from certain activities; Extensions of deadlines; Granting of waivers; Making existing facilities readily accessible to and usable by an individual with a disability; Alteration of existing facilities; Acquisition or construction of additional facilities; Relocation of a service or program to an accessible facility; Provision of services at accessible alternate sites; 1Acquiring or modifying equipment; 1Providing services for the sensory impaired, such as qualified readers, taped text audio recordings, and Brailled materials.PRACTICE GUIDANCETitle II of the ADA prohibits discrimination against a qualified individual with a disability in programs, activities, and services of public entities. It applies to all state and local governments, their departments, and agencies, and to any entities with which a government agency contracts for services. DFCS must ensure that its service providers agree to comply with the provisions of the ADA when providing services to DFCS and its clients. DFCS is prohibited from making decisions based on unfounded stereotypes, such as application and retention decisions in the foster care and adoption program, about what individuals with disabilities can do, or how much assistance they may require.Qualified Individual with a disabilityTitle II of the ADA defines a qualified individual with a disability as an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable modifications to rules, policies, or practices, the removal of architectural, communication, or transportation barriers, or the provision of auxiliary aids and services, meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by a public entity. Title II protects qualified individuals with disabilities and non-disabled individuals (and entities) that have an association or relationship with someone who is known to be disabled (e.g., the parent of a child with a disability).Disability defined under the ADADisability is defined as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual, a record of such an impairment, or being regarded as having such an impairment. The phrase major life activities includes, but is not limited to: caring for one's self, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, sitting, reaching, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, writing, communicating, interacting with others, and working. It also includes the operation of a major bodily function, including but not limited to: functions of the immune system, special sense organs and skin, normal cell growth, and digestive, genitourinary, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, cardiovascular, endocrine, hemic, lymphatic, musculoskeletal, and reproductive systems. The operation of a major bodily function includes the operation of an individual organ within a body system.The ADA provides examples of various impairments that constitute protected disabilities. Protected physical or mental impairments include, but are not limited to, such contagious and noncontagious diseases and conditions as orthopedic, visual, speech and hearing impairments, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, cancer, heart disease, diabetes, mental retardation, emotional illness, specific learning disabilities, HIV disease (whether symptomatic or non-symptomatic), tuberculosis, drug addiction, alcoholism (but not current illegal drug use). Protected mental and psychological disorders include, but are not limited to, mental retardation, emotional or mental illness, organic brain syndrome, and specific learning disabilities. The ADA excludes homosexuality, bisexuality, transvestism, transsexualism, pedophilia, exhibitionism, voyeurism, gender identity disorders not resulting from physical impairments, or other sexual behavior disorders, compulsive gambling, kleptomania, pyromania, current illegal drug use and psychoactive substance use disorders resulting from current illegal use of drugs.Legally Blind as defined by O.C.G.A. § 30-4-5 (2019)As referenced in this policy, the phrase Legally Blind means: Having vision that is 20/200 or less in the best corrected eye; or Having vision that subtends an angle of not greater than 20 degrees in the best corrected eye.Supportive Parenting Services as defined by O.C.G.A. § 30-4-5 (2019) Supportive parenting services are services that may assist a Legally Blind parent or prospective Legally Blind parent in the effective use of non visual techniques and other alternative methods to enable such parent or prospective parent to successfully discharge parental responsibilities.Foster and adoptive caregiver applicants and participants with disabilities The purpose of the DFCS foster care and adoption program is to promote the safety and wellbeing of children in DFCS care. As defined by the Administration for Children and Families, foster care means 24-hour substitute care for children placed away from their parents or guardians and for whom the title IV-E agency has placement and care responsibility (45 C.F.R. Section 1355.20). The recipient of the services of the DFCS foster care program is the child in foster care. DFCS seeks to identify qualified individuals to partner with it in caring for, supervising, protecting and promoting the welfare of children in foster care because of abuse or neglect, twenty-four hours a day and seven days a week.DFCS is prohibited from establishing policies and practices that categorically limit or exclude qualified individuals with disabilities from participating in the DFCS foster care and adoption program. Individuals with disabilities must be treated on a case-by-case basis consistent with facts and objective evidence. Upon request from qualified foster care and adoption program applicants with disabilities, DFCS will make reasonable modifications and provide auxiliary aids which would not fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity, or result in undue financial and/or administrative burdens. The determination of whether DFCS is required to provide a prospective or current foster caregiver an auxiliary aid or modify its policy, practice, or procedures is a fact-specific, case-by-case inquiry that depends on DFCS individually assessing the disabled prospective or current foster caregiver.For instance, DFCS may modify its training courses to extend the frequency and/or duration of the courses to accommodate a prospective or current foster caregiver whose disability is connected to the modification request. DFCS may also provide a qualified interpreter for a training course and translate applications/course materials to provide a meaningful opportunity for the prospective or current foster caregiver to participate. DFCS is not required to permit an individual to participate in or benefit from the services, programs, or activities when that individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of a child(ren) in DFCS care. In determining whether an individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others, DFCS must make an individualized assessment, based on reasonable judgment that relies on current medical knowledge or on the best available objective evidence, to ascertain: the nature, duration, and severity of the risk; the probability that the potential injury will actually occur; and whether reasonable modifications of policies, practices, or procedures or the provision of auxiliary aids or services will mitigate the risk (see policy 14.11 Resource Development: Individualized Assessments).DFCS shall make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless DFCS determines that the modification would fundamentallyalter the nature of the foster care and adoption program or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens. Considerations for requests for reasonable modifications, such as those concerning respite care, are to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and processed in accordance with policy 1.4 Administration: Non-Discriminatory Child Welfare Practices (Procedures section). Denials of requests for reasonable modification are to be made by the State DFCS Civil Rights, ADA/Section 504 Coordinator (or by the DFCS Division Director or his/her designee). Questions should be directed to the appropriate Regional ADA/Section 504 Coordinator and the State DFCS Civil Rights, ADA/Section 504 Coordinator.How should applicants and participants in the foster care and adoption programs make requests for reasonable modifications?Requests for reasonable modifications made by or on behalf of applicants and participants with disabilities in the foster care and adoption programs shall be handled as described in this policy and MAN3600: Americans with Disabilities Act/Section 504. Refer to the Forms and Tools section below for a link to the directory of the Regional ADA/504 Coordinator. The directory includes the State and Regional ADA/504 Coordinators and provides a list of counties in each region. The local County Department may also be contacted for information on how to reach the Regional ADA/Section 504 Coordinators.ADA Application to DFCS Service ProvidersDFCS collaborates with many service providers in an effort to provide an array of services to meet the needs of the children and families served. The ADA requirements also apply to agencies and private entities that have entered into contracts or agreements with DFCS. DFCS must ensure that its service providers agree to comply with the provisions of the ADA when providing services for DFCS.Complaints Complaints alleging disability discrimination are to be filed within 180 days of the date of alleged discrimination. For more information about filing a complaint, refer to policy 1.4 Administration: Non-Discriminatory Child Welfare Practices and policy 1.16 Administration: Civil Rights Complaint Process. If additional information is needed regarding DFCS civil rights/disability compliance, refer to https://dfcs.georgia.gov/adasection-504-and-civil-rights.

DFCS has adopted a three-pillar approach to achieve the goals set forth in the strategic plan and to realize its vision and mission. This serves as a framework for the organizations overall approach to child welfare services.1. The first pillar includes the establishment and adoption of a research-based practice model that will serve as the foundation to keep kids safe and strengthen families.2. The second pillar focuses on developing a robust workforce with expertise and training.3. The third pillar addresses constituent engagement to build consensus and collaboration among partners, staff, and stakeholders.Description of Programs Title IV-A: Federal funds to states for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). The TANF program is designed to help needy families achieve self-sufficiency. States receive block grants to design and operate programs that provide assistance to needy families so that children can be cared for in their own homes, and to reduce the dependency of needy parents by promoting job preparation, work and marriage. TANF services are provided through the DFCS Office of Family Independence. Title IV-B: Title IVB of the Social Security Act includes two components, referred to as subparts 1 and 2. Subpart 1 is a discretionary grant program composed primarily of the Stephanie Tubbs Jones Child Welfare Services (CWS) program. CWS funds can be used for a broad variety of child welfare services including, but not limited to, the prevention of maltreatment, family preservation, family reunification, services for foster and adopted children, and training for child welfare professionals. Examples of services or activities that may be supported include investigations of child abuse or neglect, homemaker services, respite care, family or individual counseling, caseworker visits to children whether in their own homes or in foster care, case planning and case Page 3 of 4 Administration of Child Welfare Services review services for children in foster care, pre/post- adoption support services, and emergency assistance. Subpart 2, the Promoting Safe and Stable Families (PSSF) program, has both capped entitlement and discretionary funding components. This program primarily funds family support, family preservation, time-limited reunification, and adoptionpromotion and support activities (see policy 18.2 Support Services to Preserve or Reunify Families: Promoting Safe and Stable Families (PSSF)). Title IV-D: Title IV-D of the Social Security Act authorizes federal assistance for state run child support enforcement programs. These funds help cover the operational costs involved in child support enforcement, which help parents establish paternity, initiate new child support orders, and collect unpaid child support, among other services. Child Support Services are provided through the Department Human Services, Division of Child Support Services. Title IV-E: Title IV-E of the Social Security Act addresses major components of child welfare. Its focus is on providing safe and stable out-of-home care for children who are in out-of-home care due to child maltreatment or other circumstances until they are able to achieve permanency in their placement by being safely returned home, placed permanently with adoptive families, or placed in other planned arrangements. Title IVE funds are available for monthly maintenance payments for the daily care and supervision of eligible children, administrative costs to manage the program, training of staff and foster care providers, recruitment of foster and adoptive parents, adoption assistance, and implementation and operation of a Comprehensive Child Welfare Information System (CCWIS). Title XVI: Title XVI benefits, also known as Supplemental Security Income (SSI), are needs-based disability benefits that are administered by the Social Security Administration. Applicants do not need to have any work credits in order to qualify for Title XVI benefits. SSI is designed to help aged, blind, and disabled people (including children under age 18), who have little or no income, and it provides cash to meet basic needs for food, clothing, and shelter (see policy 12.4 Adoption Assistance: Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Adoption Assistance Benefits). Title XIX: Title XIX of the Social Security Act authorized the Medicaid program. Medicaid is a joint state-federal program. Its purpose is to provide health care to individuals who have low incomes, including persons who are blind or disabled. States, territories, and the District of Columbia must meet certain requirements to receive matching funds from the federal government to participate. The match rate is based on the poverty level within the state. Title XX: Title XX of the Social Security Act, also referred to as the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG), is a capped entitlement program. Thus, States are entitled to their share, according to a formula, of a nationwide funding ceiling or ""cap,"" which is specified in statute. Block grant funds are given to States to help them achieve a wide range of social policy goals, which include preventing child abuse, increasing the availability of childcare, and providing community-based care for the elderly and disabled. CAPTA: The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) provides Federal funding to States in support of child abuse and neglect prevention, assessment, investigation, prosecution, and treatment activities and also provides grants to public agencies and nonprofit organizations, including Indian Tribes and Tribal organizations, for demonstration programs and projects.FORMS AND TOOLS DFCS Regional Map Vision, Mission, and Guiding Principles",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-child-welfare-policy-manual-chapter-1-administration-section-10-administration-child

GA :: Foster Parent Manual 2003 :: Information Just For You :: Grievance Procedures,Georgia,Rules,"2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004, 2003",Administrative process,,,"The Division of Family and Children Services recognizes the need for a systematic process of expression, examination and resolution of foster parent grievances. It is further recognized that as people work together, conflicts will arise which may result in the deterioration of the quality of relationships and the quality of care provided. Each foster parent has the right to file a grievance when he/she has an irreconcilable difference with the Department. The grievance procedure is an administrative, not a legal process. Therefore, the presence of attorneys will not be allowed. This does not preclude the foster parents right to involve an attorney should they desire to take legal action at a future date. No additional persons shall attend.The foster parent(s) shall be free to use the procedure without fear of reprisal. The foster parent(s) and staff responding to the complaint should make all reasonable efforts to resolve the issues before a written grievance is filed by the foster parent(s). An informal meeting is required before the county can accept the Step I Grievance. Upon identification of a problem, an immediately held informal meeting, including the foster parents(s), caseworkers and supervisor(s) sometimes solves the problem and reduces the anxiety of a formal grievance and the possibility of participants retreating into entrenched positions. Reasonable efforts shall be made by the parties to reach a clear understanding of the exact nature of the complaint, the issues involved, the relief requested, and to achieve resolution of the matter at the lowest possible step. The need for open and purposeful communication between foster care staff and foster parents is vital to the prevention or early resolution of any complaints. Every effort should be made to resolve the issue at this level, based on the following grievable issues. If the required informal meeting fails to resolve the issues, the foster parent(s) has the right to move to the formal steps of the Grievance Procedure. This formal request is to be made on the Request for Step I Foster Parent Grievance Meeting, Form 80, and sent to the Director of the local county department. Once the grievance is filed, staff may not intervene in progression of the steps. However, the foster parent(s) can provide a written notice at any step in the grievance process asking to withdraw the grievance. THE FOLLOWING ARE THE ONLY GRIEVABLE ISSUES:The County Department with financial responsibility for the child fails to provide reimbursement for the child in care in accordance with established per diem rates. The County Department with financial responsibility for the child fails to provide reimbursement for the child in care in accordance with established clothing allowances for initial clothing, annual clothing, and special clothing. The County Department with financial responsibility for the child fails to provide reimbursement for supplemental supervision (approved childcare) for working Foster Parents in accordance with State rates and policy. The County Department with financial responsibility for the child fails to pay concurrent per diem to Foster Parents when the absence of the child is planned and purposeful; e.g., visits with a parent or relative; pre-placement visits to another facility, hospitalization, admission to other institutions for evaluation, camp, respite, ILP activities, and runaway (provided the foster parent is willing to have the child returned). The local County Department fails to provide face-to face contact with the foster parent(s) to discuss the reasons for the involuntary closure of their foster home and to offer support to the Foster Family as children are placed in other resources. The local County Department fails to send a letter describing the reasons the home is being closed and notification of the closing date within 10 working days of the face-to-face contact. The local County Department denies the Foster Parent reasonable access to non-identifying information from the placement or child protective services record, with respect to any child who has been placed in the care of the Foster parents or for whom Foster Care is being sought. The County Department denies the Foster Parent assistance with preparing a written request for access to a childs record and a response to the written request within a 14-calendar day time frame as specified in the law, O.C.G.A. 49-5-41 (D). (Open records request)Step 1 Implementation of the first step is a meeting of the Foster Parent(s) with the County Director or Deputy Director or Social Services Program Director and the supervisor(s). This meeting is held within 15 working days of receipt of the formal grievance request. The caseworker is also included in the meeting. Foster Parents shall be notified of the decision regarding their Step 1 grievance at the meeting. This decision will be confirmed in writing to the Foster Parents by certified mail and the Field and County offices within 48 hours on Form 81. If the Foster Parent disagrees with the Departments Step I decision, they may apply for a Step II grievance within 5 business days of receipt of the Departments written decision. Application for Step II Grievance must be made on State Form 82 and must be submitted to the local county director.STEP IIADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW Step II will consist of a committee formed by the Field Director, who serves as the chairperson. The committee shall meet within fifteen (15) working days of the date of receipt of the formal request, Step II. It will consist of the Field Director, Consultation and Support Consultant and one other state staff. The Field Director shall select the third state staff person who has not previously been involved in the case. The County Director selects a maximum of two staff to present the agencys position. It is expected that all information prerequisite to informed decision-making shall be available to the committee for consideration. At the conclusion of the presentations, the two staff presenting the agency position and the grieving Foster Parent(s) may be excused to allow discussion among the panel members. The Foster Parents shall be notified of the decision regarding their Step II grievance at the meeting. This decision will be confirmed by the committee in writing to the Foster Parent(s) by certified mail and the County offices within 48 hours of the meeting on Form 83. All pertinent information shall be forwarded to the Division Director immediately following the conclusion of Step II. If the Foster Parent disagrees with the Departments Step II decision, they may apply for a Step III grievance within five business days of the Departments written decision. Application for Step III Grievance must be made on State Form 84 and must be submitted to the Social Services Section Director.Step III Step III will be a paper review by the Social Services Section Director.

The ILP seeks to improve the educational, social and personal outlook of all youth in DFCS custody, sixteen and above, and to work towards youth becoming self sufficient adults in the future. Who are the People Involved in the ILP? People are the key to the success of the Independent Living Program. Each person involved has a significant role in ensuring that our youth gain the skills and knowledge needed to function in society. Some of the key people involved include:youth in placement agency staff -foster parents the ILP coordinator birth parents, and other community resources.How Can Youth Get Involved in ILP? The agency case manager usually provides the initial referral of the youth to the ILP Coordinator within 30 days of the youth turning 14 years old. The initial referral process provides valuable information to the ILP Coordinator. The Case Manager and the foster parent will provide on-going information that might impact the independent living plan of the youth. The support and active participation of both the foster parent and the youths Case Manager are essential in ensuring the participation of the youth in the program. The active participation of youth in the development of their Written Transitional Living Plans (WTLP), their active participation in the development of short term goals, and their motivation and investment in the outcome, increase their chances for successful transition into adulthood after leaving foster care. The WTLP builds on the strengths of youth in care and identifies needs that impact their skill development. What Type Services and Activities Does ILP Provide? A wide range of services and activities are made available to youth through the ILP. Surveys and personal assessment instruments are provided to help youth pinpoint tasks and knowledge regarding daily living skills they already possess and identifies those areas that require further development. Throughout the year, youth will be invited to attend a variety of activities. These may include:Meetings and Mini-Conferences focusing on such topics as:Planning for College/Technical School Money Management Substance Abuse Locating and Maintaining Housing How to Find and Keep a Job Obtaining Proper identification and Documents Health Education Problem Solving Skills Leisure Time ActivitiesAwards Banquets for ILP Youth Summer Youth Conference (overnight) Visits on College Campuses Individual Sessions to Develop Personal Goals Financial Aid Workshops On-going ServicesEducational (remedial education /tutoring, vocational training) Daily living skills (budgeting, securing and maintaining housing, nutrition, laundry) Employment preparation (job seeking/job retention skills, collaboration with Job Corp, JTPA, Apprenticeship) Health maintenance (safety/first aid, sexuality, health education/prevention) Counseling (individual, group, peer support, family) Parenting skills (pre-natal, child care, child development, discipline)What Can Foster Parents do To Support the Success of the ILP? Foster parents play a major role on the Independent Living team, providing youth with appropriate adult role modeling behavior and actively teaching daily living skills. By appropriately handling problems and issues relating to your spouse, friends or relatives, and making daily decisions, the foster parent demonstrates to the youth a real life example of the successful application of life skills. Foster parents also provide youth with hands on experience in learning practical skills such as doing the laundry, cleaning house, grocery shopping, budgeting, etc. Most importantly, however, the foster parent can remain as a support system for youth who transition from foster care, but need a home to return to for visits and moral support. How Can the Community Assist With the ILP? The community at large can be a resource for the Independent Living Program in a variety of ways. Other service related agencies can provide support and services to youth; businesses can help provide jobs and job training; donations to conferences and group meetings can be made; speakers, trainers can volunteer to work with youth; and mentors from the community can be trained to provide support and encouragement.What is the Birth Parents Role in the ILP? Birth parents are a key ingredient in the successful transition of youth from adolescence to young adulthood. Although, in many instances birth parents are no longer involved with youth who have grown up in foster care, there are situations where birth parents do maintain contact. Birth parents can encourage youth do well and give permission for the youth to achieve goals. They also provide an on-going safety net should their plans for emancipation and independence fall short. Youth contact with birth parents also help to bring clarity to the issues surrounding their initial placement in care, and remove some of the fantasy and denial associated with separation. What is the Role of the ILP Coordinator (ILC)? The ILP Coordinators role is to reach, motivate, lead and locate resources for youth ages 14-21 in DFCS custody and to enable them to make a successful transition to post-foster care living. The approaches taken to accomplish this may differ based on the demographics of the ILCs assigned area. Area Field Coordinators typically serve an area that includes one or more clusters of counties, with youth scattered along a wide geographical area. Urban Area Coordinators usually are assigned to one large geographic area. Although the goals for each remain the same, the strategies used to accomplish the goals of the Independent Living Program may differ.Contact your local Independent Living Coordinator for information regarding the ILP in your area. As a foster parent, if you are providing care for youth who are 14 and over, you will provide an invaluable service by directing and encouraging their involvement in the Independent Living Program.Page 81",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-foster-parent-manual-2003-information-just-you-independent-living-program

Hopefully, as a foster parent, your only involvement with CPS will be in the placement and removal of children from your home under ordinary circumstances. In reality, however, foster parents sometimes find themselves faced with allegations of child abuse and neglect which result in a CPS/SIU investigation of their home. Child Abuse means any physical injury or death inflicted upon a child by a parent or caretaker by other than accidental means. Neglect refers to a caretakers deliberate or chronic disregard of the needs (physical, intellectual, social and emotional) essential to a childs development as a human being, or the deliberate permission of a child to experience avoidable pain and suffering.When a report of the maltreatment of a child in your home is alleged, the following procedures generally occur:Your county DFCS office has a written internal procedure to assure that the appropriate staff persons are notified when allegations of abuse or neglect of children in foster homes are received. DFCS CPS staff has a mandatory immediate response time (Taylor v. Ledbetter) of 0-24 hours in investigating complaints of abuse or neglect of children in DFCS custody. The report is screened by agency supervisory staff to determine if it meets the criteria for investigation by CPS (the report may be a violation of the discipline policy or other foster care policy violation which requires an assessment by Placement staff). Following the initial CPS contact, the foster parent may be contacted by the Resource Development Case manager who may at this time serve in a supportive role. However, this interaction should not compromise the integrity of the investigation. DFCS immediately forwards all reports alleging abuse or neglect of children in agency custody to law enforcement. A joint investigation may or may not be required. DFCS removes the child from the foster home if the childs safety cannot be assured. A CPS Case Manager who is not directly involved in services to you will be assigned to complete the investigation in order to maintain objectivity. The CPS Case Manager will be interviewing various persons, including the foster parent, the child, Case Managers witnesses, the reporter and, in addition, will review case records, etc., for additional information relative to the case. The County DFCS agency will conduct a staffing with all involved Supervisors and Case Managers to 1) share the results of the investigation 2) review the need to remove the child, and 3) jointly develop a plan of action. If allegations are serious and substantiated, the foster home is closed. If allegations are unsubstantiated, minor, reactive and not chronic, corrective, or the caregiver is amenable to change and a Case Plan instituted to assist foster parents and prevent further abuse, the home may remain open. THE FINAL DECISION TO CLOSE A FOSTER HOME LIES WITH THE DFCS COUNTY DIRECTOR.Page 76",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-foster-parent-manual-2003-information-just-you-child-protective-services

The states policy regarding the discipline of children in care emanated from the much heralded case that was decided in the United States District Court -- Taylor v. Ledbetter.Kathy Jo Taylor was a child injured while living in an agency foster home. Her guardian ad litem filed suit against the Department of Human Resources and the case was settled in the United Stated District Court on October 6, 1989. The two general provisions of this consent order as it relates to CPS are as follows:The improper punishment of children in foster care is prohibited. (See prohibited practices under the Discipline heading in this manual) The investigation of and response to alleged incidents of unsuitable care or abuse and neglect shall occur immediately (within 24 hours of receipt of referral by foster care supervisor) to ensure the continued safety of the child in the foster home placement.The assessment of a foster home resulting from allegations of discipline or other foster care policy infractions may experience any or all of the following consequences:Removal of the child(ren) A CPS investigation Corrective Action Plan and Interview Closure of the home Criminal prosecutionThe following guidelines are generally followed following a report of discipline and other foster care policy violations.If the assessment confirms an initial violation of the discipline or other foster care policy, a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) may be initiated by a Placement staff person to insure the problem is addressed and a solution underway. The CAP is reviewed with the foster parents by the case Manager in a positive manner, with the added explanation that there is no CPS activity in the case. A part of the CAP includes re-teaching and support to the foster parent in effecting change in their implementation of discipline or other foster care policy issues. The CAP is signed by the Case Manager implementing the plan and the foster parents involved. A copy is given to the foster parents and a DFCS copy is filed in the foster home record.The foster home is closely monitored for a stated period of time to assure that the requirements of the CAP are completed. Foster parents are allowed only one violation of the discipline policy. However, if a second violation occurs outside a three-year period, the home may remain open based on the circumstances and at the agency's discretion. In those instances where the CPS investigation or the assessment for discipline policy violations are not substantiated, serious consideration may still be given to home closure if other serious concerns are noted. When it is necessary to relocate children due to discipline policy violations, the ten-day notification to a foster family that a child is being removed from the home is waived.The ultimate decision on closure of a foster home because of a violation of foster care policy rests with the County Director. In reaching this decision, the County Director considers factors such as the severity of the incident, the patterns and parenting history demonstrated by the foster parents, the personality of the child involved, the willingness of the foster parents to look at alternative approaches to correct the problem or change the undesirable behavior; (i.e., training or counseling), and the quality of the relationship between the foster parents and the child.Violation of the discipline policy and the decisions made are not subject to appeal at the state level. Decisions made as a result of Child Protective Services investigations are not grievable under the Foster Parent Grievance Procedures. Even though a CPS investigation may not be substantiated, the foster home may still be closed as a result of issues/concerns arising from the investigation.Page 74",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-foster-parent-manual-2003-information-just-you-assessment-complaints-placement-staff

Some complaints may be valid, but others are not. Without checking further into the situation, the validity of the complaint cannot be determined. Therefore, for everyones protection  yours, the childs and the agencys  each complaint received by DFCS must be carefully assessed. Keep in mind, however, this does not mean that the agency has accepted the report as true. Your Case Manager will discuss with you any complaint made against you and the outcome of the assessment. A good rule to keep in mind in order to avoid complaints from the community is to share your role as foster parents with neighbors. Let them know that it takes a village to raise a child and that you welcome their input and observations as neighbors who have the interest of the child at heart. Introduce the children to your neighbors, and make each child aware of the neighbors care and concern for their well being also. Each situation is different. Some neighbors may be approached in this manner and others, of course, may not. Use your best judgment in this regard. In the event the school system sends permission slips requesting authority to administer corporal punishment to children who are in the temporary or permanent custody of the agency, foster parents are to deny such permission.Page 74",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-foster-parent-manual-2003-information-just-you-complaints-community

Issues primarily related to 1) support services for children and families and, 2) support and training for foster parents and foster care workers are all current in both the state and local organizations. In addition, AFPAG and the local associations have been instrumental in the development and implementation of some DFCS policy changes. Examples include the development of and revisions to the foster parent grievance procedure, training requirements, the smoke alarm requirement, state reimbursement for foster children funeral expenses, practices related to the removal of children from foster homes, school clothing for kindergarten children, the participation of foster parents in reviews and the development of form 469, Foster Child Information Sheet. Some association have been successful in planning and providing excellent regional training sessions. The AFPAG plans and makes all arrangements for an annual statewide educational training conference. The most effective associations work closely with their County DFCS offices.

As is the case with any circumstance such as this, it may be somewhat difficult to think of all the things that need to be done.General Guidelines for Agency Staff and Foster Parents Since the circumstances surrounding the death of a child are never exactly the same, judgment has to be used in terms of which step to take first. For example, the childs death may be due to a long illness, with relatives and friends aware of the seriousness of the condition. In other instances, the death may be due to an accident, foster parent neglect/abuse or a medical emergency. Most deaths will occur in a hospital; however, a death could very likely occur in the foster home or elsewhere. An autopsy will be required.CPS/Special Investigator Intervention  The death of a child in your home is immediately reported to the childs Case Manager, or the Supervisor or Director if the Case Manager cannot be contacted. Deaths involving children in DHR/DFCS custody are immediately relayed to DFCS management staff and the assigned area Field Director in the childs county of residence. An internal DFCS review team examines the circumstances and reported cause of the childs death, as well as all relevant case information, decisions, and actions involving CPS. Law enforcement is also involved in investigating the death of a child in care.To provide additional direction in this process, a group of foster parents and an agency staff person developed a set of general guidelines that are included in this section for your information. This information may be very beneficial if the need should arise.Responsibility of the agency  If parental rights have been terminated or if the birth parents are financially unable or unavailable to provide for the childs burial, the agency will assume responsibility for the costs involved. A maximum of $1,000.00 is available from state funds to assist with burial expenses. Sometimes, the child has additional funds that may be used toward burial. The services, while usually simple, can be planned in good taste, respecting both the deceased child and those who are left to mourn. It is the responsibility of the case manager to ensure the planning of appropriate services by working closely with the birth parents, the foster family, and the funeral home. Planning includes arranging for a clergyman, as desired, to conduct the services and planning the funeral program. Responsibility of the Case Manager  The childs Case Manager will be supportive and helpful to those who have had a meaningful and/or legal relationship with the child. This includes relatives (birth parents, siblings and other relatives) and foster parents (current and former). The focus of the Case Managers responsibility is to inform the appropriate persons of the death, to understand and respect their grief and to assist the birth parents in planning an appropriate service. This would include making them aware of the foster parents interest in attending the service or in participating in some other way. If the birth parents are not available, the Case Manager will initiate plans for the burial service and other procedures that need to be completed. It is anticipated the childs Case Manager and other staff and service providers who have recently worked closely with the child or family may desire to attend the services. You or DFCS staff may also want to contribute toward flowers or make some other donation in memory of the child.Responsibility of the Birth Parents  The birth parents retain the right to plan the burial services of the child. If financially able to do so, they will assume responsibility for all expenses related to the services. The Case Manager will assist them in planning, if requested to do so. If parental rights have been terminated or if parents cannot be located or refuse to participate, and the agency has custody, the agency has the duty to assume responsibility of planning services. As the childs foster parent or former foster parent, you will be given the opportunity to participate in the planning, should you make such a request. Rights of the Foster Parents  Foster parents have no legal responsibility in regard to the burial of a child. However, as primary caretaker of the deceased child, you do have the responsibility of cooperating with the agency in the required investigation of the childs death and any surrounding circumstances, if applicable. You do have a right to express your sympathy and grief in appropriate ways, in keeping with the desires and wishes of the birth parents. You may want to attend the funeral, send flowers, or make a donation in memory of the child in some other way. Foster parents should be aware that the birth parents may react to the loss of their child by becoming very hostile to you, the agency, and the hospital or medical staff. Dont hesitate to seek support from the childs worker or your own foster home worker, if necessary.Page 71",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-foster-parent-manual-2003-special-issues-foster-parenting-death-child-care

If this should be the case, there are several pointers to keep in mind:Contact the childs case manager when you feel a volunteer can help with a child. Do not allow a volunteer to take the child away from your home without the permission of the agency. DFCS is required to obtain clearance (a Criminal Record and CPS Check) on any volunteers who come in direct contact with children in placement. Do not discuss personal information regarding the childs case. For school-aged children, get their input as to their thoughts and feelings about interacting with a volunteer person or group.Page 70",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-foster-parent-manual-2003-special-issues-foster-parenting-use-community-volunteers

While many frown upon the characterization of specific breeds of dogs as vicious or dangerous, it is important that foster parents are alert to the potential risks and consequences that are forever present with dogs and other animal pets. Children are usually bitten by dogs with whom they are familiar  their own, a neighbors or the dog of a friend. The bodily areas usually attacked or bitten by dogs include the childs face, hands, neck and head. Listed in this section are breeds of dogs that, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association, are said to have higher incidences of bites than other breeds.In the absence of State Law specifically relating to the identification and proper maintenance of dogs that are considered to be dangerous, the Department of Family and Children Services has instituted the following guidelines relative to pet safety in the foster home. In the interest of the children placed in your home, foster parents are required to exercise reasonable safety precautions when children are around pets. The following should be exercised to promote the safety of the child:Monitor children when they are around pets. Refrain from bringing into the home any type or breed of animal that has a known history of violence and/or aggressiveness toward people. Safely secure animals that have displayed violent and/or aggressive behavior toward people inside a cage, pen, or fence that prevents a child from entering and the dog from escaping. When acquiring a pet for the home, choose a breed or type of animal that has, at the least, a history of being people-friendly when acquiring pets for the foster home. Provide opportunities and instruction to children in care regarding safe socialization habits with people-friendly breeds of animals.  Report immediately to the agency any acts of violence toward a child in care or others by an animal in the foster home. Carefully review the Foster Parent Manual and research other sources for information regarding animal safety.ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES Choosing a Pet for the Home  While no specific breed of dog is exempt from becoming aggressive, the dogs that are indicated by the American Veterinary Medical Association to have higher incidences of bites include the following:Chow Chow German shepherd Pit bull Akita Rottweiler Doberman Chihuahua Dachshund Terriers Husky-type Wolf-dog MalamuteThis, by no means, is to infer that all dogs of the breeds listed are aggressive and are prone to attack humans; they do, however, require less provocation or coaxing than dogs of other breeds do. Dogs that are said to be less aggressive toward humans, but must be closely monitored, nonetheless, include the following breeds:Labrador Retriever Vizsla Brittany Spaniel Collie Golden Retriever Australian Shepherd Old English Sheepdog Bloodhound Basset Hound English Bulldog Norwegian Elkhound KeeshondChild and Dog Safety Tips  Being around and interacting with pets can be one of the childs fondest memories of being in care. A close, nurturing relationship with a pet can provide a very therapeutic experience for a child. Unfortunately, this may not prove to be true with the childs relationship with other animals or the same animal under less friendly circumstances. While the laws in Georgia governing dog safety do not provide a more preventive remedy, there are measures that foster parents can take to support and ensure the safety of children around animals. If you are contemplating buying a pet, check with your local vet, pet store or go to Purinas website for assistance in locating people-friendly or child-friendly pets. Additional guidelines foster parents should consider when bringing a pet dog into the home include the following:Choose a puppy rather than an older dog that may be less friendly toward strangers. An older dog should be assessed by a vet to determine if he is suitable for children. Demonstrate for the children acceptable behavior toward pets prior to the dogs arrival. Teach children how to assist with the feeding, maintenance and training of the dog. This spawns a relationship with the dog and teaches them a sense of responsibility. Interact with the dog in the presence of the children. Supervise children closely when playing with a dog. Teach children the proper way get acquainted with dogs. Discourage children from teasing or handling the dog roughly. Refrain from including the dog at parties or other situations of high excitability or aggressiveness. The dog may too become excited and aggressive. Train the dog to respond to your commands.Provide opportunities for safe socialization with dogs. Children should be instructed in habits of sociability and safe behavior toward dogs, using the following tips and guidelines:A dog wagging its tail is not always friendly. Never attempt to touch a strange dog. Never touch a dog that is growling, barking or showing its teeth. Never stare a dog in the eye when it is behaving aggressively. Back away slowly from an aggressive dog; never run. If knocked down by an aggressive dog, protect the head and neck with the hands and forearms, taking care to keep the hands closed to protect the fingers. Never run up to a dog. Never approach a dog without grown-up supervision, especially a strange dog. Allow the dog to sniff your scent before attempting to pet or touch him. Never approach a guard dog or a watchdog. Obey owners sign regarding the potential danger of dogs. Never disturb a dog that is eating or has a treat of any sort in its mouth. Dont yell, make loud noises, or attempt to frighten the dog. Dont attempt to ride on the dogs back. Refrain from pulling the dogs ears, touching his eyes, or pulling its tail.Foster parents are encouraged to seek out additional information regarding the safety of children in the presence of dogs.

Re-certification is not reimbursable and, therefore, not required. Complete a Basic Water Rescue class that is designed to prevent and respond to water emergencies within the first year of approval or as soon as the course is made available in your area. Basic Water Rescue addresses recognition, prevention and response to water emergencies. Provide some form of written verification (letter of verification, certificate, etc.) that the swimming, First Aid, CPR and Basic Water Rescue requirements have been completed. Enroll all children placed in the home, three (3) years and older, in a swimming class at the local YMCA or other free or inexpensive facility some time during the first year of placement in the home. The course must be taught by a certified swimming instructor and should be retaken until the child learns to swim. The Case Manager should be contacted immediately if a child is unable to complete the required swimming or water safety course due to mental or physical challenges. Complete the childs swimming requirements within one (1) year of placement in the home. Refrain from allowing children who have not completed a course in swimming in or around pools and other large bodies of water unless closely supervised by an adult. Provide close adult supervision of children at all times. Ensure that the pool or waterfront area meets local and/or state ordinances. Surround the pool with a fence that is enclosed on all sides (isolate the pool from the yard) and has a gate that locks. The fence should be of sufficient height to prevent the entry of young children. Fences enclosing pools should be at least forty-eight (48) inches in height with vertical or horizontal openings that are no more the four(4) inches wide. Above-ground pools - The structure of an above-ground pool may also be used to meet the fence requirement. When the structure is used as a fence, or a fence is mounted on top of the above ground pool, the pool must be made inaccessible by removing the steps or ladder, or by surrounding the steps or the ladder itself with a fence and a gate that locks. The fence should be at least 48 inches in height, with vertical or horizontal openings that are no more than four (4) inches wide. Always provide direct adult supervision where bodies of water exist, this includes the freestanding kiddy pools that vary in depth. Have children wear a U.S. Coast Guard approved personal flotation device (life vest, jacket, etc.) when on a boat or other watercraft.Although the water safety policy makes specific reference to swimming pools, extra safety precaution (i.e., close supervision, sensors, alarms, locks, etc.) must also be taken with lakes and ponds, especially ponds that are located on the same property as the foster home.Guidelines:There are additional precautions foster parents can take to assure the safety of children in and around water. You are also encouraged to check with local medical facilities or go online (surf the web) to increase your awareness of water safety strategies for children. Additional steps that may be taken to ensure the safety of children in your care include the following:Never leave children unattended near any source of standing water, including bathtubs, swimming pools, hot tubs, or even large buckets of water for infants and toddlers. Children have drowned in as little as one to two inches of water! Install self-closing/self-latching devices on windows or doors leading to pool/lake area (if possible), as well as on pool gates. Drain and cover pools that are not to be used for an extended period of time. Remove pool cover completely when pool is in use to prevent children from getting trapped underneath. Remove portable steps to above ground pools when the pool is not in use. Keep a cordless phone at hand ( or install a pool-side jack) to prevent having to go indoors briefly to use the telephone, leaving children unsupervised. Program emergency numbers for quick dialing. Clearly identify the deep and shallow ends of the pool. Equip the swimming pool or water area with such life saving devices as ring buoys, rescue tubes or other floatation devices such as water wings, etc. Flotation devices should never be used as a substitute for proper supervision. Children should never be left unsupervised while in or near water simply because they know how to swim.*Water or bodies of water for the purpose of this policy include streams, lakes, rivers, creeks, canals, swamps, oceans and flooded areas and all pools.

The state of Georgia enacted the Child Safety Seat Law, which states in essence that: Every driver transporting a child passenger four (4) years of age and under shall provide for the protection of the child with a federally approved child safety seat. The seat must be installed and used according to the manufacturers instructions. DFCS children must be individually (seat) belted in cars. Any car transporting a child in care must be equipped with working seat belts or updated to meet this requirement.Special Tips for Car Seat Safety:Never allow the seat strap to be twisted as this is more likely to cut into the childs body than a flattened seat strap. Straps may be washed, but never ironed. Babies up to 20 pounds are safest riding in the rear of the car with car seat facing rear. Do not use a safety seat with a shield as it could make contact with the infants face or neck during impact. See illustration A in appendix. Children over 20 pounds may ride in the rear of the car, buckled in and facing forward. However, the longer a child is allowed to ride facing the rear of the vehicle, the better. The neck and spinal chord are better protected in a young child in this position. See illustration B in Appendix. Booster seats, with or without a shield may be used for children over 40 pounds or three (4) years old and over. Secure the child with both a lap and shoulder belt if the booster seat has no shield. See illustration C in appendix. Secure the child with a lap belt only if the booster seat has a shield. See illustration D in appendix. Follow carefully the manufacturers instructions for installation and use.The American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that pre-term infants born earlier than 37 weeks be observed for possible breathing difficulties when placed in a semi-reclining restraint (car seat) prior to discharge from the hospital. Some preemies develop breathing problems when placed in this position. A car bed or other alternative child restraint devices would be more appropriate for infants who have to travel in a prone, supine, or semi-upright position. A written physicians statement or recommendation regarding the need for a car bed or some other alternative child restraint device vs. a child restraint seat (car seat) is required prior to its use. Take special precautions to refrain from placing these infants in semi-reclining positions at any time until the physician determines this is no longer unsafe.Riding in the Bed of a Pickup Truck  In the state of Georgia, it is unlawful for any person under the age of eighteen (18) to ride as a passenger in the uncovered bed of a pickup truck on any interstate highway in the state. DFCS requires that no child be allowed to ride in the bed of a pick-up truck at any time. Other Motorized Vehicles  Due to the potential for serious injury to a child, foster parents are required to take extra precaution when allowing minors to ride as a driver or passenger on the following: motorbikes; all terrain vehicles; small, high-speed water craft, and other similarly motorized vehicles. Any child given permission to drive or ride as a passenger in such vehicles are required to wear appropriate safety gear (i.e., helmet, elbow and knee pads, etc.) as required by the manufacturer.Airbag safety  Children twelve (12) and under are required to ride in the back seat of cars that have installed passenger air bags in the front panel of the car. Air bags can save lives, however, they have become an increasing cause of fatal injury in young children when deployed following impact.Children should ride properly restrained with seat belts in the rear seat of the car. Babies should never be transported in the front seat of the car. Anyone riding in the front seat with a passenger air bag should push the vehicle seat back as far as possible from the dashboard.Visit these websites to obtain additional information on car safety:www.carseat.org www.highwaysafety.org www.nhtsa.dot.gov www.safetyseal.orgPage 60",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-foster-parent-manual-2003-special-issues-foster-parenting-special-safety-issues-motor

The agencys discipline policy is guided by the Consent Decree handed down by the U.S. District Court in 1989(Taylor V. Ledbetter). Physical punishment is defined as any deliberately inflicted pain to the body of the individual. Emotional punishment is any deliberate action toward the child that produces undue fear, anxiety, or feelings of humiliation and degradation. Foster parents in the State of Georgia are required to know the difference between punishment and discipline. Discipline is instructiona standard of behavior, which is maintained consistently and with authority. Punishment is one means of enforcing discipline, usually the least effective means. Discipline is a learning process for children. Discipline should help a child reach a goal of controlling his or her own behavior and acquiring self-discipline. Foster parents may have used some forms of physical and emotional punishment with their own children. We must remember, however, that children reared in an accepting and loving family which is able to meet their needs tolerate punishment in a different way than children removed from their families because of severe neglect and abuse. Children entering foster care usually feel at least one and often all of the following:Negative attention is better than no attention at all. The natural response to frustration, disappointment, anger, etc., is physical or verbal violence. Any form of physical action can lead to severe abuse, creating fear and mistrust. They are not lovable, which is reinforced by physical hurt and verbal demeaning. They are the reason the family is not together and deserve punishment.ACCEPTABLE METHODS OF DISCIPLINETo help you develop acceptable alternatives to punishment, we have listed some guidelines below:Reinforce Acceptable BehaviorExample: Honest praise, special privileges and treats, extra hugs and kisses additional time spent with the child, awards such as stars or smiley faces on a door or bulletin board. Reinforcement should be made immediately and frequently when positive changes (no matter how small) are observed.Use Logical Consequences for the BehaviorExample: If you leave your bike out, you cant ride it tomorrow. If you go in the street, you have to come inside. If you cant get up on time, you will have to go to bed 30 minutes earlier.Criticize the behavior, not the child.When talking with your children, it is helpful to think in terms of you messages and I messages The you message lays blame and conveys criticism of the child. It suggests that the child is at fault. It is simply a verbal attack. In contrast, an I message  simply describes how behavior makes you feel. The message focuses on you, not the child. It reports what you feel. It does not assign blame. Example: I cant hear the television when there is so much noise. I would like to be able to hear it.Loss of PrivilegesExample: Television, telephoning friends, playing with a specific toy. Make this time appropriate according to the childs age; i.e., take the TV away for an hour, not a day.It is more important to use positive reinforcement than punishment to control behavior.GroundingExample: Restricting the child to the house or yard or sending the child out of the room and away from the family activity for a short period time. Be careful to make the time appropriate. Use the latter restriction judiciously, making the child realize the purpose is to help him regain control of his/her behavior.Help Children Deal with and Manage Their Own BehaviorExample: If the child is fighting, have him or her hit a pillow. Explain calmly that to feel angry is ok but that to hurt others or the property of others is not ok. This requires much repetition and practice.Re-Direct the Childs ActivityExample: Suggest a child play with a toy instead of a sharp object.Time-Out from ActivitiesExample: With younger children, sit them in a chair for a few minutes and possibly use a timer so that they can understand the time frame. A good rule of thumb is one minute for every year; i.e., 5 years of age: 5 minutes.SPECIFIC PROBLEM BEHAVIORSIf the child is not being truthful, try to understand the reason and the motivation behind the childs action. Often the child is seeking acceptance, rather than trying to be deceitful. In the case of tantrums, you may need to discuss particular problems with your services worker so that you can work together to try to determine why they occur and what can be done to eliminate them. Tantrums by a child in care may be more destructive in nature than those of your own children.PROHIBITED PRACTICESFoster parents are prohibited from using any of the following practices:Spanking, slapping, switching or hitting a child with your hand or any object; Shaking, pinching or biting;Tying a child with a rope or similar item; Withholding of meals; Denying mail, family visits, telephone contacts with family or activities with the services worker or other department staff; Criticizing the childs family or the childs experiences with the family; Humiliating or degrading punishment which subjects the child to ridicule, such as:Cutting or combing the childs hair for punishment Name calling and public scolding Forcing any child to wear clothing or accessories usually associated with the other sexThreatening a child with removal from the foster home. This creates fear, anger and increased anxiety Locking a child in a room/closet or outside the home Group punishment for the misbehavior of an individual child; Delegating authority for punishment to or allowing punishment by other children or adults; and Destroying the childs property.Any foster home in violation of this policy could be closed, either temporarily or permanently. A Corrective Action Plan will be implemented and the home will be careful monitoring if you are allowed to continue as a foster parent. Note: MAKE THE AGENCY AWARE OF ANY BEHAVIORAL OR PARENTING DIFFICULTIES IMMEDIATELY! IN-HOME, WRAP-AROUND SERVICES TO ADDRESS SUCH PROBLEMS ARE AVAILABLE FOR YOUR SUPPORT.Page 56",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-foster-parent-manual-2003-special-issues-foster-parenting-discipline

The child may feel betrayed or want to know why you cant adopt them. This is an important question and should be answered with as much honesty and clarity as you can provide. This helps to eliminate any uncertainties the child might have (i.e., Am I being moved because I wet the bed or kicked the cat last month?) The child needs the foster parents permission to move on to another family. A firm statement that you are not going to adopt and a clear, empathic statement as to why, is the first step in helping the child to move on. Next you must give the child permission to go with positive and encouraging statements regarding the potential placement. Any feelings of grief or anxiety you may experience regarding the impending separation are perfectly normal, but should not be a barrier to the childs placement.Things you can do to support the childs move to a permanent placement include the following:Come to grips with the fact that the child is moving to a permanent home and that this is in the best interest of the childwhich is what you desire.  Have the Case Manager share as much information with you as possible about the prospective family.  Provide a life book for the child to carry along. Look in the previous section that deals with how to develop a life book for a child.  Write a letter to the prospective parents that details day-to-day information about the child  including routines, habits, favorite foods, favorite toys, school performance, what you have observed as strengths and needs (keeping in mind that these may change when the child achieves stability), etc.  Allow the child to see positive situations of interaction between the prospective parents and yourself, if possible.  Make your help available to the prospective parents. Dont force this. Prospective parents may need to feel a greater sense of security or finality as the childs new parents before sharing the parental role with you.  Talk with other foster parents or the childs Case Manager if you are experiencing any extremely uncomfortable feelings about the prospective parents or your impending separation from the child.  Neatly prepare and pack the childs belongings, sending along favorite books, toys and other personal items.  Provide a formal or an informal activity in recognition of the childs departure from your family circle. Invite significant people whom the child has come to know and care about.Now it is time to let go -- to let the child move on -- and make room in your heart and home for the scores of children who are yet to be nurtured and cared for by you. The time and energy, and the love and nurture youve given a child who leaves your home will never be lost. You have given this child an opportunity to experience a sense of well being in a healthy family environment. The time spent with your family has helped to form bits and pieces of the childs social and emotional development that will have a life long impact. As foster parent, you have provided a place of comfort and safety during a very traumatic time in the childs life.

You will also be given an opportunity to sign off on form 149, Notification to Foster Parents of Intent to Petition for Termination of Parental Rights (see Form 149 in the appendix). If you have an interest in adopting a child who has been in your home over a period of time, and you have been successfully meeting the childs needs, you are an ideal resource for adoption. In this situation, the child gets to remain in a familiar environment that has been both safe and nurturing, and there is no need to uproot the child for yet another move. As foster parents, you have a right to apply, along with other possible resources, to be considered for the adoptive placement of a child in your home. No one has the absolute right to adopt a child in placement, however.You will also have an opportunity to confirm your disinterest in adopting a particular child in your home whose parental rights are scheduled to be terminated. The form 149 has a waiver section for this purpose. The child is placed in a foster/adopt home in a timely man. If you find that you and your family cannot assume permanent custody of a child in your care, you should make this known to the Case Manager as soon as you are made aware of plans to sever parental rights. Take caution not to allow yourself to be pressured into adopting a child whom you feel you are unable to parent on a permanent basis. In fact, there may be more urging and coaxing from the child to adopt rather than the agency. Adoption is a serious and permanent commitment to the life of a child. You will be making someone a permanent member of your family, which includes all of the emotional and legal ramifications involved in being family. In addition, you will have the long-term task of assisting the child with issues relative to adoption. If your hesitancy to adopt involves the lack of financial resources, this can be alleviated with the adoption subsidy. The subsidy is for the maintenance of special needs children in an adoptive placement and is the same dollar amount as the monthly per diem for children receiving regular foster care services at the time of placement. The agency will calculate the amount of monthly adoption subsidy received for children receiving the various Level of Care (LOC) services.

In addition, it is against federal guidelines under MEPA-IEP to maintain separate lists of foster parents based on race or ethnicity. In order to comply with this federal requirement, foster parents may be called on to accept a child of a different race, color or nationality. You are the best judge of your familys strengths and needs in this area as this will affect your familys ability to assure that the best interest of the child is being met. The following pointers may provide some guidelines for parenting children of a different race, color or nationality.Be aware of your familys, including extended family, general feelings and limitations regarding different races and cultures. Provide positive role modeling in regard to your perception and actions toward other races/ethnicities. Become aware of the strengths of the childs racial or ethnic group and the positive contributions they have made to the community and society as a whole.  Be aware that the losses suffered by children (especially school-aged children) who are placed transracially are sometimes compounded through the added loss of being placed with an entire community or neighborhood of people who are much different from that which they are accustomed to. This may also entail the loss of familiar foods, music, traditions, eating patterns and social and religious customs. Allow the child to bring significant personal items along from the previous placement. Be prepared to make some changes in your lifestyle, but not your entire life! Include reading materials (books, magazines, etc.) that reflect the childs race, culture or ethnicity. The public library is an excellent source for obtaining this information. Allow opportunities for the child to make contact with people of his or her own racial or ethnic group. Support the childs contact with the birth family and other significant people in his or her past. Be able to relate to the childs family in support of the agencys plans and goals.Manager, your own family members, teachers, and other community advocates. Demonstrate a willingness to work with the Case Manager or other community representatives in addressing the childs racial, ethnic or cultural needs. Make provisions for the child to practice his own religion if there is a significant difference in religious beliefs. Be willing and able to advocate for the child in situations involving prejudice or racism. Assist the child in developing healthy ways of filtering negative behavior and information that may come from your own extended family members or the community. Develop an understanding of the personal care requirements of the child. Learn about skin and hair care and how to treat various skin and hair problems as scabies, lice, impetigo, etc. Seek information from Case Managers who may be of the same race or ethnicity as the child to learn proper care and maintenance or cultural habits and patterns .  Take stock of your own familys needs and the impact that a transracial placement may have on individual family members and the family as a whole.Additional Pointers for Cross-Racial Parenting (Adapted from Foster Care practice Week Training Curriculum (DHHS, Youth and Families Professional Development Center, Tallahassee, Fla. 1991).Helpful Hints for Foster and Adoptive Parents:Encourage a childs positive self-identity. Discuss culture issues openly and non-judgmentally with the child. Screen TV programs which may contain offensive racial, ethnic language or characters. Select books with culturally diverse children in them. Encourage posters, pictures, etc. that portray members of the childs racial/ethnic/cultural group in a positive light. Refrain from making racial jokes or allowing others to make such jokes in the home.Maintain dolls and toys in the home that represent various races/ethnicities. Locate a responsible mentor who is of the same race/ethnicity as the child. Celebrate the differences between your race and the childs. Attend ethnic festivals, celebrations and other events. Actively demonstrate your respect for the childs race, culture or ethnic group. Learn about the childs racial, cultural and ethnic history and share this knowledge with the child. Share your racial, cultural and ethnic history to promote the childs familiarity and comfort when interacting within your culture. Encourage the child to speak freely about any instances of racial or ethnic discrimination. Educate yourself or seek assistance on how to help your child cope with discrimination and racism. Validate the childs feelings when faced with racial or discriminatory experiences and support his perception of any inappropriate behavior toward him.Page 42",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-foster-parent-manual-2003-meeting-needs-child-parenting-children-other-races-religions

By facing limitations and problems realistically, you can better help the child to handle his or her feelings about being different yet feel lovable and worthwhile. The ability to build on the childs strengths is of the utmost importance. Your familys ability to understand the changes that will occur in your lifestyle and the impact the placement will have on the family  individually and as a whole. Your family must realize its own limitations and, in doing so, must be willing to ask for help when needed. You must be an advocate for your own family as well as the child.When asked to take a child who is mentally or physically challenged, find out as much as you can about the needs of the child and the resources that are available to you for support.

It represents a significant milestone in their maturation and has a significant impact on their sense of identity and self-confidence. For youth that will be emancipated from the foster care program, driving becomes an important step toward making the transition to independence. The responsibilities of driving involve tremendous social as well as legal implications for the youth, the birth parent, the foster parent or other substitute caretaker, and the agency. The deadly consequences of irresponsible and immature driving cannot be overemphasized.Youth in the temporary or permanent custody of DFCS may, under certain conditions, obtain a ""Class D Provisional License"" at age 16-17 or Class C Driver's License if age 18 or older. The following procedures should be followed:The youth must have made satisfactory progress toward the completion of the written Transitional Living Plan. Youth in foster care must be at least 16 years old to drive a motorized vehicle and must have been in care for a minimum of 18 months.There must be some indication that the current placement will last until age 18 and beyond. A valid Georgia Drivers license must be obtained prior to operating a vehicle, with or without an adult present.  If parental rights have not been terminated, the birth parent must give written consent by signing form 9 (Consent for Youth to Drive a Motorized Vehicle) which consents for the youth to obtain a license and/or operate a vehicle. This form also documents the parent(s) understanding of their ultimate responsibility for any liability that occurs. The foster parent or other substitute caretaker must provide written permission for a youth to use their personal vehicle, with the full understanding that their only protection is their own personal insurance. The foster parent must sign form 11 (Acknowledgment of DFCS Driving Policy for Youth in Care) to acknowledge the liability which is assumed when a youth is permitted to drive and that the youth is covered by your policy.Any consideration given to youth operating a motor vehicle should be based on the following criteria:The judgment and maturity of the youth. The completion of a Drivers Education course or quality informal instruction by a mature adult. School performance. The intended use of the vehicle (transportation necessity for school, work, training, etc.)  Previous record of driving offenses. History of runaways or other status offenses. History of substance/alcohol abuse Completion of a driving contract between the foster parent and the youth regarding the general use of the vehicle and any contingencies.

As a foster parent, you will play a major role in deciding whether employment is the appropriate plan for a teen in your home. The youths case manager will assist you in assessing the childs overall situation before the two of you come to a mutual decision in the matter. Whenever possible, the birth parents should be involved in the decision. Use the following questions as a guide in deciding whether employment is appropriate for the teen in your home. Will working interfere with the childs school schedule and completion of his homework? Has the teen generally been responsible in the past?  Will the work hours allow the child adequate rest, recreation, time to complete homework assignments, etc.? Is the work environment conducive to his development? With the feeling of growing independence, will the teen still be willing to be accountable to you and the case manager? How will his being employed affect his Medicaid and IV-E eligibility? If you and the Case Manager decide that employment is feasible for the teen, it will be your responsibility as an ongoing caregiver to watch for positive and negative changes in attitude and behavior and convey these to the Case Manager. The two of you will decide as to the present and future benefits the child will derive from his employment. Having a part-time job will provide a great opportunity for teens to begin learning how to save and budget. Children and youth are expected as a family members to perform routing chores in the home. However, this expectation is not appropriate if the work consumes so much time that the teen is unable to seek employment outside the home.

It provides opportunities for self-expression and aids in the development of a positive self identity through personal achievement. Recreation also provides a positive emotional outlet for children and opportunities to develop such traits as sportsmanship, fairness, cooperation, self-control and others. Foster parents should observe children closely and encourage and support them in their talents and interests. Children should be provided an opportunity, if possible, to participate in activities of interest, such as: dance (ballet, etc.); sports (soccer, etc.); music; art; theatre or other interests. Special events and other outings enjoyed by children may include the following:-circuses -roller skating -picnics -live TV character shows (Barney, etc.) -carnivals -county fairs -sporting events -movies -live concerts (screen for teens) -family reunions -camping -theme parks (Six Flags, White Water, etc.)Children should also be provided the opportunity to visit other local places of interest that may enhance their growth and development. These may include the following:-museum -zoo -planetarium -live play -state capitol -airport -cultural/historical sites -park -library Foster parents should discuss this area with Case Managers to determine the appropriateness of any questionable activities/locations. In some instances, your local DFCS agency or community businesses and organizations may provide access to activities or events at a reduced cost or free of charge. Foster parents or an appropriate adult person should accompany children on outings. With your approval, teens (using the criteria discussed under supervision) may be allowed to attend suitable events alone or with peers. Children can be very resourceful in helping to plan their own leisure time activities. This should be encouraged, and may be used as a special treat or a reward for continued positive behavior. Chores -- Children typically do not maintain a positive attitude about having to perform family chores. However, these and other responsibilities are instrumental in helping the child develop such character traits as dependability, cleanliness, diligence and responsibility. In deciding what chores you will assign the child to complete, your best guide is what you would expect of your own child at the same age and level of maturity, or what should reasonably be expected of a child at that stage of development. Younger children will require some help with their chores. Try to make this a fun experience for them. In some instances, certain chores may be assigned to children in order to challenge or strengthen their capabilities. The assignment of too many challenging tasks, however, will only serve to discourage or anger the child, and should be avoided. Children should never be made to feel that they have to earn their keep. Rather, they should be made to understand that as a member of the family, the responsibilities assigned to them represent their share of the overall family responsibilities in the upkeep and maintenance of the home.  Moral/Spiritual Development -- It is important that children be provided opportunities for moral and spiritual development. However, this should not conflict with the preferences of older children, particularly when there is a significant philosophical difference in religious beliefs, or with birth parents when rights have not been terminated. This can be a very delicate area and should be discussed with the case manager.Beliefs and actions that may be taught and modeled by foster parents, and which may contribute to the moral and spiritual development of children, are commonly found within most religious and spiritual precepts in one form or another, and may include the following: -Self-Respect and Self-Worth -Honesty -Respect for others -Courage -Courtesy -Self-Control -Cheerfulness -Fairness -Kindness -Perseverance -Tolerance -Virtuousness -A Respect for Creation and Creator In addition, opportunities for positive mentoring and character building may be sought through local houses of worship; Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts; Big Brothers and Big Sisters; the Kiwanis Club; Cool Girls; 4-H Clubs; the Junior League; sororities and fraternities; Boys and Girls Clubs; 100 Black Men and other similar social and civic community groups and organizations.Page 32",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-foster-parent-manual-2003-meeting-needs-child-character-development-recreation-chores

Receipts, as defined by the county, are required for reimbursement.  Initial Clothing: Clothing which may be bought within six months of a childs first placement in foster care. A child who moves from one foster home to another is expected to take his wardrobe with him. The maximum allowable amount for initial clothing is determined by State policy.  Annual Clothing: Clothing which may be bought to replenish a childs wardrobe. Annual clothing may not be purchased in the same calendar year in which a child enters care. A child entering care in the year 1999 is not eligible for annual clothing allowance until January 1, 2000. The ideal time to utilize the annual clothing allowance is at the beginning of the school year, if applicable.  Replacement Clothing: Items of clothing that replace worn an outgrown articles may be purchased with portions of the per diem which are allocated for this purpose. Your case manager may assist you in locating resources to replace items of clothing in the childs wardrobe that are no longer serviceable.  Special Clothing: Items of clothing that are not considered to be a part of the normal, day-to-day wardrobe. Special clothing includes Scout uniforms, cheerleader costumes, graduation caps and gowns, costumes for plays, etc. As the availability of funds for special clothing is dependent upon the County DFCS budget, approval from the case manager is required before purchase. A childs clothing is included among his personal belongings and should be taken with him when he is moved to another placement. Clothing that the child has clearly outgrown, but is in good repair, may be saved for other children coming into your home. This, of course, should be done with the agreement of older (school age  or younger for children who are more mature) children who may want to hold on to an item of clothing that has sentimental value.Children should be dressed in clean, serviceable clothing that is appropriate for their size, age, gender and the occasion. Any exception to this would be at the childs request. Nothing shatters a childs self esteem more than being teased by his peers because he is inappropriately dressed.

Unless permanent separation has taken place, voluntarily by the birth parents or by termination of parental rights, it is imperative that the child and his birth parents be allowed regularly planned, monthly visitation, unless ordered more frequently by the court. There is a high correlation between the number of visits between a child and his parents and the successful return of the child to his parents. Monthly visitation with parents is generally ordered by juvenile court. In some instances, the judge may see fit to order more frequent visitations. In either case, foster parents play a major role in seeing that children experience successful visits with birth relatives by preparing them for the visit before hand and following up with them afterwards. It is important that foster parents work along with the childs Case Manager in making visits as easy and natural as possible. The Case Manager usually assumes the primary role in scheduling and coordinating visits based on the case plan developed by the agency and the childs birth parents. A great deal of consideration is given to all persons involved, particularly the foster parents who will be assisting the Case Manager in getting the child to and from visits. This procedure may vary from case to case, however. Depending upon the circumstance, you may be given permission to arrange the childs visits with significant others. In either case, it is important that the Case Manager is involved in the planning.Parent and child visitations usually take place at the DFCS office or some other neutral location and may be supervised or unsupervised. In some instances, foster parents may agree to have the child visit with the parent in their home. This depends largely upon the relationship you have established with the childs birth parents. Again, the Case Manager should be involved in the planning of such visits. Children have a right to visit with their parents and siblings as long as it is determined to be in their best interest. It is wise to remember that a childs birth parents are his own. He cannot, in most instances, forget them entirely. Even if they will never make a home for him, a childs parents are important to him. Your greatest service to a child would be to encourage and support his faith in his birth parents. This approach forms a healthy basis for future relationships, including the childs relationship with you. The child should be made to feel that it is acceptable to talk about his birth parents following visitations, or at any other time for that matter. If talk is negative, it is not necessary to agree or disagree. Focus on the childs feelings and provide feedback by helping the child isolate or identify his feelings and providing validation. You may contact the Case Manager if what the child is saying about the parent or his display of emotions give rise to concerns. (See the lists of rights for the child and the rights and responsibilities of the birth parent, the foster parent and the agency for additional pointers surrounding visitation.)Page 23",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-foster-parent-manual-2003-meeting-needs-child-your-home-visitation

The Child Protective Services standards regarding the supervision of children are not applicable to children in placement. As foster parents, your parental responsibilities require a higher standard of conduct than that of the birth family from whom the child has been removed. This is the primary basis for the pre-service and Continued Parent Development training for foster families. A well-trained foster parent, in actuality, is a professional parent. Supervision is provided or arranged by the foster parent based on each childs age, condition and individual needs. When the foster parent is away from the home due to employment, training, or personal situations, a plan for the provision of substitute care by a competent and reliable person is put into place. In addition, foster parents must assure that any substitute caregiver is able to manage the parenting needs of the child left in their care. Any substitute caretaker must be made aware of and agree to follow agency guidelines regarding supervision, discipline and the safety needs of children in placement. Generally speaking, reliable youth may be left under their own supervision under certain circumstances for reasonable periods of time so as not to jeopardize their safety and wellbeing. At this stage in their lives, many youth in care are engaged in activities and processes that lead to their emancipation. Among these are experiences that foster independence and self-control. Situations requiring youth to be home alone after school hours or during the foster parent's business or personal appointments are acceptable within the limitations indicated. Primary factors to consider in determining if a teen in care should be left alone are age and level of maturity. Other factors include the following:¦ Judgment and level of maturity, development or mental capacity. ¦ Demonstration of dependability, responsibility and trustworthiness.¦ History of emotional/psychological stability. ¦ History of run-aways and other status offenses. ¦ History of alcohol and substance abuse. ¦ The number of youth in the home involved and their relationship with each other. ¦ Safety of the home environment (firearm safety, water safety, etc.) ¦ Youths ability to easily access the foster parent or other reliable adult.Foster parents are required to consult with Case Managers as well as employ their own best judgment in determining whether a particular youth may be left in the home unsupervised.Page 22",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-foster-parent-manual-2003-meeting-needs-child-your-home-supervision-child-care

An important point to remember is that the childs transition into your home will be made easier if you do not take his behavior personally. Additional points to remember when a child is initially placed into your home. Be patient; dont expect miracles.  The child is attempting to make some sense of new people, new surroundings, and behaviors that are different from what he is accustomed to.  No matter how terrible the previous situation was, the child will probably display some sadness and anxiety due to his loss.  The child may be unclean and poorly dressed with little, if any, clothing, or the child may be appropriately dressed with an adequate wardrobe. No matter what the childs condition, do not immediately discard his clothing and other personal possessions. They have special meaning to the child.

A few of these include 1) the overall number of children in your area needing placement at the time and, 2) the age range, gender, and characteristics of the children you have been approved to provide foster care for. The second factor is based primarily on a mutual decision between you and DFCS regarding the type child whose needs you have stated you can meet and the level of parenting for which your home has been approved (basic care, level of care, medically fragile, etc.). If circumstances allow, the Case Manager will plan the childs placement with you in advance. In many instances, particularly after working hours, a child will be placed following only a brief call from the agency or the emergency placement person regarding the childs general circumstances. Regardless to whether the placement is planned or unplanned, the childs case manager should share with foster parents all applicable information available regarding the child and his situation. Types of information that may be shared with you when a child is initially placed in your home include the following:  Form 469, Child Information Sheet. This form contains personal information about the child. Circumstances surrounding the childs placement in care.  The childs placement history, if previously placed.  Grade level, achievement level, and educational experiences and adjustment.  Previous experiences with parents or other caretakers.  Behavior patterns with parents, caretakers, or significant others.  Medical history and any specific needs.  Eating and sleeping patterns.  Information regarding siblings or other significant persons in the childs past.  Special instructions (dietary restrictions, medical needs, emotional needs, etc.) You and the Case Manager also sign the Agreement Supplement, Form 40, at the time of the childs placement. The Agreement Supplement provides you and the agency with a record of the beginning and ending dates of each childs placement in your home. The fundamental responsibility for the child placed in your home rests with the agency. The agency must do everything in its power to promote, protect and safeguard the welfare of the child. The Case Manager must assure that the placement is appropriate to meet the needs of the individual child and that the child receives proper care while in placement. The Case Manager must also work to improve conditions in the childs home so that, if possible, he may return there. The Case Manager must ensure that the rights and responsibilities of the child, the birth parent and the foster parents are respected and fulfilled. The Case Manager must also maintain continued supervision of the child while he is living in the foster home. As a valued member of the foster care team, your perceptions of what is in the best interest of the child are important. You will be involved in planning for the child in preparation for case reviews held every six months for the duration of the placement.Page 18",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-foster-parent-manual-2003-placement-process-placement-child-your-home

The time, place, number of visits and the persons involved will depend upon the circumstances in each case.Steps you can take to help the pre-placement visits run smoothly include the following:  If the child is in the hospital, you should visit him there.  When the visits take place at the foster parents home it is always helpful to have only your household members present.  Have available, pictures of family members who are not present.  Have a light snack prepared for the child.  Show the child his room and the area where his personal belongings will be kept.  Discuss with the child where he will attend school. All of the above pointers will help the child feel better about his temporary home.

There are feelings of fear, hope, anxiety, joy, anticipation and grief  all the emotions that any other human being would experience under similar circumstances. Simultaneously, the child has a need to be nurtured, accepted, challenged and to view himself as a worthwhile person. In order to support the needs of children in care, foster parents must be aware of the various rights of children that contribute toward the fulfillment of such needs. Some of the childs rights while placed in your home include the following:  The right to grieve for his family. No matter what has happened to him, a child usually cares for his family. He does not forget them due to the circumstances and, in the majority of cases, would like to return to them.  The right not to have his birth family criticized by the foster parent. There probably will be times when the child will want to talk with you about his family. What he says may be truthful or it may be fantasy, and it may be difficult for you to know exactly how to respond to him. Never say anything critical about the childs parents. Draw attention to the feelings that the child is experiencing at the moment, not to what he is saying.  The right to visit with his parents, siblings and other significant persons in his life, unless otherwise ordered by the court or the childs safety is at risk. The case manager will arrange visits and will always try to be considerate of the child, the birth family and the foster family.  The right to be angry or upset. Think about his dilemma for a moment. He has been taken from what he knows, loves, and believes to be a part of himself, and placed into a new environment with total strangers. The child has been forced into a situation that renders him a helpless victim.  The right to privacy  privacy of person, privacy of place, privacy of things. This is a basic right of any child or adult. The child has a right to be quiet and alone sometimes so he can think without disturbances. There needs to be a place in the home where he can go for privacy and where his belongings are respected.  The right to receive unopened mail addressed to him, unless prohibited by a court order, case plan or consensual agreement between the foster parent and the childs Case Manager. The right to be complimented on any improvement in his development  physical, social or emotional. Constructive criticism may be helpful, but praise, when due, can work magic.  The right to continued and private contact with the Case Manager.  The right to be cherished by a family of his own, either his family, aided by readily available services and supports to resume care, a foster family, or an adoptive family.  The right to receive sensitive, continuing help in understanding and accepting the reasons for his own familys inability to take care of him, and in developing confidence in his own self-worth.  The right to receive continuing, loving care and respect as a unique human being¦a child growing in trust in himself and others.  The right to grow up in freedom and dignity in a neighborhood of people who accept him with understanding, respect and friendship.  The right to receive help in overcoming deprivation or whatever distortion in his emotional, physical, social, intellectual and spiritual growth may have resulted from his experiences; the right to receive a healthy preparation for citizenship and parenthood.  The right to representation by a competent attorney in administrative or judicial proceedings so that his best interests are safeguarded. Page 16",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-foster-parent-manual-2003-guidelines-positive-foster-parenting-outcomes-rights-child

While the agency has the legal right to give consent for the routine medical care of the child in foster care, the birth parent has the right to appeal decisions of the agency or the court, and has the right to grant permission for major nonemergency surgery prior to the termination of their rights.  Review legally permitted portions of the case record pertaining to them and their child(ren).  Request a court hearing when in disagreement with the case plan.  Înformation on how to obtain confidential information about the child not available from DFCS.  Petition the court at any time for the return of custody prior to termination of parental rights.Responsibilities While the court may have suspended some of the rights of the birth parents, they retain certain distinct responsibilities. The birth parents are obligated to:  Recognize that there are specific reasons why the court removed the child from their care. They must understand the reasons and what they must do to change the current situation to allow the child to be returned to their care.  Cooperate with the Case Plan and work toward solutions to the existing problems.

This responsibility includes cooperation in all phases of the recommended foster care plan.  Assume financial responsibility for the care and treatment of the child by reasonable and conscientious reimbursement for expenditures. The parent must realize that their legal responsibility for support of the child remains unless all parental rights are terminated. Their lack of ability or willingness to treat the childs problems does not automatically transfer the cost of treatment to the county or the state. The birth parents own personal funds or medical insurance, if any, should be utilized.  Understand that foster parents are a very important part of the care and/or treatment program. The birth parent must recognize that foster parents are not purposely alienating or keeping the child from them, but are giving freely of themselves in an attempt to fill a gap in the childs life. Some of the specific areas in which birth parents should be involved, when possible, are: baptism or confirmation; marriage plans; burial plans, if needed; elective surgery; major alterations in the childs appearance, including body piercing, etc.; enlistment in the Armed Services.Page 12",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-foster-parent-manual-2003-guidelines-positive-foster-parenting-outcomes-rights-and

A re-evaluation of your home can occur before the end of the one-year period if there is reasonable cause. The need to re-evaluate your home prior to the scheduled annual renewal of approval may occur for either or a combination of the following reasons: A discipline or foster care policy violation.  The relocation to a new residence.  Chronic, inappropriate care and maintenance of children placed.  Marriage, divorce or other major life event.  Any major change in the household (i.e., other family members having to move in, etc.)The re-evaluation of your foster home is a joint process that involves you and the assigned Case Manager reviewing the successful outcomes and challenges of the previous year.

The training must relate to the skills required in the day-to-day parenting of children in care. The minimum number of hours currently required is 15. This number may increase due to additional state and/or federal requirements. Additional training may also be necessary for foster parents providing more specialized care. A waiver of DFCS training requirements can only be granted by the County Director or someone else in the department who has been designated that authority. Several important points should be mentioned; Continued parent development requirements can only be waived for extenuating circumstances in the foster family such as serious illness or major family crisis  The waiver is for a specified period of time only. Parent Development or in-service training must be completed each year as noted above; therefore, if you have not completed the required 15 hours of training at the end of the calendar year, your home will lose full approval status. This impacts the childs IV-E eligibility (federal funding).If children are currently being served in the home, a waiver to maintain the home in approved status, with specific time frames for completing training and any other requirements, will be necessary in order for the home to continue to receive per diem payments. Federal law provides that children must be in an approved foster home to receive certain foster care per diem funds. When a child is not in an approved foster home, an additional financial burden is placed on the State to cover the per diem cost. This greatly limits the agencys options in maintaining homes that are not in approved status, even temporarily. The failure or refusal of a relative or non-relative foster parent to complete the annual training requirements will be carefully assessed by the agency. With more stringent Federal requirements now in effect, the failure to meet State training requirements will result in the closure of the foster home.Note: For additional guidelines regarding continued parent development training requirements, see Appendix K. Page 7",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-foster-parent-manual-2003-guidelines-positive-foster-parenting-outcomes-ensuring

The Georgia Department of Human Resources (DHR) is designated by law as the agency to develop and administer the States Foster Care Program. The department develops standards for the States public and private child placing agencies through the Division of Family and Children Services and the Office of Regulatory Services. Non-public (private) agencies providing foster care services are licensed by DHR through the Office of Regulatory Services. Such non-public agencies include: Families First, United Methodist Childrens Home, Palmetto Campus of Georgia Baptist Childrens Home, AGAPE, Extended Families, Lutheran Ministries, Child Kind and others. DHR also administers a program of foster care services through its public agencies: the Division of Family and Children Services and the Division of Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Substance Abuse. The Division of Family and Children Services implements its programs through case managers in county DFCS agencies who share with you, the foster parent, the responsibility for the care and maintenance of the child placed in your home. In most instances, the county departments derive the authority to place and maintain children in foster care through a series of orders handed down by local courts, primarily juvenile. These orders give the department temporary custody, or at some point permanent custody, by terminating parental rights. An initial order giving temporary custody is in effect no longer than twelve months. At this time a Permanency Hearing is held for the purpose of extending custody, if required, and finalizing the permanency plan for the child. Throughout the duration of the court order, the County DFCS agency acts as legal custodian. The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (Public Law 1aw 105-89) has established strong national goals for children in our nations child welfare system. These goals are safety, permanence and well-being. You will find as you review the new Foster Parent Manual, changes in our states foster care policy and practice that emphasize the safety and health of children as being of paramount concern in providing services. Page 3",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-foster-parent-manual-2003-legal-bases-foster-care

The child will remain in a familiar environment that has been both safe and nurturing and will not have to face the challenges of yet another move. As foster parents, you have a right to be considered as an adoptive resource when there are no viable relatives and the plan is adoption. If you and your family are not prepared to adopt the child in your care, you should make this known to your case manager as soon as you are made aware of plans to dissolve parental rights. Take caution not to allow yourself to be pressured into adopting a child whom you feel you are unable to parent on a permanent basis. In fact, there may be more urging and coaxing from the child to adopt than from the agency. Adoption is a serious and permanent commitment to the life of the child and to the status of your family. You will be making someone a permanent member of your family, which includes all the emotional and legal ramifications involved with being a family. In addition, you will have the long-term task of assisting the child with issues relative to adoption. Therefore, a foster parent must assess his or her capacity to permanently adopt the child into his or her family as well as to care for the long term physical and emotional needs of the child when making this life-altering decision.Page 72",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-foster-parent-manual-2017-adopting-your-foster-child-intro

Thoughtful consideration prior to accepting a placement is paramount in preventing a disruption in the childs care, including pre-service training and assuring an appropriate match with your family by receiving comprehensive information about the child to be placed. Once a child is placed in your home, appropriate behavior management will be essential in helping him or her to adjust to your home and family and remain with you until a permanent placement occurs. Keep a journal as an informational tool. A short, daily, written observation of the childs needs and behaviors can illustrate challenges and progress. At the first sign of concern, contact your Resource Development case manager for guidance. There is no need to wait until you are exhausted and the child is distressed.Seek strength in numbers  Talk with your case manager and seek support from other partners on the foster care team who have experienced similar problems Sort out the facts  What you are experiencing may be quite normal; learn what expected behaviors are for specific ages Look for patterns  Refer to the childs family background and placement history to help determine what may be the root of the current problem Keep a log of significant occurrences  This is especially helpful to share with professionals from whom you are seeking guidance; include details such as when something happens, how often, the intensity level, etc. Request wraparound services Be the parent  Be assertive, when necessary, to obtain other resources and outside assistance, advocating for the child and your familyUsing your skills, strengths, and supports to analyze a problem and plan an intervention is a process for fixing the responses to undesirable behavior, rather than fixing the child. Dont blame the child or yourself  get information and help right away! If all attempts to support and strengthen the placement are unsuccessful, your case manager will plan to transition the child to another placement. Your support throughout this process is critical in helping the child make the necessary adjustments so that he or she will be able to move to a new foster home in the least disruptive way.Page 65",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-foster-parent-manual-2017-effectively-handling-placement-disruptions

The primary purposes of the national and state foster parent associations are to improve the circumstances of children in foster care, to assist in DFCSs efforts to incorporate foster parents as team members, and to advocate both for children in care and foster parents -- and in many instances, for the agency. While interacting in groups, foster parents provide one another with invaluable support and new insights into caring for children in placement, all centered on what is in the best interest of the child. AFPAG, along with local child service organizations, associations, and advocates, has been instrumental in the development and implementation of beneficial DFCS policy changes. Examples include revisions to the foster parent grievance procedure, training requirements, smoke detector and fire safety policies, state reimbursement for foster child funeral expenses, practices related to the removal of children from foster homes, school clothing for kindergarten children, the participation of foster parents in reviews, and the development of a Foster Child Information Sheet (Appendix B). Local associations have been successful in planning and providing excellent regional training sessions. The AFPAG plans and makes all arrangements for an annual statewide educational training conference.

The following must be accomplished within the (15) fifteen working day timeframe: 1) Acknowledge receipt of the grievance using Form81; 2) Investigate the grievance; 3) Facilitate a staffing with the County Director, supervisor, case manager, foster parent, AFPAG advocate (if requested) and any other pertinent staff present unless the grievance can be successfully resolved without it; and 4) Send a written response indicating the resolution or decision reached.  Under no circumstances shall the county department take more than fifteen(15) working days to resolve the problem unless good cause can be shown as to why it would take longer, in which case the county department must send the foster parent a letter, which specifies a date by which the county expects to resolve the issue If the complaint is not resolved within fifteen (15) working days from the date the complaint was received by the county department, OR the foster parent does not feel that there was a timely response OR a satisfactory resolution, then the foster parent can send the complaint to the State DFCS Division Director or his/her designee for resolution*The first day is the next business day after receipt of the grievance.

Through the course of strengthening our partnership and working together to support children and families, conflicts unfortunately may arise that threaten to deteriorate our established relationships. These differences, if left unsettled, have the potential to negatively impact the quality of service provided. We encourage all caregivers to reach out to their local DFCS County offices first to attempt resolution, in an effort to preserve and strengthen the partnerships with the local county staff and leadership. When such informal attempts to resolve the matter are unsuccessful, each foster parent has the right to file a grievance when he/she has an irreconcilable difference.Timely responsiveness is paramount to good customer service. Mandated timeframes have been established to ensure foster parents have a clear expectation of when their concerns will be addressed. By implementation of this policy, foster parents have the right to file complaints and discuss concerns with County Directors, the foster parent liaison, the DFCS staff liaison, supervisors, case managers, advocates appointed by the Adoptive and Foster Parent Association of Georgia, the Office of the Child Advocate, or the State Mediation Committee, without being considered in violation of the rules of confidentiality. Care should always be taken to mention only case situations, not case names. Care should also be taken to avoid discussion with other individuals not listed above as this might be considered to be in violation of the rules of confidentiality.Foster parents should never feel alone in the process of filing a complaint. DFCS is required to ensure that every source of support for the foster parent is arranged. The foster parent can request assistance from the local county department liaison and the Office of the Child Advocate. Additionally, the Adoptive and Foster Parent Association of Georgia provides trained advocates to assist and support foster parents throughout the process. Foster parents can contact the Adoptive and Foster Parent Association of Georgia at 1-877-804-6610 or at www.afpag.net to make an advocate request.NOTE: Foster parents may choose not to have an AFPAG advocate, but rather a personal support person of their choosing. These individuals are not provided the same access to confidential information, and will belimited to portions of the grievance process which does not violate confidentiality laws.Actions taken by the Department when a complaint is filed should never be retaliatory/punitive in nature. No person who files a grievance, complaint, or concern will be punished, discriminated against, threatened, or retaliated against in any way for filing such action. Caution should be taken to prevent this from becoming the agency vs. the foster parent situation. Foster parents are partners in the planning for children and have every right to have their opinions and concerns heard as well as the right to be considered as a valuable part of the professional treatment team. To read the State of Georgias complete Foster Parent Bill of Rights and the grievance procedure process, please refer to Appendix C. Page 13",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-foster-parent-manual-2017-qualities-being-successful-foster-parent-foster-parent-0

Partnership parents work in partnership with birth families and act as parenting mentors whenever possible. Partnership parents share parenting responsibilities with birth parents through parenting opportunities. Parenting opportunities are any favorable times, occasions, situations, or conditions which allow a parent to safely teach, support, nurture, discipline, care for, or guide his or her child.Relative Partnership Parents (RPP)Relative partnership parents (RPPs) are those related by blood, marriage, or adoption to the children placed in their home. RPPs provide a temporary home for a relatives child who is presently in foster care. RPPs may also care for non-relative children. RPPs follow the same approval process as regular partnership parents, including all the benefits and responsibilities of a partnership parent, including full foster care per diem reimbursement. RPPs have the same expectations as partnership parents.Adoptive Parents (AP) Adoptive parents (APs) create a forever family by making a lifelong commitment to a child whose birth parents legal parental rights have been voluntarily surrendered or terminated by a court, thus making the child legally free for adoption. Relative Adoptive Parents (RAP) Relative adoptive parents (RAPs) are relatives of and can legally adopt the child. Legal Risk Adoptive Parents Legal risk adoptive parents are those who accept a child for placement who is not 100% legally free to be adopted; therefore, legal risk exists in accepting this placement.Resource Parents (RP) Resource parents (RPs) are foster parents who are willing to become adoptive parents to the child being cared for. Children placed with RPs have a concurrent permanency plan, meaning that two permanency goals (reunification and adoption) are being evaluated simultaneously. The resource parent is named as the permanency resource and must concurrently fulfill the roles of partnership parent and potential adoptive parent. If a resource parent is a relative partnership parent, he or she is known as a relative resource parent (RRP). Page 11",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-foster-parent-manual-2017-partnership-parenting-model-partnership-parenting-model

The assessment process is ongoing and involves gathering facts, observations, and information about and from the family, both immediate and extended. Insight is gained about how family members think, feel, behave, relate to one another, and respond to various situations, including the removal of the child. A child entering foster care is at higher risk than the general population for developmental delays and/or disabilities. In addition, the shock of out of home placement for the child can result in significant emotional distress and trauma. Consequently, a comprehensive assessment of the child and his or her family can have a powerful life changing impact if problems are identified and early treatment interventions are implemented. This assessment will serve as the foundation for the childs case plan, future case planning decisions, and for making recommendations to the juvenile court. Assessment outcomes will guide staff in making sound decisions about the best placement for the child, the critical service needs of the child and his or her family, and the most viable path for achieving permanency. Initially, the assessment provides useful information for determining the likelihood of reunification, the preferred method for achieving permanency when the long-term safety of the child can be assured. The assessment includes family-centered approaches such as family team meetings and multi-disciplinary team staffing to ensure family involvement in the planning and decision making being done on behalf of the child.Information gathered to compile the Comprehensive Child and Family Assessment will include:  The level of parent-child attachment, including where the child feels a sense of belonging  The childs extended family as a possible resource for support and/or placement of the child  Family history and patterns of behavior, for example, previous CPS involvement or out of-home placements, prior experience handling crisis situations, problems with addiction/substance abuse, or criminal behavior, among others  Family strengths and resources that the family can apply  The core needs of the family that, at a minimum, must be changed or corrected for the child to be safely returned within a reasonable period The probability of the child returning to his or her home or the likelihood of an alternative permanency plan  Identification of the medical, emotional, social, educational, and placement-related needs of the child Page 10",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/ga-foster-parent-manual-2017-why-child-comes-foster-care-comprehensive-child-and-family
