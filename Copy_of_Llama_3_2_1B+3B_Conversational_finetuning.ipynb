            "Content: CODES/REFERENCESPublic Law 96-272Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 Public Law 105-89DISCUSSIONOverviewFoster care is the temporary out of home care for children who cannot live with their families primarily due to safety threats within their own home. The Division of Family and Children Servicesô (DFCS) Foster Care Program through partnership with the family, caregivers, court and other stakeholders provides support and strengthen families, protect children from further child abuse, and support every child having a permanent family.†GOALSEnsure the safety and well-being of children in care;Enhance caregiver protective capacities so caregivers are able to ensure the safety and well-being of their children;Preserve family relationships and connections for children;Promote expedited permanency for children in foster care by:†Assessing the needs of the child, the family and the foster care givers utilizing a trauma-informed approach;Ensuring the safety, stability and security of children;Supporting families;Prioritizing placement with kinship caregivers.Partnering with families to identify solutions and achieve needed changes in their behavior and/or circumstances;Providing services and supports to children and families address the reason for foster care and to prevent reentry into care;Supporting caregivers to meet the needs of children in their care.Minimizing placement disruptions;Meeting the unique developmental needs of children from birth to five years of age;Addressing the needs of youth and young adults to ensure their successful transition to adulthood.†Safety, Permanency, and Well-beingFederal Law establishes provisions for reasonable efforts to preserve and reunify families when children must enter foster care. In addition, there are established safety, permanency and wellbeing outcomes for children† in foster care.† Both federal and† state law specifycompressed time frames for judicial reviews and decisions that are intended to move children quickly through the child welfare system to permanency. Georgiaôs child welfare practice remains mindful of these factors when working with families to establish case plan outcomes, provide appropriate services, and make permanency decisions. As a result, it is anticipated that children will spend less time in foster care and will experience fewer placement disruptions. Notwithstanding, DFCS must work in tandem with the judicial system and with community partners to achieve safety, permanency and well-being for children in foster care.†Children require a variety of services to promote their health, well-being and safety. Due to the trauma experienced by children who enter foster care, many of them will have one or more needs that require immediate attention and sometimes ongoing care and treatment. Foster care provides an opportunity to conduct a comprehensive trauma-informed assessment of each childôs needs and respond to those needs through a combination of short and long-term interventions. Exposure to intensely traumatic events may require ongoing treatment after a child exits foster care. Consequently, case managers must be knowledgeable and resourceful in developing and utilizing resources to enable children to achieve the highest level of functioning possible to support successful permanency outcomes.†ResponsibilitiesWhile their child is in foster care, parents/guardians/legal custodians have the responsibility to:Collaborate with DFCS in developing written case plans, including concurrent permanency plans to support timely permanency outcomes for their child.Partner with DFCS to mitigate safety threats which led to the removal of the child from the home;Actively participate in services aimed at making behavioral changes and improving family conditions that can support the child return home.Maintain contact with their children through regular, consistent visitation;Inform the DFCS Social Services Case Manager (SSCM) about significant changes, such as a change of address, telephone number, job, income, health or marriage circumstances, as well as changes in relationships, household composition (including unrelated adults), etc.;Actively participate in planning for their children at court hearings, periodic reviews and meetings with local DFCS staff, etc.; andPay child support on behalf of their children in care, including medical coverage (if available to the parent).†DFCS has the responsibility to:Ensure the safety and wellbeing of each child in care;Treat parents/guardians/legal custodian, children and their caregivers with dignity and respect;Provide excellent customer service;Assist each parents/guardians/legal custodian in understanding the seriousness of foster care and the childôs need for permanency within 12 months of entering care; Inform the parent that parental rights could be terminated should reunification not occur in an expeditious manner;Participate with the parents/guardians/legal custodian in developing written case plans designed to achieve permanency for their child;Provide services to parents/guardians/legal custodian to enhance diminished protective capacity that necessitated foster care;Arrange regular visits between the parents/guardians/legal custodian and their child;Preserve sibling connections with children in care when they are not placed together;Share information with the parents/guardians/legal custodian about the childôs well- being and experiences during placement;Inform the parents/guardians/legal custodian of placement changes and any major illnesses of the child; Make every effort to contact the parent prior to the child undergoing surgery;Partner with families during action planning and through the development of problem- solving skills;Conduct diligent searches in partnership with the family to identify absent parents and kin to serve as caregivers or other supports to the family.Partner with parents/guardians/legal custodian in planning for the child by having regularly scheduled meetings;Partner with the community to support families;Reinforce progress and celebrate accomplishments with families;Recommend the child be returned to the parents/guardians/legal custodian when the circumstances which made foster care placement necessary have been ameliorated to the point where the child will be safe in the home; andEnter and update all case information in Georgia SHINES to assure effective tracking of all children in foster care.\n",

            "Content: The Department of Human Resources, Division of Family and Children Services, strongly supports and encourages the formation of foster parent organizations throughout the state. The purpose of local organizations vary according to the decisions of the membership, but, generally, conform to the goals of the National Foster Parent Association and the Adoptive and Foster Parent Association of Georgia (AFPAG). The primary purposes of the National and State Foster Parent Associations are to improve the circumstances of children in foster care, to assist in the Divisionôs efforts to incorporate foster parents as team members and to advocate both for children in care and foster parents -- and in many instances, for the agency.†While interacting in groups, foster parents provide one another with invaluable support and new insights into caring for children in placement. The personality conflicts and differences of opinion which always occur when people congregate are managed when the question úwhich action will prove to be in the best interest of the child in care?ù is resolved. Issues primarily related to 1) support services for children and families and, 2) support and training for foster parents and foster care workers are all current in both the state and local organizations.†In addition, AFPAG and the local associations have been instrumental in the development and implementation of some DFCS policy changes. Examples include the development of and revisions to the foster parent grievance procedure, training requirements, the smoke alarm requirement, state reimbursement for foster children funeral expenses, practices related to the removal of children from foster homes, school clothing for kindergarten children, the participation of foster parents in reviews and the development of form 469, Foster Child Information Sheet. Some association have been successful in planning and providing excellent regional training sessions. The AFPAG plans and makes all arrangements for an annual statewide educational training conference. The most effective associations work closely with their County DFCS offices. While the AFPAG will assist and support the local associations, they are totally autonomous and develop their own guidelines.Foster parent organizations can prove to be a very important component in our joint efforts to attain goals for children in our care and in improving the foster care system. If there is no organization in your community, your state association or your county agency will assist you in forming one. Assistance is also available from foster care consultants in the state office and from those foster parents representing your area on the AFPAG Board.Page 73\n",

            "Content: BILL OF RIGHTS†The Foster Parent Bill of Rights became law on July 1, 2004 and outlines 23 rights for DFCS foster parents. The law (O.C.G.A. covers issues such as non-discrimination, distribution and disclosure of information, financial reimbursement, and the right to have input into case planning for children. It includes a provision for advocates who can provide support to foster parents during child protective services investigations or through the grievance process. The Bill of Rights also allows for foster parents to file grievances when they believe that any of these rights have been violated.†Besides partnering with DFCS and Foster Care Team members, there are two major organizations that provide support to Foster and Adoptive parents in the state of Georgia. The Adoptive and Foster Parent Association of Georgia (AFPAG) and the Georgia Center for Resources and Support provide ongoing training and advocacy to foster and adoptive parents. Their websites provide contact information and a wealth of resources for foster and adoptive parents. (www.AFPAG.net and www.gaadoptionresources.org).†The Division of Family and Children Services (DFCS) and Child Placing Agencies (CPAs) are expected to comply with mandates contained in the Foster Parent Bill of Rights and Grievance Procedure. Foster parents have the following rights, which are subject to the grievance procedure later addressed in the manual:†1. The right to be treated by DFCS and other partners in the care of abused children with dignity, respect, and trust as a primary provider of foster care and a member of the professional team caring for children in foster care;†2.

            "Content: DFCS Placement staff are responsible for assessing the following allegations involving foster homes:Discipline policy violations.†Violations of Foster Care policy requirements.Any foster home that is the subject of a report alleging discipline policy violations, or other violations of foster care policy, will be assessed by a Placement Case Manager and referred back to CPS should there be any suspicion of abuse or neglect of a child placed in the home. The stateôs policy regarding the discipline of children in care emanated from the much heralded case that was decided in the United States District Court -- Taylor v. Ledbetter.Kathy Jo Taylor was a child injured while living in an agency foster home. Her guardian ad litem filed suit against the Department of Human Resources and the case was settled in the United Stated District Court on October 6, 1989. The two general provisions of this consent order as it relates to CPS are as follows:The improper punishment of children in foster care is prohibited. (See úprohibited practicesù under the Discipline heading in this manual)†The investigation of and response to alleged incidents of unsuitable care or abuse and neglect shall occur immediately (within 24 hours of receipt of referral by foster care supervisor) to ensure the continued safety of the child in the foster home placement.The assessment of a foster home resulting from allegations of discipline or other foster care policy infractions may experience any or all of the following consequences:Removal of the child(ren)†A CPS investigation†Corrective Action Plan and Interview†Closure of the home†Criminal prosecutionThe following guidelines are generally followed following a report of discipline and other foster care policy violations.If the assessment confirms an initial violation of the discipline or other foster care policy, a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) may be initiated by a Placement staff person to insure the problem is addressed and a solution underway.†The CAP is reviewed with the foster parents by the case Manager in a positive manner, with the added explanation that there is no CPS activity in the case. A part of the CAP includes re-teaching and support to the foster parent in effecting change in their implementation of discipline or other foster care policy issues.†The CAP is signed by the Case Manager implementing the plan and the foster parents involved. A copy is given to the foster parents and a DFCS copy is filed in the foster home record.The foster home is closely monitored for a stated period of time to assure that the requirements of the CAP are completed.†Foster parents are allowed only one violation of the discipline policy. However, if a second violation occurs outside a three-year period, the home may remain open based on the circumstances and at the agency's discretion. In those instances where the CPS investigation or the assessment for discipline policy violations are not substantiated, serious consideration may still be given to home closure if other serious concerns are noted.†When it is necessary to relocate children due to discipline policy violations, the ten-day notification to a foster family that a child is being removed from the home is waived.The ultimate decision on closure of a foster home because of a violation of foster care policy rests with the County Director. In reaching this decision, the County Director considers factors such as the severity of the incident, the patterns and parenting history demonstrated by the foster parents, the personality of the child involved, the willingness of the foster parents to look at alternative approaches to correct the problem or change the undesirable behavior; (i.e., training or counseling), and the quality of the relationship between the foster parents and the child.Violation of the discipline policy and the decisions made are not subject to appeal at the state level. Decisions made as a result of Child Protective Services investigations are not grievable under the Foster Parent Grievance Procedures. Even though a CPS investigation may not be substantiated, the foster home may still be closed as a result of issues/concerns arising from the investigation.Page 74\n",
