If the decision is made that therapeutic foster care (TFC) can best meet the child’s clinical needs, referrals to the TFC program shall follow these guidelines: The case manager must assess the child’s need, via completion of the Residential and Specialized Placement Referral (CS-9), for therapeutic foster care. If other services are needed, involve the Department of Mental Health (DMH): Division of Comprehensive Psychiatric Services (CPS)/Division of Developmental Disabilities (DDD) at this time to maximize interagency expertise and financial participation. The FST shall assess the child’s needs and devise the treatment plan: Because placement should always be in the least restrictive setting, efforts should be made to place a child with a relative home, traditional foster home, or an elevated needs home prior to referral to TFC. Collateral documentation of behavior or other factors that indicate a need for therapeutic foster care services should be provided. The treatment plan must include strategies to allow for the child to remain “connected” to his/her family, kin, community, etc. Connection to the community must be an integral part of the treatment plan for older youth who have a permanency plan of independent living. Submit the following materials to the RCST Coordinator when the child has met the above criteria. The family, community members, or others who know the child can help with providing this material: Completed CS-9 that includes the CSPI: Social history or psychosocial assessment or court assessment completed within last 60 days Current case plan (CS-1) Current school report/grade level and any applicable records. For children with special education requirements, current Individualized Education Plan (IEP) and educational diagnostic assessment Medical history Immunization record Court orders and petitions Criminal history Psychological/psychiatric evaluation, and For any youth age 16 and over, include CS-3 Life Skills Inventory, Daniel Memorial Life Skills Inventory, or CS-1 Attachment. The case manager, supervisor, and RCST Coordinator will share information about the referral, discussion of possible placement resources, the urgency of need for placement, and other relevant information. The RCST Coordinator will screen the referral and, if appropriate, will notify the case manager by email if the child is approved for TFC.  The case manager shall begin the process of identifying a TFC placement. Once a TFC home is identified the case manager will notify the RCST.   The RCST will determine the initial treatment period, not to exceed 6 months and authorize all items on the service authorization.  The TFC provider in collaboration with the case manager shall set up a meeting to review the progress on the child’s individual treatment plan and discuss the discharge/transition plan no later than five months from the date of the child’s placement in the TFC home.   In order to prepare for child’s discharge/transition, a review shall be conducted by the RCST or other Department designee at the end of five months to ensure a successful transition.   If additional time is requested, the TFC provider and case manager shall seek authorization from the RCST or other Department designee to keep the child in the current TFC program.  The request shall specify the clinical and behavioral need(s) for extending the placement and shall identify specific treatment interventions and services that will be provided to meet the child’s treatment needs. Additionally, the RCST Coordinators will verify a child’s REHAB-RT eligibility prior to entering any service authorization for TFC. If the RCST Coordinator determines that an otherwise REHAB eligible youth has not had eligibility established in the FACES system, they will immediately contact the child’s case manager and/or supervisor. Service authorizations for TFC treatment services are not to be entered without verification that the FACES system indicates the child’s eligibility. Carry out any of the following actions as appropriate to the RCST Coordinator’s decision or recommendations: Advise court and develop alternative treatment and/or case plan if the referral is determined inappropriate or if other options for placement have been suggested. Coordinate all planning if county of current placement is different from county of jurisdiction. Case manger begins search for TFC home placement Notify the RCST Coordinator and TFC Coordinator in writing when TFC placement has been secured, providing name of TFC home, or if TFC home is no longer needed. Written notification should be made in all instances of placement or withdrawal of placement request. RCST will authorize the TFC placement service. Receive notification from provider of date for pre-placement interview visit. Proceed with placement preparation including the following: Prepare the child and parents for change in placement. Provide information about the facility, location, special programs, visitation arrangements, etc. Assess clothing needs and seek approval for expenditure if clothing is needed. Arrange dental and medical examination within 30 days prior to actual placement, if provider requires more recent medical report. Assure the child’s arrival at the facility on the date arranged for entry. Update the AC Client Information screen to denote a new placement. Complete a payment request if any special expenses are needed, have been approved, and are not included in the residential treatment contract. Update the AC Client Information screen to remove maintenance for any child entering a residential treatment agency. Provide any needed placement support services consistent with the CS-1 including services to the parents: Receive progress reports from the provider. The initial evaluation and plan of care should be in compliance with the FST plan, or if different, the reasons for any change must be documented. Determine what needs to occur to facilitate the child’s return to family or to another permanent placement in the community, coordinating and planning with the parent(s) and using recommendations of provider and the RCST Coordinator. Representatives of the treatment provider must be invited to attend the FST meeting. The treatment facility staffing can be combined with FST when appropriate as treatment goals, modality, and progress of child and family should be relevant discussion for members of both groups. Often the team members are the same for both meetings. Notify the RCST Coordinator in writing, immediately, of any child removed from an authorized placement. Include the date of discharge and identification of the present placement resource. Integrate the content of progress reports into services to the parents, FSTs, case plan development, reports to court, etc. The family may be included in therapeutic services provided to the child. Receive written notification from the RCST Coordinator at least 60 days prior to expiration date of treatment authorization. Receive notification from the provider at least 30 days prior to planned discharge of the child. If the FST has determined that the child and family are to be reunited, this plan shall be put into place. The TFC contractor, through therapeutic intervention with the youth and family, as well as working with the assigned case manager, shall identify necessary systems to support the family and youth during reunification. The case manager and other members of the FST will assure these supports are available to the family and youth as the goal of reunification is put into place. If the FST determines that return to the family or to another family setting is not appropriate, the case manager will: Submit recommendations to the RCST Coordinator regarding child’s continued need for treatment as soon as possible. The case-manager shall continue to determine what needs to occur to facilitate the child’s return to family or to another permanent placement in the community, coordinating and planning with the parent(s) and using recommendations of provider and the RCST Coordinator. The case manager shall continue to utilize this needs list to develop the treatment plan to be implemented by the case manager and the TFC contractor. If it appears the child will be unable to return to family of origin, the FST, with the involvement of the child and family shall develop alternate plans for the child using concurrent planning and meeting the Court and ASFA time lines. The child and his family shall be encouraged to locate relative placements or other permanent placements that will allow the child to remain involved with his/her family of origin, even if it is not realistic for the youth to be reunited with his/her family. Provide transitional services when the child returns to own family. If the child is unable to return to his/her family of origin, transitional services are provided as appropriate to meet the child’s needs and permanency plan.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/mo-section-4-chapter-2-placements-subsection-4-therapeutic-foster-care-placements-241

There are new types of clinical consultation reviews that will be necessary to complete in order for case managers to make the best informed consent decisions for children in alternative care and to ensure that their medical/mental health needs are being addressed appropriately. The Center for Excellence in CHILD Well-Being (The Center) is serving as the Statewide Clinical Consultant who completes Mandatory, Secondary, and Automatic Reviews. Staff may be familiar with Secondary and Automatic Reviews, discussed more fully below, but Mandatory Reviews are now required in certain specific instances BEFORE informed consent may be given for administration of a psychotropic medication. Mandatory Review BEFORE informed consent for psychotropic medications may be given, CD shall determine if a mandatory review by the Statewide Clinical Consultant (The Center) is required. A mandatory review is required in the following instances: Before a child age three (3) or younger is prescribed any psychotropic medication For a child age four (4) or older: Before starting a 3rd (or more) psychotropic medication; Before starting a 2nd (or more) antipsychotic; Before a psychotropic medication is started by a second prescriber; Before starting a psychotropic medication that exceeds dosage guidelines Referrals for Mandatory Reviews shall be made by the Health Information Specialist (HIS) to The Center as soon as practicable. The case manager needs to make contact with the HIS as soon as possible upon receiving a recommendation for psychotropic medication to notify the HIS to request a referral for a mandatory review. Consent cannot be given or medication administered until after the recommendations and findings of the mandatory review are received and considered by the case manager. Secondary Review A referral for a secondary review shall be submitted to The Center if any of the following occur: The case manager has concerns about psychotropic medications being prescribed, or any other recommended physical or behavioral health intervention. The parent or child disagrees with a case manager’s informed consent decision. Other members of the child’s FST, including the child’s GAL or CASA, the child’s resource provider, or the Juvenile Officer have submitted a request to CD to refer the case for secondary review of the child’s psychotropic medications or any other recommended physical or behavioral health intervention. Case managers shall ensure that all such requests are referred for secondary review, except that CD may, in its discretion, decline to perform more than one (1) review for a child within the same sixty (60) day period. The HIS will make the referral to The Center. The case manager needs to make contact with the HIS as soon as possible once a decision has been made that a secondary review is necessary based upon the criteria listed above, clearly documenting why the review is being requested. The online referral form shall be submitted within five (5) business days. Medical records to include in the referral: current diagnosis, prescriber notes, current medication list including dose and frequency, lab results, psychiatric evaluation, therapy reports and other records related to the child’s behavior or diagnosis. The Center shall, within five (5) business days of receiving the request for consultation, review the pending prescription and provide an opinion and recommendation as to the appropriateness and timing of the prescription (including but not limited to whether the child should begin taking the proposed medication immediately). Documentation of the request and the recommendation shall be included in the child’s case record. The individual authorized to provide informed consent shall consider the recommendation and collaborate with the prescriber if necessary prior to providing an informed consent decision. The findings and recommendations of The Center shall be provided to the child’s parent or legal guardian; the individual authorized to provide informed consent for the medication (if an alternative consenter has been appointed by the court), child’s resource provider, and any other person or entity authorized to receive the recommendation by order of the court. The findings and recommendations of The Center may be provided to other individuals as determined appropriate, who would include: GAL, CASA, other members of the FST, and medical providers. If a parent or child does not agree with the recommendation from The Center, the parent or child may: Within five (5) business days, initiate a service delivery grievance, or At any time, file an appropriate motion with the juvenile court If The Center has recommended immediate administration of a psychotropic medication, the case manager may follow that recommendation, regardless of any pending service delivery grievance or juvenile court motion filed by the parent. If The Center recommends that immediate administration of a psychotropic is NOT REQUIRED, the case manager will not consent to the medication until any service delivery grievance or juvenile court motion has been resolved. Automatic Reviews Staff will be notified when a child’s case has been identified for automatic review by The Center. These reviews will be completed on a quarterly basis for cases meeting identified criteria. The case manager shall have ten (10) business days from the date of receiving notice to collect the materials or documents that The Center requests to complete the review. The Center has five (5) business days to complete the review process. Denial Notification Letter of Center for Excellence Findings, CD-280 After a review is completed by The Center, the findings and recommendations are provided to the case manager. In the event that CD declines to share the findings and recommendations of The Center with the child’s parent or legal guardian, CD shall notify the individual in writing of the reason for denial using the Denial Notification Letter of Center for Excellence Findings, CD280. CD may only decline to share the findings and recommendation if at least one of the following criteria applies: The Court has entered an order limiting access to certain information about the child; Sharing information is not in the best interest of the child or could endanger the health, safety, and welfare of the child or another person; Sharing the information may interfere with a child abuse, child neglect, or a child investigation; or Providing information is contrary to law. The CD-280 will explain the individual’s right to seek a review by completing a service delivery grievance of that decision or to file an appropriate motion with a juvenile court.

INITIAL AND ONGOING SCREENINGS FOR CHILDREN IN ALTERNATIVE CARE,Missouri,Memo,"2024, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010","Administrative process, Contact and directory information, Entry to care, Services while in care - Medical","REGIONAL EXECUTIVE STAFF, CIRCUIT MANAGERS, AND CHILDREN’S DIVISION STAFF","PAULA NEESE, DIRECTOR","DISCUSSION: The purpose of this memorandum is to clarify the policy and practice requirements for obtaining the initial and ongoing medical examinations while a child is in alternative care. The initial health examination should occur within 24 hours of a child coming into care. This examination does not need to be a full Healthy Children and Youth (HCY) assessment. The purpose of the initial health examination is to identify the need for immediate medical or mental health care and assess for infectious and communicable diseases. When possible, this examination should be completed by the child’s current primary care physician as they know the child and have knowledge of the child’s medical history. In addition, there have been changes made to the policy regarding provider accessibility. If a provider is not readily accessible, the initial health examination must occur within 72 hours of the initial placement. Policy previously allowed ten days for the examination to occur when a provider was not readily accessible. The purpose of this change is to ensure that any immediate medical or mental health concerns are addressed in a timely manner. To meet Council on Accreditation Standards and statutory requirements, the following must be completed no later than 30 days after the child is placed in Children’s Division (CD) custody: The full HCY assessment including eye, hearing, and dental examinations; Alcohol and drug screenings; Developmental screening; and Mental health screening Priority efforts should be made to ensure that this assessment is completed by the physician who knows the child and his/her medical history. If this is not possible, the child’s medical records should be taken with the child for the HCY assessment. When possible and safe to do so, it may be advantageous for the parent(s) or previous caregiver(s) to be present during the assessment to give the physician historical medical information. Ongoing Screenings This memorandum also introduces Section 210.110, RSMo , which requires all children from birth to age 10 in CD custody to receive a physical, developmental, and mental health screening every six (6) months following the initial health examination, as long as the child remains in care. The HCY form, created by the MO HealthNet Division, includes screening questions for those areas. Prior to all Permanency Planning Review Team (PPRT) meetings, a full HCY assessment should be completed, thus staff should schedule appointments in a timely manner to ensure the appointment occurs prior to the PPRT meeting. Procedure It is the Children’s Service Worker’s responsibility to ensure that children in CD custody receive the appropriate screening, assessment, and follow-up services as necessary. During the screening, staff must either request the physician to complete a Healthy Children and Youth (HCY) examination, or give a copy of the appropriate HCY form to the physician to complete. Resource providers who accompany the child to the appointment should be given a copy of the appropriate HCY form by the worker to be completed by the physician. If there are no changes medically, or additional medical assistance is needed, staff should receive such documentation from the child’s physician and take appropriate action, if necessary. After the HCY exam is completed, the Children’s Service Worker should obtain the medical results and record(s) and share the information with the Family Support Team. If the resource provider accompanies the child to the health examination, the Children’s Service Worker should obtain the results of the examination from the resource provider or request the resource provider share the medical results with the Family Support Team. These screenings may occur as frequently as needed. All charges should be billed to MO HealthNet (Medicaid) or the appropriate managed care plan. The developmental and mental health screening portion of the HCY examination may also be completed by other professionals such as: Parents as Teachers, Nurses for Newborns, Early Head Start, Head Start, First Steps, child care centers, the child’s therapist, or the school the child attends. Documentation Copies of the screenings and assessments should be maintained in the child section of the case record. Medical documentation including the screenings and assessments should be obtained prior to the PPRT meeting so that the information can be available for the meeting. Staff should also discuss any changes in the child’s medical status at the PPRT meeting. All medical needs identified should be discussed with the Permanency Planning Review Team. The date of the initial physical examination and the date of the last physical examination should be entered on the Medical Information screen in FACES. The Children’s Service Worker must ensure that all initial medical information is given to the resource provider within 72 hours of the child coming into care if possible, but no later than 30 days following placement. A list of the medical information to be obtained can be found in Section 4 Chapter 24.2 of the Child Welfare Manual. The changes outlined in this memorandum will be effective as of today’s date.

PERMITTING A FOSTER CHILD TO REMAIN IN THE SAME SCHOOL THEY ATTENDED AT THE TIME OF PLACEMENT,Missouri,Memo,"2007, 2006",Services while in care - Educational,"REGIONAL EXECUTIVE STAFF, CIRCUIT MANAGERS AND CHILDREN’S DIVISION STAFF","PAULA NEESE, INTERIM DIRECTOR","House Bill 1453 required the Children’s Division to consult with the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) to establish necessary procedures to implement the following statute: “Upon request of foster family, the guardian ad litem, or the volunteer advocate and whenever possible, the child shall be permitted to continue to attend the same school that the child was enrolled in and attending at the time the child was taken into custody by the division.” (211.032.7(2), RSMo) When possible, with the best interest of the child in mind, arranging for the child to continue to attend the same school should be discussed during the 24/72 hour Family Support Team meeting. Distance from original school may be a factor in recommending such arrangements, however, based on location of the foster family, the school district may be able to provide transportation. DESE has provided some options for the team to consider, including: The school bus of the foster child’s home district travels to the home of the foster parent to pick up the child. These miles would be considered eligible miles for the school district to include in their allowable cost for state aid; The foster parent provides transportation and receives reimbursement for mileage from the school district. School districts can include this as an allowable cost for state aid; The foster parent meets the school bus at the boundary line of the school district. The school district contracts with an individual, besides the foster parent, to transport the child to their home school district. This would be an allowable cost for state aid for school districts; or The foster parent provides transportation with no reimbursement for mileage from the school district. Please note that the law does not require schools to provide reimbursement as described above. When it is determined to be in the child’s best interest, the Foster Parent/Children’s Division staff should enroll the child in their new school. It is the responsibility of the new school to request transfer of records from the old school, pursuant to Sections 167.022 and 211.032.7(1) RSMo., within two business days, upon notification by the Division. Central Office will be distributing a letter to all foster parents explaining this legislative and policy change. NECESSARY ACTIONS: Please review this memorandum with all Children’s Division Staff.

QUALITY WORKER VISITS WITH CHILDREN,Missouri,Memo,"2024, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010","Administrative process, Contact and directory information, Definitions, Forms - Other, Group and residential care, Visitation","REGIONAL EXECUTIVE STAFF, CIRCUIT MANAGERS, AND CHILDREN’S DIVISION STAFF","PAULA NEESE, DIRECTOR","DISCUSSION: The purpose of this memorandum is to introduce changes to policy regarding worker visits with children in alternative care. The changes come as a result of requests through the Continuous Quality Improvement process and a workgroup composed of contracted workers and staff from each of the regions with a goal to improve the quality of worker visits with children. The workgroup reviewed research from other states on best practices and made recommendations for policy. While some of the recommendations from the work group could not be accommodated, many of the changes being made to focus on quality were based on recommendations from the workgroup. Worker Visits with Children in Alternative Care For purposes of compliance review, the Children’s Division will be adopting the federal and Council on Accreditation standard for monthly visitation, which is one visit per calendar month, as the minimum number of visits required. Staff will likely visit with children more than once a month; however, the worker visit report will calculate compliance per calendar month based on the federal standard. Regardless of the number of visits and contacts a worker has with the child or youth within any given calendar month, at least one visit must occur within the placement setting. For quality reviews, the goal for visiting with children and youth each month should be to have more contact and interaction than the minimum allowable. Planning a schedule for visitation should always take into consideration the specific needs and current situation of each child or youth, which could mean more visits with some children and youth than others. It may also mean more face-to-face contact with a child or youth one month compared to another. Visitation with children and youth, biological parents and resource providers should be topics of discussion when workers and supervisors review case progress or challenges during individual conferences to ensure that worker visitation meets the individual needs of each child and family. A Core Outcome of Visits- Relationship Visiting with children and youth that are in the care and custody of the Children’s Division is important for many reasons. The primary purpose of the visit is to assess child safety and well-being. Staff should observe how the child is interacting and functioning in their placement environment. Staff should also discuss how the children are doing in all environments including school, visits with parents and/or siblings, social settings, etc. A core positive outcome of spending time together through visits, whether it be worker/child, child/parent, worker/parent resource provider or sibling visits, is having the opportunity to gain understanding, trust, cooperation, and problem-solve, as individuals continue to build a relationship with one another. A relationship that establishes mutual respect and dignity, two-way communication and understanding is the foundation for best practice as staff seek to work with children, families and all others. Spending quality time with others, including children, increases the child’s sense that they are valued and what they have to say is important. Engagement with the child was identified by the workgroup as an area needing improvement. In the reference documents and resources section of this memorandum, there are sample questions and developmental milestones which may be beneficial for staff when visiting with children and resource providers. Supervisors should assist workers in identifying activities which can be done during a visit to engage and strengthen the relationship between the worker and the child. In addition, the OJT guide contains worker competencies relevant for worker visits with children and should be utilized by staff and supervisors to support professional development of staff. Defining Quality Understanding what quality means can help improve the quality of worker visits with children. A few important elements to ensure quality visits are occurring include: The visit is meaningful for the child The child is able to discuss their concerns with the worker Spending time with the child Being supportive Relationship building Observing the child’s interactions, sleeping arrangements, bedroom The visit is scheduled based on the needs of the children and families The visit is planned and the worker knows which areas need to be discussed Discussing changes in the child or family’s circumstances Engaging and connecting with the child Covering the discussion points on the Checklist for Worker/Child Visits, CD-82 Older Youth Foster care for older youth, when compared to younger children, is a very different experience. For adolescents, emphasis needs to be placed on relationships. The past experiences of older youth are often filled with unmet needs and rejection. How a youth feels about their past and current situation can influence their decisions. Thus, staff should visit and communicate regularly with older youth to help them in their time of need. It is just as important to visit older youth as it is to visit young children, especially as older youth learn important life skills and prepare for adulthood. At this time in their lives, adolescents are trying to determine their own identities, their own values, and make their own decisions. Results from the State Worker Report shows that older youth are visited much less than younger children. Many older youth may lack the consistency that younger children have and as a result, consistent worker visits are important. Members of the State Youth Advisory Board report that they want and need to see their workers each month whether they live independently, or are placed in a residential facility. One challenge facing older youth is making a permanent connection with at least one positive adult. Workers can be a positive connection for youth, but can also help the youth consider and identify adults in their lives that are important for them to maintain or strengthen contact with. Youth who have a positive connection with a caring adult are more likely to be successful in their transition into adulthood than youth without a positive connection. Visits with Youth in Residential Facilities The policy regarding worker visits with children in residential facilities has also been modified. When a youth is placed in a residential facility out of county, policy previously allowed for staff to contact the youth the following day by phone, but the youth only had to be seen within 14 days from the placement. This memorandum changes the policy and requires a face to face visit with the youth within five (5) business days after placement. Revised Checklist for Worker/Child Visits, CD-82, Worker/Child/Caregiver Guide This memorandum also introduces the revised Checklist for Worker/Child Visits, CD-82, now titled the Worker/Child/Caregiver Guide. The new form is intended to be used as a guide for staff to improve the quality of the visit. The CD-82 has been modified to ensure that workers discuss all the relevant topics with the child and resource provider at least once a month. Workers should document the visit in FACES including thorough, complete documentation of all the discussion points from the CD-82 form. In addition, this form can be made optional based on the supervisor’s discretion. Workers who complete this form properly over a period of time and thoroughly document the information in FACES can be given permission to discontinue use of the form. New workers should utilize the form until the supervisor feels they no longer need the form to conduct a quality visit. After the contents of the form are entered into FACES, the worker may destroy the form as it does not need to be kept in the case file. Elimination of the Placement Provider Home Visit Checklist, CD-84 and Second Face-to-Face Resource Provider Visit In addition, the changes in this memorandum also include eliminating the Placement Provider Home Visit Checklist, CD-84. Workers should document any discussion with the resource provider(s) along with the other CD-82 discussion points in the case contacts in FACES.  This memorandum also changes the requirement for visiting resource providers face-to-face. Previous policy required resource providers to be seen face-to-face twice a month. The new change requires staff to visit resource providers face-to-face in the placement once a month and requires at least one phone call to the resource provider each month. Again, contact with resource providers beyond this is encouraged. Contact specific to the individual needs of the provider is our goal. Teamwork and clear communication between the case manager and resource provider is critical. Though email communication can be helpful for short exchanges of information, it cannot substitute for true dialogue and consensus building discussion. Staff should notify the resource providers of the change in policy. The Child Welfare Manual has been modified to reflect the new policy. For additional information regarding worker visits with children, see Memo CD08-18 . The provisions outlined in this memorandum will be effective as of February 1, 2010. The state worker visit report in FACES will be updated to reflect this change in policy. The March 2010 report will capture worker visits with children for February 2010.

LACK OF CONSENSUS AT FAMILY SUPPORT/PERMANENCY PLANNING REVIEW TEAM MEETINGS,Missouri,Memo,2007,"Administrative process, Contact and directory information","REGIONAL EXECUTIVE STAFF, CIRCUIT MANAGERS, AND CHILDREN’S DIVISION STAFF","PAULA NEESE, DIRECTOR","DISCUSSION: This memorandum addresses steps staff should follow when there is a lack of consensus at Family Support Team (FST) or Permanency Planning Review Team (PPRT) meetings. Occasionally, there are situations when FST/PPRT participants put forth recommendations which Children’s Division (CD) staff cannot accept as the recommendations are not believed to be in the best interest of the child and/or conflicts with Child Welfare policy. Unless otherwise indicated in the Child Welfare Manual (CWM), staff should follow the steps listed below when confronted with a lack of consensus at a FST/PPRT meeting. The Children’s Service Worker (CSW) should: Inform the participants of the meeting that s(he) may not agree with the recommendation and will need to seek supervisory guidance. Refer the issue to the next level of supervision for review and guidance. The Supervisor/Circuit Manager or designee should review the recommendation. If it is determined the recommendation is in the best interest of the child, the Supervisor/Circuit Manager or designee should provide written documentation to the CSW as to why the recommendation is appropriate, and the CSW should then submit the case plan to the court of jurisdiction. If it is determined the recommendation is not in the best interest of the child, the Supervisor/Circuit Manager or designee should provide the CSW with written documentation as to why the recommendation is not appropriate. The CSW should then submit the case plan along with a written explanation to the court of jurisdiction why the CD believes the specific recommendation is not in the best interest of the child. The recommendations listed below are two examples which the Children’s Division may not agree with the FST/PPRT participants: The FST/PPRT recommends a child be placed in an out-of-state residential treatment facility, or The FST/PPRT recommends the separation of a sibling group for placement or adoption. If these, or any other recommendations, appear to not be in the best interest of the child, and/or conflicts with CD’s Child Welfare policy, staff should follow the steps listed above before agreeing to implement the recommendation.

REVISION OF CHILD WELFARE MANUAL POLICY RELATED TO INVESTIGATION/FAMILY ASSESSMENT; FAMILY-CENTERED SERVICES; AND FAMILY-CENTERED OUT-OF-HOME CARE INTRODUCTION OF CD-14 FCS FAMILY ASSESSMENT PACKET AND INSTRUCTIONS; CD-14E RISK ASSESSMENT AND FST-1 FAMILY SUPPORT TEAM MEETING CONFIDENTIALITY STATEMENT/SIGN-IN SHEET,Missouri,Memo,2005,"Administrative process, Contact and directory information, Forms - Other, Foster parent licensing, Investigations","REGIONAL EXECUTIVE STAFF, CIRCUIT MANAGERS AND CHILDREN’S DIVISION STAFF","PAULA NEESE, INTERIM DIRECTOR","DISCUSSION: The purpose of this memorandum is to introduce the new (CD-14) FCS Family Assessment Packet and revisions to related policy and procedure for investigation/family assessment response; Family-Centered Services family assessment and service planning and Family-Centered Out-of-Home Care policy. Minimum Contact Standards for In-Home Cases Minimum contact standards for in-home cases were established with the introduction of Structured Decision Making (SDM) in December of 2003, (Children’s Division Memorandum CS03-51) in order to assure that families with the highest risk levels were seen with the most frequency. Effective immediately, minimum contact standards will go into effect at the time the investigation/family assessment is concluded on the CPS-1 or the date the delayed conclusion is entered into the system. This standard should begin within the mandated 30 day timeframe given to conclude child abuse and neglect reports. The SDM risk level is assessed initially during the investigation/family assessment process on the CPS-1 and then re-assessed every 90 days on the CS-16E. The “Children’s Division Minimum Contact Standards” (Section 2, Chapter 9.5.2 - Minimum Contact Standards for In-Home Cases) represent how many of the overall contact standards must be met by the CD worker according the SDM level of risk. The remaining contacts may be met by a contracted in-home service provider who is working with the family as part of the family’s case plan. However, if the contracted service provider was unable to complete monthly contacts, the CD worker is responsible for meeting the overall contact standards. It is the responsibility of the Circuit Manager to formulate local protocol to assure that CD staff is meeting minimum contact standards. This may be met in accordance with the particular circuit’s personnel and resources, but the protocol should determine the member of staff ultimately responsible for contacts with the family. In some circuits this may be met by an FCS worker, prior to the opening of the case and in some circuits the CA/N worker may continue to make the required contacts until the case is assigned. Prior to FCS case assignment, at minimum , the following should be addressed: Is there an active Safety Plan and does it adequately address the safety issues? Do Safety interventions need to be revised? (Staff may use a CS-16D) Have circumstances changed in the family composition that would warrant a safety assessment or re-assessment? (Example: new members of household, such as a new adult, new baby or additional children or relatives) Have circumstances changed in regard to the family physical location/environment that would warrant a safety assessment or re-assessment? (Example: eviction, new housing, utilities shut off, household composition changes causing crowding) Have circumstances changed in regard to family physical health? (Example: caretaker or a child has become ill, new medical expenses or not following through with medical services) Have circumstances changed in regard to family mental health or substance abuse issues? (Example: Not complying with prescription medication, psychotic break or suicide attempt, escalated symptoms) Have there been incidents or reported concerns regarding child abuse/neglect, domestic violence or criminal activity? CD-14 FCS Family Assessment Packet The CD-14 FCS Family Assessment Packet tools replace the (CS-16) Family Assessment Packet and will be used for the initial assessment and reassessment in open Family-Centered Services (FCS), Family-Centered Out-Of-Home Care (FCOOHC) and preventive service cases. These tools are designed to assist staff in conducting more thorough and comprehensive assessments of family’s history, structure and functioning; identifying family strengths, supports and service needs; and translating those strengths, supports and service needs into meaningful service plans that reduce risk of future child maltreatment and maintain positive change in family functioning. The CD-14 FCS Family Assessment Packet is comprised of the (CD-14) FCS Family Assessment, (CD-14A) Family Functioning Assessment/Re-assessment, (CD-14B) Written Service Agreement, (CD-14C) Formal/Informal Provider Contact Sheet and the (CD-14D) Termination of Services/Aftercare Plan. As of the effective date of this memorandum the CD-14 packet tools linked to this document should be downloaded and all previous versions should be deleted from all computers. The CD-14B and CD-14D are now available and may be ordered from the warehouse. (CD-14) FCS Family Assessment Experienced staff will recognize the similarities of the new (CD-14) FCS Family Assessment with the former (CS-16) Family Assessment . It includes the genogram and the ecomap which have been enhanced by adding questions that focus the worker on questions pertinent to the family’s history, structure and functioning. The pattern of behavior, now optional, includes an example to illustrate how dysfunctional patterns of behavior lead to negative consequences and how interventions can be applied at various entry points to interrupt the cycle of unhealthy patterns. Systemic family- centered tools encourage family engagement and yield rich, essential information about the family’s past and present functioning; and their beliefs and concerns about the future. Staff will have 30 days from the date the case is assigned to the FCS worker to complete the assessment, but initial contact by the assigned worker shall be in accordance with initial contact case priority. Initial contact priority is the timeframe determined by the SDM level of risk score found on the CPS-1 risk assessment. SDM Level of Risk Timeframe from CPS-1 Conclusion Date Low Within 10 working days Moderate Within 5 working days High or Very High Within 1 working day (CD-14A) Family Functioning Assessment/Re-assessment The (CD-14A) Family Functioning Assessment/Reassessment is the most significant enhancement to the family assessment and service planning package. The CD-14A is a comprehensive family functioning assessment tool which assists the worker in processing information gathered from the systemic tools, worker observation, provider and collateral contact, family history and engagement with the family. The CD14A addresses family functioning under nine domains (Basic Needs, Caregiver Ability, Educational/Vocational, Physical Health, Mental Health, Substance Use, Family Interaction, Criminal/Legal and Child Well-Being). Under each domain several related sub-factors are listed to prompt the worker to rate each according to the positive or negative impact on the family’s overall functioning. Rating possibilities include: clear strength, moderate strength, adequate, moderate need and serious need . Clear and moderate strengths; and moderate and serious needs are documented and described in the appropriate space provided below the sub-factors. Strengths and needs are evaluated, prioritized and addressed in the (CD-14B) Written Service Agreement . The CD-14A should be conducted primarily with the family, though information helpful in rating sub-factors may be collected for a variety of sources during the 30 day timeframe in which the CD-14A must be completed. CD-14A for Re-assessment After using the CD-14A for initial assessment for case openings the CD-14A is repeated every 90 days until the case is closed as a family functioning re-assessment tool. The CS-16E Risk Reassessment is also conducted at this time. Re-assessment of the family every 90 days allows the worker to measure progress or identify changes in sub- factors that may impact family functioning in a positive or negative way. Changes in family functioning that raise safety concerns may prompt a worker to conduct a CS-16D Safety Re-assessment. Re-assessment should be complete within 30 days of the date the family is due for re-assessment. E xisting Safety Plan (CPS-1A) procedures remain in effect and should be utilized if safety factors are present. (CD-14B) Written Service Agreement The ( CD-14B) Written Service Agreement takes the place of the (CS-16B) Family Plan for Change. The CD-14B is used to document the service plan for FCS cases on intact families as well as for the preliminary treatment plan developed at the 72-hour FST meeting after a child has been placed in out-of-home care that will cover the first 30 days the child is in care. At the 30 day FST meeting the CS-1 Case Plan/Written Service Agreement will take its place. Goal and task development questions, found on the CS-16B were included on the CD- 14B to assist workers in processing and setting measurable, time limited goals connected directly to service needs identified on the CD-14A or by a Family Support Team. The tasks development questions should direct the worker to formulate concrete, obtainable tasks designed to move the family toward stated goals. Goals and tasks should be developed jointly by the worker and the family. The CD-14B is a one page, stand alone tool signed by the family. A copy is given to the family and the original is attached to the CD-14A at the end of each 90 day assessment period. (CD-14C) Formal/Informal Provider Contact Sheet The (CD-14C) Formal/Informal Provider Contact Sheet serves as an ongoing listing of services, formal (counseling, daycare facility, mentoring program…etc.) or informal (relatives, neighbors or friends…etc.). This list is attached to the front of the case file and meant to extend through the life of the families case. Additional sheets may be attached as needed. (CD-14D) Termination of Service/Aftercare Plan The (CD-14D) Termination of Services/Aftercare Plan is a one page, stand alone tool completed with the family when at the time the case is closed. It is printed on 3 part NCR paper so that the family can have a copy after completion. The original is attached to the last CD-14A. Supply is available through the warehouse. At the time of case closure the worker will: Discuss with the family and document positive behavioral changes in family functioning and the reduction of risk; Discuss challenges to maintaining positive growth; family strengths to build on; and supports/services needed for continued progress; Develop an aftercare plan with the family including services/support remaining in place that will maintain positive changes; Addresses the sustainability of positive change and linkage with formal or informal supports/services the family can access to maintain acceptable risk; Include appropriate numbers or contacts the family can access in time of crisis that may impact the children’s risk or immediate safety. CD-14 Family Assessment Packet with the (CS-1) Child Assessment and Service Plan The complete (CD-14) Family Assessment Packet is used in conjunction with the (CS-1) Child Assessment and Service Plan for families who have child(ren) in out-of- home care. The CS-1 is designed to gather information about a child’s specific safety, permanency, and well-being. The CD-14 and CD-14A are essential pieces to assessing strengths and service needs of the family as a whole. For FCOOHC cases, the worker should begin the process of family assessment using the CD-14 Family Assessment Packet at the initial contact with the family. Workers should have the CD-14 and CD14A, available for reference or documentation at every Family Support Team Meeting. CD-14E SDM Risk Assessment The CD-14E is the SDM Risk Assessment currently found in the CPS-1. It is now available as a stand alone form for those less frequent occasions when an FCS case is opened that was not initiated by a CA/N Report. (Example: court gives CD custody of a child without allegations of abuse or neglect). In most open cases a CS-16E Risk Re- assessment will be used to determine the level of risk. Family Support Team Meetings for Intact Families Although family support team meetings are an integral part of the family out-of-home process, there are many intact families with multiple needs who could benefit greatly from family support team meeting. FST meetings for intact families are not a new concept and being used regularly as an option in various parts of the state. Workers are discovering that by bringing together the necessary formal and informal participants, a family support team process can assist the worker in moving the family closer to achieving and maintaining positive change and reducing the risk for future maltreatment or the need for out-of-home care. (FST-1) Family Support Team Meeting Confidentiality Statement/Sign-in Sheet Related to the family support team meetings for intact families is the introduction of the FST-1. The FST-1 is a confidentiality statement and sign in sheet for participants in a family support team meeting held for an intact family. For FCOOHC cases the confidentiality statement and sign in sheet is included in the CS-1. NECESSARY ACTIONS: Please review this memorandum with all Children’s Division Staff.

This memo will review best practice for this program, and the use of the Department of Mental Health (DMH) therapeutic foster homes as they continue to be valuable in providing expertise and support for children in therapeutic foster homes. Availability payments should not occur over the 60-day transition period when the Career Foster Parent(s) are unwilling to accept children who fit the profile and are considered by the team as appropriate for placement. Career Foster Parents will now be allowed to submit a plan to Area Office for approval to work outside the home in addition to being a CFC parent. This will be considered on a case by case basis. Career Foster Parents, staff and other treatment team members must continue to aggressively pursue permanency and use periodic reviews as one of the tools to assure progress toward permanency is occurring. We will no longer use IQ as a singular characteristic to rule children out of therapeutic foster care. Children with developmental delays may, or may not, be appropriate for BFC or CFC. However, an IQ score of 65 or below should not, as a singular characteristic, rule the child out for this level of care. Instead, appropriateness for therapeutic foster care should be based on the Selection/Screening Team and/or FST evaluation of all the child’s clinical and behavioral characteristic, including the child’s strengths and permanency goals, as well as functioning level, severity of developmental delays, type of behavioral problems, level of physical aggression, size, age, and need for supervision. NECESSARY ACTION: Review this memorandum with all Children’s Services staff. As this will be a change in practice for many providers, we ask that all Areas and County offices notify their alternative care providers of these changes. The following mentioned manual chapters for this memorandum will be made and put on the Child Welfare Manual Intranet site: Section 4 Chapter 4 “Selection of Placement Resource and Placement Options”, Section 4 Chapter 16 “Career Foster Homes/Individualized Care”, Section 4 Chapter 16 Attachment B “Career Parent Responsibilities and Employment”.

MEDICAL FOSTER CARE POLICY REVISION,Missouri,Memo,"2024, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010",Services while in care - Medical,"REGIONAL EXECUTIVE STAFF, CIRCUIT MANAGERS, AND CHILDREN’S DIVISION STAFF","PAULA NEESE, DIRECTOR","DISCUSSION: The purpose of this memo is to introduce the revision of Children’s Division policy and forms for eligibility and placement of foster youth in a resource home for elevated medical needs. The revision of the medical foster care policy was completed with participation and contribution from pediatricians. A youth in foster care who: is medically diagnosed with extraordinary medical condition(s) and or mental or physical disabilities, and requires twenty-four (24) hour availability of a resource provider specifically trained to meet the elevated medical needs, and has a diagnosed condition significantly and substantially impairs the youth’s ability to function on a daily basis, is eligible for placement in a resource provider home contracted to provide Medical Foster Care services. The Medical Foster Care Assessment Tool, CS-10, has been revised to provide clarification of what diagnoses deem a foster youth with elevated medical conditions eligible for a medical resource home. Two sections on the form provide for a comprehensive assessment of eligible need: Section II: Any one condition identified in Section II qualifies the foster youth for placement in a medical resource home. If the eligibility was determined by a selection in subsection A of Section II, there is no requirement of reassessment, unless the medical condition has changed. Youth determined to be eligible under subsection B through E will require annual reassessment. Documentation regarding the eligible condition is required. Submission of the Physician’s Certification Letter, CD-144, is not required for this section. Section III: This section is completed by the treating physician as the certification that a medical resource home placement is required. A new form, the Physician’s Certification Letter, CD-144, is the cover letter to attach to the CS-10. The CD-144 and CS-10 are provided to the treating physician only if the foster youth does not meet any eligible criteria in Section II, yet the Family Support Team recommends that a medical resource home placement is the best interest for the foster youth. The status of each condition identified in this section is to be reviewed annually to determine continued eligibility for a medical resource home. Implementation of revised policy and utilization of the updated forms begins immediately upon publication of this memo. Any foster youth currently identified at the medical level of foster care prior to publication date of this memo will remain eligible for medical foster care and do not require annual reassessment unless a re-evaluation is requested by the Family Support Team.

Respite care may be planned in advance or used due to an immediate family need. Respite care is made available to resource providers based on the needs of the family. These needs may include, but are not limited to, illness, death in the family, hospitalization, or imminent risk of removal of the child where ""time out"" would stabilize the placement. Respite care should not be used for regular child care purposes. Respite care for children in specialized foster care, such as youth with elevated needs foster homes, will be provided per the respective program guidelines. As the result of a CQI request and following discussion with the Executive team, respite policy has been updated to allow staff the ability, on a case by case basis, to obtain supervisor approval for up to 20 units of respite for a resource provider per child. Approval to exceed 20 units requires the approval of the regional director or their designee. When families require approval for over 20 units of respite, consultation with the case manager, licensing worker and supervisor should occur to assure any additional supports, services, training, etc., are offered to the family to stabilize placements in the resource family.

The revisions and new materials are a result of recommendations submitted by three Recruitment and Retention Task Force work groups. Respite care is the provision of periodic and/or intermittent, temporary substitute care of children who are in the care and custody of the Children’s Division (CD), placed in a licensed resource home (foster, relative or kinship, emergency). The respite plan should serve equally the needs of both the foster youth and the foster caregivers. Using respite is important to reduce placement disruptions and to support safer and healthier homes. Missouri Respite Provider Care Training is required before approving a respite vendor to provide services. The training is available on the Internet. The training may be completed self-taught or in an instructor led classroom setting. All new resource provider applicants must complete the Missouri Respite Provider Care Training prior to being referred to a STARS pre-service training class. The training will be credited as an inservice training once the vendor is opened and approved to provide services. Relative and Kinship applicants are not required to complete the respite training prior to licensure. All currently licensed or approved resource parents may complete the respite training for in-service training credit. The new respite pamphlet may be printed from Children’s Division E-forms. Ample space on the back is provided to enter contact information. The QR bar code located on the back directs the user to Children’s Division Respite policy.

Revisions include the requirement of a career respite provider to participate in career respite training and the career respite training expectations. Career Respite Care Provider Approval Process Respite care providers must be approved by the Children’s Division. Approval Process of Respite Care Providers outlines the process to follow including background checks, and the completion of the CS-RC-1 and CS-RC-3. There is an additional step for the provider who will provide the respite service outside the home of the child’s resource parent; completing the Foster Respite Care Provider Checklist, CS-RC-2. Completion of the CS-RC-2 is required as set forth in CSR 40-60.040 Physical Standards for Foster Homes. Career respite care providers must complete career respite training. Career Respite Care Training The career respite training is developed locally. The 8 hours of training curriculum includes: An overview of skills needed for parenting abuse/neglected children including issues related to physical/emotional development of children in foster care including: Communication Skills Building self-esteem Caring for children with inappropriate or destructive behavior such as lying, physical aggression, property destruction, and sexual acting out. Agency rules, regulations, policy and forms Behavioral management techniques including appropriate discipline techniques Techniques for caring for a child with serious behavior/emotional problems. This training should include crisis intervention, suicide management, and local protocol for handling emergency situations In addition to the 8 hours of Career Respite training, child specific training for each new child placed in the home will be done by the career resource provider prior to the child receiving the respite services. Career respite care providers must complete CPR and First Aid Training in accordance with policy outlined for licensed resource providers. Career respite care providers will be encouraged to participate in on-going training opportunities on caring for children with elevated physical/emotional development issues Guidelines for Use Respite care is designed to provide temporary relief from stressful or emergency situations. It is not to be used for regular child care purposes. The career resource parent will provide a completed Child Information Form, CD-110, to the career respite care provider. The utilization of this form will aid the career resource parent in providing the required child specific training for each new child placed in the home prior to receiving respite services A career respite provider will provide care for a maximum of 2 career level children simultaneously. A career licensed provider may not be contracted as a career respite provider unless a waiver has been granted by the Regional Director or designee. A career licensed provider who has a signed career respite contract may provide respite care for up to 2 additional career level children on a case–by-case basis provided that the following is in place: The total capacity does not exceed 4 placements Regional Director or Designee approval The respite care is for a period of 48 hours or less A back-up plan is in place in the event of a placement disruption during the respite period Consideration is given to: the behaviors, health, and elevated needs of each individual foster youth; the age and sex of each foster youth; how each individual child interacts with the other youth in the home All of the criteria and information listed above must be clearly documented in the career provider's licensing record. Career resource providers are encouraged to use respite care a minimum of one weekend per month plus 14 days per year (12 month period). ) The one weekend per month of respite care does not carry over to the next month. The 14 days per year reset upon the anniversary of the placement of the foster youth in the home. A unit of respite care is defined as a minimum of 12 hours up to a maximum of 24 hours. Use of career respite care is not to exceed 14 units per child during a 12 month period of time and the additional one weekend a month (2 units). The 12 month period will begin calculating on the date that the child was placed in the resource provider’s home. Upon the one year anniversary date of the child’s placement in that home, the units will reset. Unused units from the previous 12 month period are not rolled over to the new 12 month period. At any time a child is placed in a new provider's home, the respite units reset for that child at the new placement. Local staff will be responsible for tracking the number of units. Tracking will be done with the newly developed Respite Unit Tracking Log, CD- 113. Reimbursement for Respite Care Career respite care providers must have a current contract to provide career respite, CM-9/RP, in order to receive payment from the Children’s Division. Career respite care providers are reimbursed $40.00 per unit per child for those children that are classified on the Alternative Care Client Information as a career level child. The respite payment is processed by the Children’s Service Worker (CSW) via a CS-65. The resource parent will submit the completed Respite Provider Evaluation/Payment Invoice, CD-111, to the CSW within 5 working days of receiving the respite service. The CD-111 provides a uniform process to submit respite units and to monitor the appropriateness of the respite care provider as a respite resource. The worker will make only one payment entry for the respite services per month for the respite care provider in order to avoid duplication errors in data entry. The payment entry (CS-65) needs to be entered by the last day of the month to ensure timely payment to the provider. A copy of the CD-111 will be retained in the respite care provider’s case file. Case Recording A case file will be maintained for the career respite care provider. The outline for the case recording of a respite only resource is provided in Respite Care Case Recording.

SIMMENS, DIRECTOR","DISCUSSION: The purpose of this memorandum is to revise existing Career respite care policy as it relates to the time Career Foster Parents may use respite for the foster children in their home. According to current Children’s Division policy, Career Foster Parents are encouraged to use respite care for all the children placed in their home, at the same time and frequency regardless of level of care as outlined in Section 4.11.Attachment A. In order to better serve children, foster families, and respite providers, respite care will continue to be provided for all foster children in the CFP home at the same frequency, regardless of the foster child’s level of care. However, respite care no longer has to be provided for all children in the CFP home at the same time. Career parents are now given the option to determine the actual time(s) to use respite, based on the individual needs of the child(ren) in their home. Allowing the family to decide which children will be provided respite on a particular day/weekend will be helpful, in that it will allow additional flexibility to meet the needs of the child. This change was based on feedback from the Northeast Region Foster Parent Advisory Board. NECESSARY ACTION: Review this memorandum with all Children’s Division staff.

This memorandum provides information regarding revisions to respite care policy found in Section 4 Chapter 17 of the Child Welfare Manual. The revised policy includes the introduction of five new forms; Child Information Form for Respite Provider, CD-110, Respite Provider Evaluation/Payment Invoice, CD-111, Resource Family Exit Interview, CD-112, Respite Unit Tracking Log, CD-113, and Resource Parent Discipline Agreement, CD-119. Types of Respite Care The Children’s Division contracts with respite care providers to provide respite service to a licensed resource home (foster, relative or kinship) in the home of the resource parent, or in the home of the respite care provider. If the service is provided in the home of the respite provider, the resource worker will use the Foster Respite Care Provider Checklist, CS-RC-2, to determine that the home is approved for child placement as set forth in CSR 40-60.040 Physical Standards for Foster Homes. Respite services may be approved as part of an adoption or guardianship agreement. Recruitment and Retention The Resource Family Exit Interview, CD-112, is intended to facilitate the recruitment of those resource parents who no longer wish to provide continuous care and wish to close their foster care license. This form should be given to and discussed with the resource parents at the final home visit. It can also be used to recruit former resource providers that left the agency in good standing. The resource worker will provide support and instruction to the respite care provider to encourage and promote retention of this vital resource. Retention activities are outlined in Section 4 Chapter 17 Subsection 3. Approval Process Respite care providers must be approved by the Children’s Division. Section 4 Chapter 17 subsection 4 outlines the process to follow including background checks, and the completion of the CS-RC-1 and CS-RC-3. Staff are also required to complete the Foster Respite Care Provider Checklist, CS-RC-2 if respite services are to be provided outside the resource parent’s home. Respite care providers are required to be fingerprinted every two years. The Children’s Division shall pay for the cost of the fingerprinting. The process for conducting fingerprints is located in Section 6 Chapter 3 Attachment A. Staff may not approve the application or renewal of any person in which a record check reveals that a felony conviction for child abuse or neglect, spousal abuse, a crime against children (including child pornography), or a crime involving violence, including rape, sexual assault, or homicide, but not including other physical assault or battery was determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. Staff may also not approve the application or renewal of any person who in the past five years has had a court of competent jurisdiction determine a felony conviction for physical assault, battery, or a drug-related offense. Workers must follow the guidelines for approval outlined in policy and not impose additional requirements on the provider. Two additional forms that Respite providers are required to sign are the Resource Parent Discipline Agreement, CD-119, and the Safe Sleep Practices, CD-117. If a licensed resource home also has a respite contract and is utilized for respite services, it is important to ensure that licensing capacities and other licensing regulations are met. The providers must demonstrate that they are able to supervise all the children in their care. Renewal Process Respite care providers must have their contract renewed on a yearly basis. Prior to allowing the contract, Cooperative Agreement for the Purchase of Foster Respite Care Services, CM-10, to be signed, the renewal process for determining approval of the provider for utilization of respite services must be completed. A summary of the previous year’s activity in the home, background checks, and a new CS-RC-2 must be completed. The fingerprinting process is only completed every two years. This process is outlined in Section 4 Chapter 17 Subsection 5. Guidelines for Use Respite care is designed to provide temporary relief from stressful or emergency situations. It is not to be used for regular child care purposes. The resource parent will provide a completed Child Information Form, CD-110, to the respite care provider. The utilization of this new form is to better equip the respite care provider with information about the children they will be taking care of and whom they can contact in case of an emergency. If the placement child is identified to be at behavioral level, another trained Behavior Foster Care resource parent must be used for the respite services. A unit of respite care for licensed traditional, medical, behavioral, relative and kinship providers is defined as a minimum of 12 hours up to a maximum of 24 hours. Use of respite care is not to exceed 12 units per child during a 12 month period of time. The 12 month period will begin on the date that the child was placed in the resource provider’s home. The 12 units will reset upon the one year anniversary date of the child’s placement. Unused units from the previous 12 month period are not rolled over to the new 12 month period. Local staff will be responsible for tracking the number of units. Tracking will be done with the newly developed Respite Unit Tracking Log, CD-113. The capacity of placements the respite provider can have is determined using the information from the CS-RC-2. The resource provider that is only contracted as a respite parent will only provide respite services for a maximum of 6 placements at one time or less depending on the information on the CS-RC-2. Respite for Career Providers Career foster parents are encouraged to use respite care a minimum of one (1) weekend per month plus 14 days per year. Units are calculated as explained in the Guidelines for Use. A child that is determined to be career level on the Alternative Care Information, SS-61, may only be provided respite services by a provider that has a career license with the Children’s Division. The career respite care provider must have a current Agreement for the Purchase of Respite Care for Career Foster Parents, CM-9. The career respite care provider can only provide care for a total of two career level youth at one time including their own career level youth placements. Reimbursement for Respite Care Respite care providers for Legal Status 1 children are reimbursed $20.00 per unit, per child. Career respite care providers are reimbursed $40.00 per unit per child for those children that are classified on the SS-61 as a career level child. The respite payment is processed by the Children’s Service Worker (CSW) via a Children's Services Integrated Payment System Invoice, CS-65. The resource parent will submit the completed Respite Provider Evaluation/Payment Invoice, CD-111, to the CSW within 5 working days of receiving the respite service. The new form, CD-111, provides a uniform process to submit respite units and to monitor the appropriateness of the respite care provider as a respite resource. The worker will make only one payment entry for the respite services per month for the respite care provider. The payment entry using the CS-65 needs to be entered by the last day of the month to ensure timely payment to the provider. A copy of the CD-111 will be retained in the respite care provider’s case file. Case Recording A case file will be maintained by the licensing/resource worker for the respite care provider similar to a resource provider’s file. The outline for the case recording of a respite only resource is provided in Section 4, Chapter 17.9. If the respite care provider is also a licensed resource home (foster, relative, or kinship) the only addition to the typical resource file as defined in Section 5 Chapter 1.6 - Recording Guidelines and Record Composition – Resource Provider Records , will be the respite service specific forms. Resource Parent Discipline Agreement To be in compliance with the Foster Parent Licensing Regulations, all resource parents are to sign the Resource Parent Discipline Agreement, CD-119. The Children’s Service Worker will go over the form with the applicant(s) and be convinced that the applicant understands and agrees to not using corporal punishment and the forms of discipline listed on the form considered to be unacceptable. The Children’s Service Worker will ask the applicant(s) to agree to a positive alternative method listed on the form. The Children’s Service Worker will obtain the signature of the applicant(s) as confirmation of agreement. The worker and the worker’s supervisor will also sign the form.

Foster Care is a form of substitute care for children whose safety or well-being requires they be removed from the home of their parent(s). If the parent of the foster youth resides in the resource home, the foster youth neither is no longer “removed from the control of his parents” per RSM0 211.011 nor is the youth “unattended by parent” per RSMo 210.481(4). Maintenance payments cannot be made to the resource provider if the child’s own parent(s) is residing in the resource home per Federal Child Welfare Policy Manual Section 8.3A.3. The exception to parents of foster youth living in the same resource home as the foster youth is for those parents of foster youth who are also in the legal custody of the Children’s Division. This would also apply to youth who meet the definition of foster care but may not be residing in a resource home such as youth placed in an Independent Living Arrangement or in a Transitional Living Advocate home. In these living arrangements, youth are receiving the maintenance directly but a maintenance payment cannot be paid if the parent resides with the youth as the youth is no longer “removed from the control of his parents” per RSM0 211.011 nor is the youth “unattended by parent” per RSMo 210.481(4).

RELEASE OF INFORMATION TO RESOURCE PARENTS,Missouri,Memo,"2024, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012",Court system,"REGIONAL EXECUTIVE STAFF, CIRCUIT MANAGERS, AND CHILDREN’S DIVISION STAFF","CANDACE A. SHIVELY, DIRECTOR","DISCUSSION: The purpose of this memorandum is to clarify Children’s Division policy regarding information that may be shared with resource parents. The Foster Parent Bill of Rights, 210.566.2(2) RSMo, provides for the licensed resource provider to have pertinent information regarding the foster youth currently placed in their home or the foster youth’s family. This includes full disclosure of all medical, psychological, and psychiatric conditions of the child. The statute also allows foster parents to have access to any information regarding the child or the child’s family including family history of mental or physical illness, sexual abuse perpetrated by the child, criminal background, fire-setting or other destructive behavior or any other information which is pertinent to the care and needs of the child and to protect the foster or adoptive family. Licensed resource parents are members of the professional team, which includes the Family Support Team, FST. Information is shared with the team members to assist in making decisions regarding safety, visitation, service and treatment needs, placement, and other case plan activities. Protected health information covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) may be provided to FST members to assist them in ensuring the child receives the proper care and treatment. Resources providers, as part of the FST, have access to all information shared with other FST members such as juvenile officers, Guardian-ad-Litems, and school personnel. Court Orders and Court Reports Per policy, the resource provider accepting a placement in their home will be provided a copy of the court order placing the foster youth in Children’s Division Custody. The provider shall receive all subsequent court orders while the foster youth is placed in their home until the release of jurisdiction is signed by the judge. The resource provider may also have a copy of the court reports regarding the placement(s) in their home. Other Protected Information Section 191.656.1(e) RSMo, provides that HIV information about a family member may be released to the resource provider. Release of Drug and Alcohol Information is more restrictive than HIPAA. To access information about Drug and Alcohol treatment, an authorization from the individual to disclose must be obtained or a court order specifying the release of this information must be made. Sanctions Resource parents who fail to comply with the privacy policies and procedures of HIPAA policy will be subject to civil and criminal sanctions and disciplinary actions up to and including revocation of license or approval as well as prosecution in a court of law. Disciplinary actions will become part of the resource parents licensing record. Further questions regarding protected information should be submitted to the local privacy officer.

If a legal status 1 foster youth is placed in the home of their stepparent, the placement type is an RHU, unlicensed relative home, not pursuing licensure. If the placement provider is a prior stepparent who is divorced from the child’s natural parent, then the placement type is a KHU, unlicensed kinship home. Stepparents are not eligible for pursuing a foster home licensure; therefore, they are not eligible for maintenance payment. Pursuant to statute 453.400, a stepparent shall support his or her stepchild to the same extent that a natural or adoptive parent is required to support his or her child so long as the stepchild is living in the same home as the stepparent. If the stepparent needs financial assistance, they may apply for TANF benefits. If the stepparent gets divorced from the natural parent, their vendor type changes to a KHU and they may pursue licensure to be eligible for maintenance payment.

Relative and kinship care providers may receive payment for up to 90 days while pursuing licensure. If these providers do not meet licensing criteria within the allotted time frame, they should not receive payment for the period in which they did not meet licensing criteria. Exceptions will be made in those cases where it is clear that they did not meet the licensing criteria through no fault of their own (lost fingerprint results, paperwork not completed by staff, training not scheduled, etc.) The determination of whether a relative or kinship care provider is to be paid past 90 days without licensure being completed will be at the discretion of the Regional Director or designee. Providers that do not meet licensing criteria within the 90 day time frame due to their failure to complete requirements such as physicals and training can not receive payment. Requests for payment to these individuals past the time frame established by policy will be denied. In order to assist relatives and kinship care providers to meet the established time frames, the Relative/Kinship Care Introduction Letter (CD-71) and Relative and Kinship Care Reminder Letter (CD-72) have been developed. The introduction letter (CD-71) should be sent to families at the time of emergency placement of a child into the home or receipt of the referral for licensure. The reminder letter (CD-72) should be sent every 30 days until licensure is achieved or the family chooses to no longer pursue licensure. Copies of these letters should be kept in the provider’s file under correspondence. Staff should begin using these letters effective the date of this memorandum.

Definitions Relative: A person related to another by blood or affinity within the third degree (grandparent, brother, sister, half-brother, half-sister, stepparent, stepbrother, stepsister, uncle, aunt, or first cousin.) RSMo 210.565.2. Kinship: A person who is non-related by blood, marriage or adoption who has a close relationship with the child or child’s family (godparents, neighbors, teachers, close family friends, and fellow church members) or a person who has a close relationship with the child or child’s family and is related to the child by blood or affinity beyond the third degree. Non-safety Licensing Standard Waivers The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act, H.R. 6893, allows for the waiver of non-safety licensure standards for relatives on a case by case basis. A focus group met to discuss non-safety licensing standard waivers for relative providers. As a result, the following non-safety licensing standards, as promulgated in the Licensing of Foster Family Homes, Title 13CSR Division 35 Chapter 60, may be waived with Regional Office approval on a case-by-case basis to license a relative provider: Capacity; 13 CSR 35-60.020 (1)(2)(3) Age of the foster youth; 13 CSR 35-60.020 (2) Age of Foster Parent(s); 13 CSR 35-60.030 (1) Health of Foster Parent(s); 13 CSR 35-60.030 (A)(B) Training; 13 CSR 35-60.030 (B) Physical Standards; 13 CSR 35-60.040 (A)(B) Sleeping Arrangements; 13 CSR 35-60.040 (A)(D)(E)(F) Personal space for clothing and belongings. 13 CSR 35-60.040 (H) Approval Process Utilizing the Non-Safety Licensing Standards Waivers When a recommendation to approve a relative provider is based on utilizing the allowable non-safety licensing standard waivers, the recommendation must include clear documentation that utilization of the waiver(s) will not affect the safety and well being of the foster youth. Each time non-safety licensing standard waivers are utilized to license a relative resource provider, they must be tracked using the Non-Safety Licensing Standard Waivers for Licensing of Relative Resource Provider Homes Tracking Form, CD-152. The CD-152 shall be completed within 5 working days of licensure of the home and submitted to the Practice and Professional Development Unit in Central Office in Jefferson City. When a recommendation is to deny licensure of the relative provider, the denial must be based on non-compliance and/or incapability of meeting the required licensing rules. If the non-safety licensing standard waivers could not be utilized to approve the licensure, there must be clear documentation that the safety and well being of the foster youth would be compromised if an allowable waiver was used. The relative provider may appeal the denial of the waiver utilizing the appeal process . The policy revisions are effective upon the publication of this memo.

The Children’s Division (CD) now has the capability to search in Missouri only for a biological parent, step parent, adoptive parent, legal guardian, or a relative of a child in the custody of the CD whose identity or location is unknown. Designated personnel have been authorized limited inquiry access to DOR’s Division of Motor Vehicle (DMV), General Registration (GRS) and Marine electronic systems to complete location searches. ACCESS: Pursuant to the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act (DPPA) of 1994, 18 U.S.C. SS2721, information accessed through motor vehicle or driver’s license records is highly confidential and restricts public disclosure of personal information contained in DMV records. Designated staff shall abide by all federal laws and state statutes, common law and the Code of State Regulations of the State of Missouri relating to the access and use of these systems. Those designated staff shall also maintain all documentation for a minimum of five (5) years, as required by the DPPA, and make them available to the motor vehicle division upon request. The DMV system can only be accessed for CD business purposes. Access for any other purpose other than what is stated in the terms of the contractual agreement is forbidden and could result in disciplinary action, up to and including suspension, dismissal, and civil or criminal court action. Designated staff are not to disclose confidential driving records to anyone without a business-related need to know.

PROTOCOL FOR REQUESTING A SEARCH: Staff must first proceed with their regular methods of locating an absent parent through the completion of the CS-IV-E Eligibility referral process upon a child entering CD custody. Staff should refer to those steps identified in Section 4, Chapter 4, Attachment A of the Child Welfare manual before requesting designated personnel to begin their enhanced search. Throughout the life of a case, the identity of an absent parent or relative may be identified whose whereabouts are unknown. Staff may request their designated staff perform a search of the DMV screens to locate those individuals by completing the CD88 REQUEST FOR LOCATION SERVICES form. (Form and Instructions are attached.) A search will not be performed without the completion of the CD-88. This new form was designed specifically for staff to use as a tool to assist in completing and documenting their reasonable efforts to perform a diligent search to locate absent parents or relatives, as required by the Program Improvement Plan (PIP), Council on Accreditation (COA) and House Bill 1453. Record searches may be conducted in the DMV, GRS or Marine systems in a variety of ways, such as by: Name (last, first) Social Security Number (SSN) Driver’s license number, License plate number, Vehicle identification number (VIN) If only a partial name, SSN, or driver’s license number exists, the system may still be searched. Once the authorized staff person completes the search, the only information supplied to the worker will be the information provided on the form, and staff should not request other information which may be included in the system as this violates the contractual agreement. No personal information regarding the individual’s driving record will be provided to the worker due to the highly confidential nature of the systems. NOTIFICATION PROCEDURE When a search is successful the worker should contact the individual by means of a certified, registered letter. Due to the confidential nature of a child’s case, no identifying information should be provided in the letter. The letter may state that the individual’s name was provided to our agency as a parent or relative to a child in our custody as a possible placement resource. If the individual responds to the letter, the worker should verify their identity (by age/social security number/date of birth, or other identifying information as documented on the CD-88). Once the individual’s identity has been verified, the child’s identity can be released. If the individual desires to be considered as a placement resource, staff should proceed by completing a background check on the individual. DOCUMENTATION Case managers should document all information in the Assessment and Treatment section of their case files and file the form in the Forms Section.

CS-1 REVISIONS AND CHANGES IN POLICY RELATED TO APPROPRIATE ASFA PERMANENCY OPTIONS,Missouri,Memo,2003,"Administrative process, Legal process, Moves while in care, Permanency, Placement","AREA EXECUTIVE STAFF, CIRCUIT MANAGERS, AND CHILDREN’S SERVICE STAFF","FREDERIC M. SIMMENS, DIRECTOR","REFERENCE: CHILDREN’S SERVICES Discussion: The purpose of this memo is to introduce the revised CS-1, Child Assessment and Service Plan, and provide information about changes in policy related to appropriate ASFA permanency options. How were the CS-1 revisions made? The revisions to this form are based on feedback received through the Policy Review Team Process. Through this process, all comments and recommendations made by Children’s Services frontline and administrative staff, the Office of State Courts Administrator (OSCA), Juvenile Court personnel, GAL’s, and CASA’s regarding the CS-1 were considered and carefully evaluated during development. Additionally, the revised CS-1 was “tested” in three sites across the state. The end result of everyone’s hard work is a document that meets strict federal requirements but is flexible enough to meet individual circuit requirements. The CS-16 and the CS-1 Best social work practice dictates that thorough assessments of the family and child must be done prior to development of the service plan. Needs and strengths identified during assessment, are the basis for service planning with a family. Data from the Peer Record Reviews and Practice Development Reviews (PDR’s) demonstrate there can be disconnect between assessments and the service plans developed with families. The Council on Accreditation (COA) site reviews further illustrated the need for improvement in policy and field practice. With these facts in mind, policy and practice regarding the CS-1 were examined in depth. Although the previous version of the CS-1 called for a great deal of information gathering, the flow of the form made using the information for the purpose of service planning a cumbersome task. For this reason, the “family assessment” part of the former CS-1 was removed entirely, with the exception of basic demographic family data. The new CS-1 is now a child specific form, as is federally required, which assesses the child’s individual safety, permanency, well-being needs. The family assessment is to be done by completing the CS-16. These forms compliment and partner with each other and both are to be completed when working with a family whose child(ren) is in out-of-home care. The CS-16 is currently undergoing revisions so that the formatting of both tools is the same and information gathered in the CS-16 will easily transfer to parts of the CS-1. CS-1 Enhancements CS-1 as a Court Report The CS-1 has been redesigned so that information gathered and entered into the document logically leads to summary sections which can be quickly located in the document and utilized by the court. These summary sections are outlined in bold throughout the document. When properly completed, these summary sections should provide most, if not all, of the critical information the court will need during a review: child and family data, summary of reasonable efforts to prevent placement, summary of reasonable efforts to facilitate reunification and provide permanency, summary of visitation, and summary of appropriateness and child/youth adjustment to placement. In the event the court needs more detailed information about the summary sections, that information can easily be found in the document right before each summary section. The final two sections of the CS-1, FST (Family Support Team) Data and Recommendations and the Written Service Agreement, are also outlined in bold for quick identification by the court. Ideally, the court will accept a completed CS-1 as a court report. In circuits where the CS-1 is not accepted as a court report, the summary sections (when completed according to forms instructions) can easily be cut and pasted into a narrative report for the court. CS-1 as an Electronic Document The CS-1 has been redesigned to be a dynamic form. In other words, the CS-1 grows as information is continuously added over the life of the division’s involvement with the child. The CS-1 will no longer be printed and stored at the warehouse but will be stored electronically on the computer hard drive. After a CS-1 for a child is initially created, that CS-1 can be saved and retrieved later. In any subsequent CS-1, only new information or information which has changed must be entered in the document. The new electronic CS-1 has “Add” buttons embedded in eight locations within the document. Clicking on these “Add” buttons allows additional lines to easily be added to the form making it “grow” as additional space is needed for future case information. The “Add” buttons allow the addition of new family members, service information, relative/kin options explored, placements, FST participants, and goals and tasks over the life of the division’s involvement with the child. When a reviewer of any kind retrieves the most recent CS-1 from the case file, they will be able to quickly see all the primary details for that individual child. In the cases where TPR must be pursued, most information needed can be easily located in last CS-1 because it has been gathered and entered. System Requirements for the CS-1 In order to be able to use all the features of the new electronic CS-1, staff must have MS Office XP (2002) installed on their computer. This is the standard version all Children’s Division staff should have installed. If this is not the version of Word installed on your computer, please contact your local Regional Site Coordinator (RSC) or Area Technical Coordinator (ATC) for assistance. . Standardized Permanency Options The ASFA statute specifies five permanency options, in order of preferred legal permanency, for children who are in alternative care: Reunification, Adoption, Guardianship, Placement with a Fit and Willing Relative, and Another Planned Permanent Living Arrangement (APPLA). These permanency options and language are also included in the Missouri Supreme Court's Resource Guide for Best Practices in Child Abuse & Neglect Cases. In an effort to standardize the language used when discussing permanency for children, these permanency options have been added to the revised CS-1 in the FST Data and Recommendations section. Next to ensuring safety, meeting a child’s permanency needs is the single most important function performed by our agency. Permanency planning permeates every aspect of the child's placement in out-of-home care. The goal of out-of-home care is to provide to every child a stable and continuous relationship with nurturing adults. Acceptance of this goal implies that no child should be allowed to drift in out-of-home placement. The child should either be reunified with his/her parents or be freed from parental custody and placed for adoption within a definite time limit. When neither of these alternatives are possible, one of three plans is utilized to secure permanency for the child; Legal Guardianship; Placement with a Fit and Willing Relative; or Another Planned Permanent Living Arrangement (APPLA). Three of the permanency options; Reunification, Adoption, and Guardianship; are already addressed in current policy. Revisions to the forms instructions for the CS-1, Child Welfare Manual (CWM) Table of contents, CWM Section 4 Chapters 8, 9, 10, 12, 23, and Chapter 23 Attachment A reflect the addition of the other two permanency options to policy. Placement with a Fit and Willing Relative Choosing this option is appropriate when it is documented for the court that compelling reasons exist which make all other permanency options unacceptable. Relative placement does not prevent adoption or guardianship . If the child is with a relative who wishes to care for the child long-term, adoption and guardianship should still be explored as they offer more permanence than simple placement through the court. Additionally, a relative placement need not take precedence over a stable placement with another individual who may wish to adopt or become the child’s guardian. This permanency option should be selected only under these circumstances: Return home has been ruled out; TPR and adoption or guardianship are not appropriate and the juvenile court and/or Division feels it is in the best interest of the child not to pursue termination; All relatives have been considered and there is an identified relative resource who is willing to make a permanent commitment to care for the child; The relative resource is able to meet the child’s physical, emotional, and developmental needs; The child wants to be placed with the relative; The relative has been fully informed of the legal effect of the placement and all available financial resources, including adoption or guardianship subsidies; The parent(s) has been informed about the placement of the child with relative provider; If the relative plans on continuing contact with the parent from which the child was removed, they are prepared to protect the safety of the child and make decisions that enhance child’s well-being about the child’s contact with this parent; Placement with a fit and willing relative, without adoption or guardianship, is not a legally final permanency option . Therefore, the court must continue to hold annual permanency hearings until the court enters a legally final permanency order (return of child to legal custody of parent, TPR and adoption or guardianship) or the child reaches age 21. Another Planned Permanent Living Arrangement (APPLA) APPLA is the least preferred permanency option. This option is a specific permanent placement for the child, not just a foster care placement that can be indefinitely extended. Choosing this option is appropriate when it is documented for the court that compelling reasons exist which make all other permanency options unacceptable and not in the best interests of the child. Examples include when there is a significant bond, but the parent cannot care for the child due to disability; and when an Indian tribe has identified an APPLA for the child. An APPLA should be selected as the most appropriate permanency option only under these circumstances: Return home has been ruled out; TPR and adoption or guardianship are not appropriate; The child objects to TPR, and the juvenile court and/or Division believes it is in the best interest of the child not to pursue termination; Placement with a Fit and Willing Relative has been ruled out; There is an identified appropriate planned permanent living arrangement in which the child wishes to continue living; All possible additional services are explored with the child and/or the placement provider to provide permanency; The out-of-home care provider will make a formal Planned Permanency Agreement with the Division for this purpose. As with Placement with a Fit and Willing Relative, an APPLA is not a legally final permanency option. It is subject to ongoing court review. Therefore, the court must continue to hold annual permanency hearings until the court enters a legally final permanency order (return of child to legal custody of parent, TPR and adoption or guardianship) or the child reaches age 21. Just as court hearings should explore more permanent options for the child, members of the FST should continue to explore ways in which the child’s permanency and stability can be enhanced. To summarily rule out more permanent options based on the child’s age or needs is contrary to the goals of ASFA . Individual determinations about each child’s needs and circumstances are necessary. The following do not qualify as an APPLA: Extended Out-of-Home Care or Long-Term Foster Care. The ASFA statute explicitly prohibits long-term foster care as a permanency option. This is not considered a permanent living situation for a child. Long-term foster care is not stable and may disrupt, often leading to frequent moves and instability for the child and instability. All language in the CWM which refers to Extended Out-of-Home Care has been removed. Emancipation. Emancipation is unfortunately what sometimes happens when children leave foster care. It is not a permanency goal because it lacks certain permanency features contemplated by APPLA. Emancipation implies a discharge from foster care simply by virtue of one’s age without the necessary support system to provide sustained stability for the youth. Independent Living. Independent Living is a set of services provided to a youth, not a permanency goal. A youth’s APPLA may include independent living classes and other services as part of their permanent plan. An APPLA implies not just simply making a youth “independent”, but implies a broader plan that includes a support system the youth can continue to access while in care as well as once they are no longer in custody.

SS-61 Goal Codes The permanency option selected on the CS-1 must match the goal selected in field 16 of the SS-61. Revisions to the SS-61 fields are currently in progress. Until such time that the SS-61 fields and code sheet can be updated and as of October 1, 2003, staff should use code 06 in field 16 for Another Planned Permanent Living Arrangement and code 08 for Placement with a Fit and Willing Relative. Code 04, Long Term Foster Care, should no longer be used for any child in Out-of-Home Care. Revisions to the SS-61 code sheet reflecting this change will be forthcoming. The Planned Permanency Agreement Previously called the “Extended Out-of-Home Care Agreement”, a Planned Permanency Agreement should be completed whenever either of the two permanency options, Placement with a Fit and Willing Relative or APPLA, is selected for a youth.

The description of the child should include the child’s strengths and his/her endearing qualities, not simply problem identification, as this is intended to help inform resource parents of the full picture of the child. Information to include in the description includes but is not limited: to social, academic, behavior accomplishments; successes; positive family interaction; sibling support; helpfulness; respectful attitudes; politeness; creativity; and healthy self-image. As additional information is available (i.e. court reports), it is to be given to the resource parent. This record is to be maintained throughout the placement and follows the foster youth throughout their time in alternative care. The resource parent is not to keep a copy of the record once the child has moved or has left their home. The record is returned to the local office when the child is released from jurisdiction of the division. The documents in the file are placed in the foster youth’s file at the local office. Contents of the record should include: Foster youth’s name, birth date, date of placement, county of original jurisdiction, placement county, case manager’s name and telephone number and an afterhours telephone number for the case manager. Full name and address of the biological and/or legal parent(s) and other interested and responsible relatives where appropriate. All medical and dental information, including but not limited to diseases, surgical history, allergies, immunizations, psychosocial history and mental health history. In addition, the regulation requires the foster youth’s school records, rewards, pictures, church records, or any special items that will help to document the child’s background. The foster youth’s worker shall provide this record to resource parents and potential adoptive parents. The record shall accurately describe all pertinent information including but not limited to full disclosure of all medical, psychological, and psychiatric conditions of the child. It should also include information from previous placements that would indicate that the child(ren) may have a propensity to cause violence to any member of the resource family home. The resource parents shall be provided with any information regarding the child or child’s family, including but not limited to the case plan, any family history of mental or physical illness, sexual abuse of the child or sexual abuse perpetrated by the child, criminal background of the child or the child’s family, fire-setting or other destructive behavior by the child, substance abuse by the child or child’s family, or any other information which is pertinent to the care and needs of the child and to protect the foster or adoptive family, per Section 210.566, RSMo.

This list will be updated and mailed out annually by the licensing Children’s Service Worker; An emergency communication plan. This plan, which is part of each Circuit’s overall disaster plan, should include who shall be contacted in cases of emergencies. In cases where there is a man-made or natural disaster, a communication center in a different Region from the affected Region shall be set up as a communication center as a back-up for the Regional/Circuit office. The selected Children’s Division (CD) office should be far enough away that it is unlikely to be directly affected by the same event. The administrative number at the Child Abuse/Neglect Hotline, 877-642-6320, shall begiven to each foster parent to use only when all other usual means of communication are down which preclude foster parents from contacting their local/regional contacts. Please note: a written protocol should accompany this number which shall spell out when this administrative number is to be used; this information will be included in the local circuit’s protocol that is to be shared with foster parents. Each Region will designate an individual/group of staff who will coordinate information received from the disaster affected Region and communicate this information to the Regional Directors and Central Office. The protocol should include instructions that all staff in the affected area shall call into the designated communication center. The foster parent guidelines for responding to emergencies, as referenced earlier, shall include the 1-877-642-6320 administrative number to be used only when no other communication channels are available to reach local/regional contacts. This plan shall include: Who to contact at the local and regional level during an emergency situation, during normal work hours as well as after hours; Who to contact during man-made or natural disaster when all normal communication channels are down, i.e. administration number 877-642-6320. This plan will also include how the foster parent will contact the communication center when normal communication is down, i.e. use of cell phones, messages through established web pages; Who will contact the Birth Parent/Relative, Children’s Division Director, and the Juvenile Office, regarding the child’s emergency situation; How often foster parent/staff shall communicate with the designated communication site during man-made or natural disasters, i.e. daily, weekly etc; The information to be provided regarding emergency situations; How and where in the case record the information is to be documented; How it will be monitored; Address voluntary or involuntary closure of facilities in emergency situations; Address the requirement of notifying the person’s parent or legal guardian and other appropriate authorities; Any additional requirement as specified by the Regional Office. In the event of a mandatory evacuation order, foster parents must comply with the order insofar as they must ensure their foster children are evacuated according to the plan and procedures set forth by the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA). Additionally, in the event of emergency, the Department of Social Service’s Communications Office will coordinate all communication with the media, leadership staff, personnel, persons served and the public. Foster Parents’ Responsibilities: Foster parent shall develop and display a family emergency plan that will be approved by their local office and become part of their Family Development Plan. Their plan should include the following: An evacuation plan for various disasters; A meeting place for all family members if and when a disaster occurs; Contact numbers which shall include: Local law enforcement; Regional Communication Plan with Contact Personnel; Emergency Numbers; Administrative number, 877-642-6320, only to be used when no other local/regional communication channels are available. A disaster supply kit that includes “special needs” items for each household member, first aid supplies including prescription medications, a change of clothing for each person, a sleeping bag or bedroll for each foster child, battery powered radio or television, extra batteries, food, bottled water and tools. For information regarding what to place in an Disaster Kit you may go to “American Red Cross Disaster Plan Kit Item list” www.redcross.org As part of the disaster plan each foster parent will identify what will happen to the child if he/she is in school or the foster parent is away from the child; i.e. will the school keep the children until a parent or designated adult can pick them up or send them home on their own. Foster parents will provide their Children’s Service Workers with back-up contact phone numbers in case of emergency in which they cannot be located by their home or work phone. Foster parents should consider providing staff with back-up phone numbers of individuals (such as relatives) they would contact in case of an emergency. Each foster home will review this plan with their foster children every six months and report this information back to the foster child’s respective case worker. The worker will record this information in the provider’s file. The emergency plans shall be made available through the Regional Office, upon request. NECESSARY ACTIONS: Please review this memorandum with all Children’s Division Staff. All comments and recommendations regarding this subject should be cleared through normal supervisory channels.

HARRISON, ACTING DIRECTOR","DISCUSSION: The purpose of this memorandum is to explain the Fair Hearing process and introduce the new Children's Division Fair Hearing forms. Effective with this memorandum, the Application for State Hearing, IM-87, will no longer be used for Children's Division Fair Hearings. The new Application for Fair Hearing, CD53, will be used for all grievances made by a Children's Division applicant or provider who disagrees with a decision regarding the Children's Division services listed below. Those individuals who have grievance regarding Family Support Division services will continue to use the IM-87 form. The Application for Fair Hearing, CD-53, is to be used by an applicant who is dissatisfied with the action taken on their application or by a provider who disagrees with a proposed action on their license or subsidy. A hearing may also be requested if the claimant believes a change in subsidy benefits should have occurred. The Fair Hearing process is to be used for the following: Foster/Relative/Kinship Home License Denial/Suspension/Revocation Adoptive Home Denial Adoption Subsidy Maintenance Denial/Change Adoption Subsidy Services Denial/Change Legal Guardianship Subsidy Denial Residential Child Care and/or Child Placing Agency License Denial, Revocation or Suspension Fair Hearing Process To initiate the fair hearing process, the foster/relative/kinship/adoptive or foster/adoptive care applicant/provider must notify the Children’s Service Worker in writing within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Notification of Resource Home Adverse Action, CS-20a, indicating the request for a Fair Hearing. CD-53 and the Withdrawal of Request for Fair Hearing, CD-54, will be in the same mailing as the CS-20a. The worker will attempt to resolve the issue with the applicant informally while concurrently preparing for the Fair Hearing. The worker shall arrange an administrative review within ten (10) working days of receipt of the request. Participants in the meeting should include the resource provider, the Circuit Manager/Designee, appropriate Regional Director/Designee and Supervisor. The purpose of this meeting is to: Review information provided by the applicant or resource provider and Division staff to see if the issue can be resolved prior to filing a request for a Fair Hearing. Once the Children’s Service Worker has received a written request from the resource provider requesting a Fair Hearing, the Children’s Service Worker shall advise the Regional Director/Designee of this request and automatically forward the CD-53 to the Hearings Unit at Division of Legal Services (DLS) within one (1) working day after the date of the hearing request. The worker will also submit a Hearing Packet which includes three copies of the CD-53, a copy of the recommendation summary and the adverse action letter. To expedite the hearing process, the worker must ensure the CD-53 is complete with accurate information and includes all necessary signatures. The Children’s Service Worker shall provide one copy of the case record materials that directly relate to the action upon request to the applicant/resource provider. The worker shall complete the CD-53 for the applicant if requested. If the worker completes the CD-53, the worker must be specific as to the reason a hearing is being requested. The applicant does not need to sign the form prior to the request being forwarded to the DLS Hearings Unit; however, the applicant's signature must be obtained prior to the actual hearing. The immediate supervisor’s signature is required. DLS Hearing Unit will require the county office to obtain a signed Withdrawal of Request for Hearing, CD-54, from the household, before the matter can be withdrawn. Withdrawal of Request for Hearing This memorandum also introduces the new Withdrawal of Request for Fair Hearing, CD-54. This form will be completed when the provider or the Children's Division requests a Fair Hearing withdrawal. This would include: The claimant is requesting withdrawal from a previously requested hearing; or The Children's Division determines that information is inadequate to support the agency’s proposed action and the agency wishes to rescind the decision. The worker should immediately send the completed and signed Withdrawal of Request for Hearing, CD-54, to the DLS Hearing Unit within one (1) working day. This form will replace the Withdrawal of Request for Hearing, IM-90, for withdrawal from a Children Service’s Fair Hearing. Form Revision The Notification of Resource Home Adverse Action, CS-20a, and Notification Letter for Adoption and Guardianship Subsidy Denial, CD-87, have been revised to correspond with policy changes effective with this memorandum.

The process of drafting the Home Assessment is a positive engagement experience between the resource development worker and the applicant. The relationship of the resource development worker with all the household members of a resource home is important for cultivating mutual respect and monitoring a safe and nurturing environment for foster youth. The mutual assessment process provides an opportunity for the worker to build positive and beneficial relationships with the resource home members and to offer help to the resource family. The worker is in the home to help maintain and support the resource family. The home assessment process is conversational allowing for the sharing of concerns, strengths and needs, and development of a mutual relationship of trust. The meaningful conversations include pertinent issues and understanding of licensing requirements. The relative or kinship Home Assessment is written specifically to address the appropriateness and best interest for the specific foster youth to be placed in the home and to affirm licensing standards are met per 13 CSR 35-60 RSMo .

FAMILY FIRST PREVENTION SERVICES ACT; RESOURCE HOME CAPACITY LIMITS,Missouri,Memo,"2024, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019",Administrative process,CHILDREN’S DIVISION AND CONTRACTED STAFF,"DAVID B. KURT, DIRECTOR","DISCUSSION: The purpose of this memorandum is to introduce changes to the number of children allowed in a resource parent home in compliance with Family First Prevention Services Act, FFPSA. The FFPSA places a limitation of six (6) children per resource family household. Missouri Foster Family Home Licensing Rules and Children’s Division Policy are compliant with the limitation as Missouri, to be in compliance with Council on Accreditation, COA, has set the limit to 5. In an effort to provide the most appropriate care and to maintain familial relationships, FFPSA and the Children’s Division allow an exception to the limit of 5 children in a home to accommodate the following situations: To allow a parenting youth in foster care to remain with their child; To allow siblings to remain together; To allow a child with an established meaningful relationship with the family to remain with the family; and To allow a family with special training or skills to provide care to a child who has a severe disability. The Home Assessment process includes discussion with and the assessment of a resource parent regarding how many children the resource parent is willing and able to care for effectively and safely. The Home Assessment must include information regarding the physical standards of the home to accommodate a large sibling group and the resource parent(s) willingness as well as their parenting skills to care for a large foster sibling group as well as the other children in the home. The decision to make an exception allowing the resource home to go over the limit of five children using one of the four considerations listed above, must be approved by the resource licensing worker and the resource licensing supervisor. The Traditional Resource Home Capacity Exception Approval Tracking Form, CD-157, must be signed by the resource licensing worker and resource licensing supervisor. The form is placed in the resource case file and a copy emailed to Central Office for tracking purposes. Resource homes shall not be licensed for the number of total children to exceed five. The limit of five includes an accounting for the number of children of the resource parents. For example: the resource family has 2 children living in the home, therefore, the maximum capacity for foster youth placement is 3. If the family is willing, capable and has the physical capacity to accommodate a sibling group of more than 3, written approval to exceed the limit of 5 children in the home must be obtained. The request to exceed the limit of 5 will include how the resource is able to parent the large number of children in the home. When an exception to exceed five children in a home is approved, no additional children shall be placed in the home until the home is under the maximum of five. The Current Policy of Large Family Resource Homes, LFRH, Section 6 chapter 15, is discontinued with the publication of this memorandum. Homes which are currently approved as a LFRH must be placed on Administrative Hold. No more placements may be made in the home. The home must meet the regulation requirement of 5 children in the household by April 1, 2019, or an approved CD-152 for relative providers or CD-157 for non-related resource providers for the continued care of siblings must be present in the case file.

RESOURCE HOME LICENSE RENEWAL,Missouri,Memo,"2024, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014","Administrative process, Adoption, Foster parent licensing","REGIONAL DIRECTORS, FIELD SUPPORT MANAGERS, CIRCUIT MANAGERS, AND SUPERVISORS","TIM DECKER, DIRECTOR","DISCUSSION: The purpose of this memorandum is to introduce a communication tool to assist staff with timely license renewal of resource homes, License or Approval Renewal Reminder, CD-102 for you to share with your staff. The policy revision and tool creation was drafted in collaboration with Children’s Division Circuit Managers, Supervisors, Field Support Managers and the Missouri State Foster Care and Adoption Board. A license to provide alternative care or an approval to provide alternative care services Elevated Needs Level A, Elevated Needs Level B, Elevated Needs Medical, Respite and Adoptive resource is issued for a two year period. If the license or approval is not renewed before the expiration date, the license or approval will expire. An active license or approval and the correct corresponding cooperative agreement entered in FACES are necessary for maintenance (MAIN) payments. Maintenance payments may only be generated if the License or Approval, Cooperative Agreement, and placement type for the service correlate. The resource licensing worker makes quarterly home visits with the resource family to discuss parenting strengths and challenges, training needs, safety concerns and compliance with foster family home licensing rules. The engagement during each quarterly visit should facilitate the continuation of the resource family maintaining the requirements to remain licensed. When the worker makes the final quarterly visit prior to license renewal there should be minimal requirements remaining for the resource family to complete. The policy introduction in 2008 which allowed placing a resource home on Administrative Hold due to not completing all license or approval renewal requirements prior to the expiration date is revised with this memorandum. All licenses and approvals must be renewed prior to the expiration date. If all renewal requirements have not been met by 90 days prior to expiration date, the CD-102 is sent to the resource family reporting the requirements necessary for the home to be renewed before it is closed due the expired license/approval. Space is provided on the letter to enter details of renewal tasks which family members may still need to complete. The fingerprinting authorization letter which provides the registration number for scheduling a fingerprinting appointment should be sent with the 90 day reminder letter. Please use this opportunity to communicate, in writing, with the resource family the specific tasks needed for re-licensure. If there are foster children/youth in the home, discussion around alternative planning between the licensing worker, case manager, and resource parent should begin 90 days prior to the expiration date, in the event that the license is not renewed. Foster children/youth may not reside in an unlicensed foster home without a court order. The only exception is when a foster youth is placed initially in a relative or kinship applicant’s home who is pursuing licensure. Foster placements may remain in the unlicensed relative or kinship home for up to 90 days while the applicants are pursuing licensure. If the home continues to not meet renewal requirements, the CD-102 should be sent again at 60 days prior to the expiration date. If the resource provider is demonstrating reluctance or resistance to completing requirements for license renewal, a formal review of the home as outlined in Resource Development Policy Section 6 of the Child Welfare Manual should be conducted. The outcome of this meeting will determine if the next step is an adverse closure of the home and the required Resource Home Adverse Action, CS-20a letter sent so that the resource provider has an opportunity to request a Fair Hearing before the license expires. If the home continues to not meet renewal requirements 30 days prior to expiration date, the CD-102 should be sent again and the home placed on Administrative Hold. Level A, Level B, Medical, Group Home, Respite, and Level B Respite, are approved vendor types for foster care services. These are not licenses. The decision to deny or revoke these vendor types is not open for appeal as these are contractual service decisions and not licensure decisions. Placing the resource home on Administrative Hold status does not prevent the license or approval from expiring. It does, however, allow for data entry in the comment section on the Licensure and Approval and Renewal Screen in FACES regarding the facts of why the home is being placed on Administrative Hold. If a court order is obtained to allow the foster youth to remain in the unlicensed resource home, inform the resource family that MAIN and PPMN payments will stop the day after expiration and will not resume until the license/approval is renewed. There will be no MAIN or PPMN while the home is in the unlicensed status. The resource development worker is responsible to inform the resource provider of the cessation of payments once the license expires. Full implementation of the new License or Approval Renewal Reminder letter and revised policy shall be effective two weeks from the publication date of this memorandum. Resource providers placed on Administrative Hold status due to not meeting all requirements for license renewal as policy allowed prior to this revision, may continue to be granted the remaining six month allowed time from when their Administrative Hold status began. For those resource providers who have not met license renewal requirements and their license is due to expire within the 60 days of the publication of the memorandum, their status shall be placed on Administrative Hold as the policy directs. They may be allowed up to 90 days to be compliant with licensing renewal requirements. The policy updates within this memo are effective June 26, 2014.

RESOURCE PROVIDER FINGERPRINTING PROCESS,Missouri,Memo,"2024, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014",Administrative process,"REGIONAL EXECUTIVE STAFF, CIRCUIT MANAGERS, AND CHILDREN’S DIVISION STAFF","TIM DECKER, DIRECTOR","DISCUSSION: The purpose of this memorandum is to introduce clarifications and revisions to the fingerprinting process for individuals who are screened as resource providers for youth in foster care. These clarifications and revisions will be effective April 22, 2014.This memo also serves as a reminder to staff of the correct use of the statute reference required for fingerprints and addresses the Missouri State Highway Patrol (MSHP) audit of Children’s Division use of fingerprint based criminal background check results. Revisions include but are not limited to new registration numbers, new and revised fingerprint authorization letters and the revised Purpose Code X (PCX) Log. MSHP Audit Findings The MSHP’s audit of Children’s Division’s compliance with state and federal statutes regarding fingerprint results is being conducted to meet state and federal guidelines for accessing criminal history record information pursuant to state and federal laws. All Children’s Division staff need to practice the following: Use the correct statute reason for obtaining fingerprintsThere are three statutory reasons that Children’s Division may request fingerprints: Resource provider license or approval – RSMo 210.487 . This includes the following vendor types: FH, Foster Home RH, Relative Home KH, Kinship Home CF, Level B Home FG, Foster Group Home Resource provider approval for individuals who are solely a Transitional Living Advocate, Respite Provider or Adoptive Approved Provider- RSMo 43.540. If the provider has another vendor type listed in paragraph “a”, they do not need additional fingerprints to be approved as TL, RS, RP or AD vendor. The 43.540 statute is for those individuals who only have the TL, RS, RP, or AD vendor type. Purpose Code X (PCX) for the initial emergency placement in a relative or kinship resource home- RSMo 210.482. The fingerprint results from the PCX should be used for the initial licensure of the RH or KH applicant. Additional fingerprints of the RH and KH applicants and required household members to be licensed should not be done again until renewal. However, for the relative and kinship home license renewal, fingerprint requirement statute RSMo 210.487 should be used. A PCX request may be made by CD staff only. Use the correct destruction method of fingerprint results Fingerprint responses and/or results are to be destroyed when subsequent fingerprint results are received for license and or approval renewal. The FBI requires that criminal history records be destroyed so they are not viewable. Records must be shredded or incinerated in order to meet this requirement. Records must be destroyed either by a Children’s Division (CD) employee or in the presence of a CD employee. FBI regulations allow for document shredder contractors to destroy records as long as a CD staff person is present (i.e. done on-site). However, if the document shredder contractor picks up the documents to be destroyed and takes them to another location, this is considered outsourcing and does not meet FBI regulations. Each circuit should have local protocols for staff in regard to the destruction of criminal history records. Use the authorized dissemination process of fingerprint results. Title 28 CFR 50.12 states that records obtained from the FBI may not be disseminated outside of the receiving department. Do not scan and email fingerprint responses or results Do not send fingerprint responses or results out of state Do not provide fingerprint responses or results to other agencies including contractors Do not archive case files with fingerprint responses or results included Do not record the fingerprint responses or results in home assessments Instructions in policy provide the three (3) allowable statements to include in the home assessment regarding the fingerprint history responses or results: Results meet eligibility requirements Results do not meet eligibility requirements Results require further review to determine if applicant is precluded from licensure The CD requester of PCX must provide their full name to law enforcement It is important that CD staff maintain a positive relationship with law enforcement. Law enforcement should know which CD staff might be contacting them for a PCX background check. The Circuit Manager or designee should provide a current list of staff who could request a PCX criminal check to local law enforcement. Purpose Code X When youth are placed in the custody of the CD, Purpose Code X (PCX) must be used by CD to make placement of the youth in an unlicensed relative or kinship provider. Only CD staff may request a PCX background check. Once a CD worker requests a PCX background check, the individual(s) for whom the request was made must submit their fingerprints within 15 days of the request. If fingerprints are not submitted within 15 days of the request, the foster youth is to be removed immediately before day16. If the foster youth remain in the home less than 15 days, the individual(s) for whom the request was made must submit fingerprints within 15 days of the foster youth being placed in the home when a PCX request is made to law enforcement. Revised Purpose Code X Request Log, CD-153 The PCX Request Log has been revised to support compliance with state and federal dissemination guidelines. Instructions for completing the PCX Log have been created. This log shall be completed every time a PCX background screening check is requested. Introduction of Two New Fingerprint Authorization Letters The Fingerprint Authorization letters provided to individuals who must register through Missouri Automated Criminal History Site (MACHS) via the MSHP website to schedule their fingerprint appointment are located on the CD Desktop. There are currently the following Fingerprint Authorization Letters for CD staff use: CD26-a; this letter is given to foster, relative, and kinship applicants for initial licensure and license renewal by the authority of RSMo 210.427 CD26-b; this letter is given to natural parents by the authority of HB 1453 which prevents CD from reuniting any child with a parent who, or into household where a household member has, been convicted of specific criminal charges, CD26-d; this letter is given to those resources who are an adoptive resource only. Minor cosmetic revisions have been made to the current authorization letters. The language in the current fingerprinting authorization letters, CD-26a, CD-26b, and CD26-d has been revised. Destroy previously printed letters and begin using the revised letters with publication of this memorandum. The two additional Fingerprint Authorization Letters now available for CD staff only on Desktop CD forms, are the CD-26e and CD-26f: Respite and Transitional Living Advocate providers, CD-26e This document is to be given to those individuals who are respite only or transitional living only providers. The authority for fingerprinting these vendor types is covered in statute 43.540 . If a provider has other vendor types (FH, RH, KH, AD) they do not need additional fingerprints to be approved as a respite or transitional living advocate. Purpose Code X, CD26-f This document is to be given to those individuals whom the CD is screening for emergency placement of youth that have been placed in CD custody. The statutory authority to use this reason for fingerprinting is only for emergency placement. This letter is not used for license renewal. The results of the fingerprints received using PCX authority may be used to initially license a relative or kinship home without another initial fingerprint. Revised Fingerprint Registration Numbers The fingerprinting registration numbers for all 45 circuits have been revised. The previously assigned Registration Numbers will be obsolete and will not work for registration after April 22, 2014. The registration numbers for case management agencies and private agencies to use for their foster care clients to register have not changed. The document listing all the registration numbers is the Fingerprint MACHS Registration Number Sheet, CD26-g. There are five (5) registration numbers for each circuit and two (2) for each private contractor. The correct registration number for the fingerprint reason is entered in the box at the bottom of the authorization letter identified as Registration Number . FACES To be in compliance with FBI regulations regarding the dissemination of criminal history, the language referencing the Criminal Background Checks in FACES has been renamed, Fingerprint Based Criminal Background Check . The result selections in the drop-down box are: Results meet eligibility requirements Results do not meet eligibility requirements Results require further review to determine if applicant is precluded from licensure The language in policy regarding how the fingerprint based results are documented has also been revised to reflect compliance with the FBI. The diligence of staff to use the fingerprinting process correctly within statutory regulations is necessary to retain the ability to complete Fingerprint Based Criminal Background Checks.

"REVISED POLICY, PROCEDURE AND TOOLS RELATED TO CHILD SAFETY ASSESSMENT AND SAFETY PLANNING NEW FORMS: CD-17 AND CD-18",Missouri,Memo,"2024, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011","Administrative process, Definitions, Safety","REGIONAL EXECUTIVE STAFF, CIRCUIT MANAGERS AND CHILDREN’S DIVISION STAFF","CANDACE A. SHIVELY, DIRECTOR","DISCUSSION: The purpose of this memorandum is to introduce staff to revised safety assessment and safety planning policy, procedure, and tools. These revisions were founded largely on the “Framework for Safety” model and material made available by the National Resource Center for Child Protective Services (NRCCPS) ( Action for Child Protection ). NRCCPS also provided technical assistance by reviewing draft policy and providing feedback and recommendations. We’d also like to thank the participation of staff in the five sites that piloted this policy and tools. These include the 1 st , 3 rd , 29 th , and 32 nd Circuits and supervisory groups in the 16 th , 21 st and 22nd Circuits. These sites provided valuable insight into working directly with families which lead to further enhancement of the revised tools. The use of these revised tools and policy in the field will be immediate; however, system modifications to the FACES system are forthcoming. Revised tools used in the field will, therefore, require minor adjustments when entering safety assessment data into the current FACES system. This memo will introduce the tools and policy, and will also describe the necessary adjustments that must be made for FACES entry. Introduction of New Safety Assessment and Safety Planning Tools Safety Assessment (CD-17) – This is a revision of the current safety assessment found in the CPS-1, CD-14 and NCAT. This tool will now also be available as a stand-alone form. Safety Plan (CD-18) – This is a revision of the Safety Assessment Part B (CPS-1A). Minor Revisions - The Family Functioning Assessment/Reassessment (CD-14A) both refer to the current safety assessment and CPS-1A. This tool has been changed to refer to the CD-17 and CD-18. Obsolete Forms - The Safety Assessment Part B (CPS-1A), Safety Reassessment (CS-16D), and the CD-11 Candidate for Out-of-Home Placement Determination will now be obsolete forms. Safety Assessment (CD-17) The purpose of the Safety Assessment (CD-17) is to assess conditions in a household of child safety. Revised definitions of safe and unsafe are based on the Framework for Safety model. They are as follows: Safe - A child can be considered safe when there are no threats of danger to a child within the family/home or when the caregiver’s protective capacities within the home can manage or control threats of danger. Unsafe - A child is unsafe when a child is vulnerable to a threat of danger within a family/home and the caregiver’s protective capacities within the home are insufficient to manage the threat thus requiring outside intervention. Conditionally safe will no longer be an option in the revised tools. Safety decisions marked unsafe now include family conditions previously determined to be unsafe (protective placement) as well as family conditions previously determined to be conditionally safe (identified safety factors with agreed upon in- home safety plans). This provides a clear distinction between the functions of safety assessment and safety planning. Safety assessments are completed in the following circumstances: Initial contact - Investigations/Family Assessment; Initial contact - FCS opening or FCOOHC opening where there are children in the home (unless recently assessed during the investigation or family assessment); At least every 90 days (at the end of a treatment period) - all open FCS cases and all FCOOHC cases for children who are in the home; Any time new information becomes available or the family situation changes which may result in an increased threat of safety for the child regardless of the “type” of case (i.e., CA/N investigation/Family Assessment, FCS, FCOOHC child in trial home placement or home visit, etc). Workers should always be on the alert to changes in the family, new dynamics, the interaction of multiple threats of danger and other “red flags” that indicate that the threat to the safety of a child is no longer manageable. The effective use of the CD-17 is dependent on thorough information collection focused on the Framework for Safety model. The (CD-162) Safety Information Collection Tool (introduced in CD Memorandum CD10-117 ) is designed to guide the workers through the information collection and safety analysis process as well as structuring descriptive documentation of those efforts. Workers will utilize the information collected on the CD-162 to complete the CD-17 Safety Assessment. The CD-17 is composed of the following: Safety Factor Identification Safety Threshold Criteria; and Safety Decision – safe or unsafe Safety Factor Identification is essentially the same list of safety factors contained in the previous safety assessment, except that number 12 “other” has been removed as an option. These factors are general enough to accommodate any threat of danger identified that could result in serious harm to a vulnerable child. If there is no threat of danger, the children are safe. If there is a threat of danger, the question becomes is the caregiver’s protective capacity sufficient to control the threat of danger. This decision is made by applying Safety Threshold Criteria . FACES Entry Adjustments – Number 12 “other” will still be available in FACES under safety factor identification. Workers should no longer use this option. Safety Threshold Criteria refers to the point at which family behaviors, conditions or situations rise to the level of directly threatening the safety of a child. The safety threshold includes only those family behaviors, conditions, or situations that are judged to be out of the parent/caregiver or family’s control. The safety threshold criteria include: Specific and observable – A family condition that exists as an impending danger is observable and can be specifically described or explained. The danger is real, can be seen, can be reported, and is evidenced in explicit, unambiguous ways. Out of control - Family conditions that can directly affect a child are unrestrained; unmanaged; without limits or monitoring; not subject to influence, manipulation or internal power; are out of the family’s control. Likely to cause serious harm - Severity is consistent with anticipated harm that can result in pain, serious injury, disablement, grave/debilitating physical health conditions, acute/grievous suffering, terror, impairment, or death; Present or near future – The belief that threats to child safety are likely to become active without delay, within the immediate future or near future. Safety Decision – The result of safety assessment is a safety decision of safe or unsafe. If the safety decision is unsafe, a (CD-18) Safety Plan is required. If the safety decision is safe, a safety plan is not required. A signature is not required by the family on a safety assessment. FACES Entry Adjustment: Currently the FACES system requires documentation either that the parent signed the safety assessment or refused to sign the safety assessment on all safety assessments. Until FACES changes have be made to accommodate the policy, workers will address the FACES signature requirement as follows: If the safety decision is safe, workers will check the “refusal to sign” button and document in the comment section, “per policy a signature is not required for a safety decision of safe” . CD-18 Safety Plan The (CD-18) Safety Plan is completed only when the safety decision is unsafe . The Safety Plan is made up of safety interventions designed to substitute for insufficient caregiver’s protective capacity or control a threat of danger. They are not designed to effect long term change. Once again the ( CD-162) Safety Information Collection Tool will assist workers by providing a focus on information collection that will be valuable during the development of the safety plan. During the development of safety interventions workers should: Develop safety interventions with input from the caregiver and relevant family members to the maximum extent possible. Utilize the family’s own protective resources first. Utilize safety interventions that are the least intrusive to protect a child. Utilize interventions that have a direct and logical connection between the safety action and the way threats operate in the family. Assess the reliability of sources or providers of the action or supports. (Informal: friend, relative, neighbor or formal: school, agency, program) Assure that people and services identified in the safety plan are accessible and available when threats are present. Develop interventions to accommodate time elements (for example, weekends and holidays may require different actions than daytime hours during the week). Develop overlapping interventions to accommodate scheduling for the source or provider or to address times when the threat is active. Develop protective interventions that address present danger threats or safety interventions that address impending danger. Generally safety interventions should meet the following criteria: Immediately available – can be deployed right now and in sufficient quantity. Action oriented – services that are active and focused with respect to safety factors, not change or treatment related. Flexible access – services that are located in acceptable proximity and can be called upon for immediate response. Immediate impact – services that do what they are supposed to do as they are delivered and achieve the objective to keep children safe. No promissory commitments – having no expectations in safety plans for caregivers complying with or being responsible for protecting their children, promising to protect, or stopping certain behaviors. Safety Interventions will never rely on parental promises to stop the threatening behavior, for example, will stop drinking, or will always supervise the child. Since a criterion for a threat of danger is something out-of-control, it is useless to rely on an out-of-control parent to be in control. Safety interventions should rather provide an alternative action or a third party protective source to assist in controlling the threat of danger. FACES Entry Adjustments – When a safety factor has been identified currently FACES requires the worker to choose the appropriate item from the Safety Response & Interventions section which consists of a list of 8 responses/interventions and a narrative section for the purposes of describing the safety response/intervention. This list of 8 responses still exist in FACES, however, on the new CD-18, this list has been replaced by narrative fields with four headings 1) threats of danger to a vulnerable child 2) caregiver’s protective capacity, 3) safety interventions, and 4) plan for monitoring/verification. Workers will refer to the narrative fields on the CD-18 and choose from the list of 8 response/interventions in FACES that most closely describes the safety interventions developed on the CD-18. The 8 response/interventions in FACES are general enough to apply to any safety intervention utilized on the CD-18. The worker will summarize the specifics of the intervention developed on the CD-18 in the narrative section in FACES. Safety Plan Evaluation Prior to the worker and supervisor signing off on a plan, the worker and the supervisor should assess the feasibility that the proposed interventions will effectively control the identified threats of danger. The worker and the supervisor should ask: Do the safety interventions seem sufficient? Are the safety interventions consistent with the purpose of safety planning? (control threats of danger rather that change them) Does the level of effort and commitment appear to be sufficient by all parties involved to ensure protection? Are there concerns about the time-frames, accessibility or availability related to safety interventions and those involved in the safety plan? Is there a sufficient plan for monitoring and verification of compliance of parties involved, and the effectiveness of the interventions in controlling the threats of danger? Plan for Monitoring and Verification The job of the worker and the supervisor is not complete just because a safety plan has been developed and implemented. The tasks of safety plan monitoring; verification of compliance; and the assessment of the effectiveness of controlling threats of danger is ongoing until the threats of danger are no longer present or the caregiver’s protective capacity increases to the point where it is sufficient to control the threats. What is the plan for monitoring and verification? Is the intervention effective in controlling the threat of danger? Is the source for monitoring and verification credible and reliable? Ultimately the worker is responsible for assuring that the plan is implemented; executed as agreed; and that all parties involved in the plan are compliant. Is there continuity of management/responsibility when cases are transferred from investigator to FCS worker or there is a change in case worker? The worker should be alert to changes in the necessary components of a safety plan. The worker should be alert in case the monitoring or protective source becomes unavailable or unreliable. The worker should be alert to changes in conditions or composition of the household that create new threats of danger, increase a child’s vulnerability or diminish caregiver protective capacity. Safety Plan Re-assessment, Readjustment or Modification of Current Safety Interventions A formal safety assessment begins at initial contact with the family and at various specified points throughout the life of the case; however, workers will assess safety informally on an ongoing basis. Timeframes set to reevaluate interventions should be dependent on the nature of the threat of danger (present danger or impending danger) and the accessibility and availability of protective sources used for the intervention. Safety interventions should be seen as flexible agreements dependent on the effectiveness in controlling the threat of danger. They should be evaluated, readjusted, or modified as needed. Closing out a Safety Plan When threats of danger are no longer present or the caregiver’s protective capacity is sufficient to control the threat of danger, the child is no longer unsafe . Workers will continue to assess safety on an ongoing basis and promote long term changes to family functioning in treatment plans that increase the caregiver’s capacity to protect children from threats of danger. Summary and Conclusion It is the intention of the Division that this new model for child safety will be not only helpful at the time of initial contact during the investigation or family assessment process, but throughout the life of the case and in all program areas. This model represents the most current, state of the art approach to child safety whether we are documenting reasonable efforts in a court report, assessing child safety in an out- of-home setting, making decisions to close family-centered services or reviewing cases for repeat maltreatment or critical events.

Policy and rule regarding resource provider’s emergency preparedness were introduced in 2006 as part of the process for Council on Accreditation compliance. Policy requires that the resource provider review the emergency plan with the foster youth in their home every six months and that the licensing resource worker review and approve the plan every six months. The additional clarifications to policy include: The resource provider has read and understands the Children’s Division’s policy regarding infectious diseases exposure. Information regarding this is located in the Missouri Resource Parent Handbook; The emergency plan specifically addresses the unique needs of each foster youth placed in the home; and The plan is to be updated every six months, not just reviewed, for all and any changes in the home that would affect the household being prepared for emergencies. Such updates would include but not be limited to the unique needs of specific foster placements, the season, etc. Department of Social Services Human Resource Center has a link to Emergency Management and Safety .

PURPOSE CODE “X” SCREENING,Missouri,Memo,"2024, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010","Administrative process, Contact and directory information, Definitions, Foster parent licensing, Legal process","REGIONAL EXECUTIVE STAFF, CIRCUIT MANAGERS AND  CHILDREN’S DIVISION STAFF","PAULA NEESE, DIRECTOR","DISCUSSION: The purpose of this memorandum is to clarify policy and practice, and introduce a log for conducting a Purpose Code “X” screening. This screening is a specific type of criminal background check that uses the Missouri Uniform Law Enforcement System (MULES). Children’s Division (CD) staff typically request a Purpose Code “X” screening to determine the appropriateness of a potential placement for a child who has been taken into emergency protective custody. The Division has received clearance from the Missouri State Highway Patrol (MSHP) to allow for Purpose Code “X” screenings to also be requested in response to exigent circumstances, which involve a child who is already in the care and custody of CD, or where a placement disruption has occurred and a perspective relative or kinship provider has come forward to request placement consideration. Exigent circumstances refer to an emergency, a pressing necessity, or a set of circumstances requiring immediate attention or including situations when: time is of the essence; the health and safety of a child is involved; or, action is necessary to ensure the best interest of the child. Exigent circumstances do not include routine foster or licensed care situations, visitations with relatives or kin, or for the purposes of a child or older youth to attend a sleep-over with friends. Process for Completing a Purpose Code “X” Screening If there is a need to complete a Purpose Code “X” screening for emergency placement or exigent circumstances, staff should adhere to the following process: The Children’s Service Worker or juvenile officer must request the local law enforcement to search the MULES for anyone 17 years old or older residing in the household; In accordance with Section 210.482.2 RSMo, a child should be immediately removed from the home in which he/she has been placed if anyone 17 yearsold or older refuses to provide fingerprints. Fingerprints must be submitted to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with days of the MULES check. To meet that deadline, the CD Worker must provide th placement provider with information to schedule their screening with the contracted electronic fingerprint vendor; The requesting agency will be responsible for maintaining a Purpose Code “X” Log to document the screening and subsequent fingerprinting process. The law enforcement agency is not responsible for ensuring the legitimacy of the request. Law enforcement is required to ensure the requestor is an authorized representative, and upon verification, the inquiry should be performed. Staff shall no longer use Purpose Code “X” background screenings in conjunction with safety planning or the voluntary placements of children by their parents. This would include any case in which a child has not been placed in the custody of CD. The Division could lose the privilege to use Purpose Code “X” background screenings should this practice continue. Staff should use background screenings through FACES, and continue to complete walkthrough observations of household environments to assure the safety and well-being of child(ren). There is a way outside of Purpose Code “X” which can be utilized for the purpose of safety planning with families in response to reported concerns of child abuse or neglect. Law enforcement is able to share criminal history information with the Division during the course of a co-investigation, outside of completing Purpose Code “X” screenings. Local protocols should be established regarding the sharing of this type of information, and staff should ask law enforcement if Purpose Code “X” was used, so CD can log and process those situations. There is no need to log information shared outside of Purpose Code “X”. Documentation of Purpose Code “X” Screenings The Purpose Code “X” Request Log, CD-153, has been developed for local offices to complete and maintain in order to track the use of Purpose Code “X” screenings and the subsequent fingerprinting of those whose background was screened using Purpose Code “X”. Staff will also need to document situations when fingerprints were not completed and the reason they were not completed by indicating “No Placement” on the Purpose Code “X” Request Log. This resource form may be found in the CD Forms folder of your computer desktop. MSHP completes audits to verify the appropriate use of Purpose Code “X” screenings on behalf of the FBI. The Purpose Code “X” Log, CD-153, will be used in response to any such audit. Staff may also need to review appropriate case records if additional information is needed to respond to questions concerning the use of a Purpose Code “X” screening or the subsequent fingerprinting process. Law enforcement is required to ensure that anyone requesting a Purpose Code “X” screening is an authorized representative of an agency entitled to make such a request. Local offices should work with their multidisciplinary teams to establish protocols to fulfill the required verification process.

Current policy requires requesting three (3) personal references for foster/adopt applicants from individuals unrelated to the applicant. Policy has been revised for licensing of relative and kinship homes to also require 3 personal references. Previous policy required five references. The CS-42 has been revised to indicate three (3) unrelated personal references and a space has been added to include an e-mail address. A new directive pertaining to any adult children no longer living in the home has been added to policy. If names of adult children no longer living in the home were submitted by the applicant in Section II on the CS-42, the worker may mail each one a Personal Reference Questionnaire, CS-101f, to provide an opportunity for them to comment. Submission of references by unrelated individuals, the applicant’s employer, the teachers of the family’s own children, and any adult child no longer in the home are helpful tools in evaluating the applicant’s ability to be a successful resource parent for the Division. Failure to receive completed references does not prevent licensure. However, before making the final recommendation, there should be discussion with the applicant regarding lack of submitted references. The lack of returned references should be considered in making the final recommendation for licensure. Staff are to begin using the updated CS-42 upon the date of this memorandum.

Adults sleeping with infants or toddlers and rolling over on them. Unaccustomed tummy sleeping (the infant being placed on or rolling into the tummy position when this is not a position in which the infant typically sleeps.) The Children’s Division is adopting the Safe Sleep recommendations as identified by the American Academy of Pediatrics and will discuss Sleep information that is listed on the Safe Sleep Practices form with resource parents during the initial home visit with the resource parent applicants. All resource parents, including respite providers, will be asked to review and sign the Safe Sleep Practices form, CD-117 . Staff need to have all currently licensed resource parents sign the form at their next quarterly home visit and place it in the forms section of their case file. Staff will ensure that the CD-117 is signed and placed in the case file by June 30, 2009. A Safety Tip regarding Safe Sleep was issued September 18, 2008.

It is required that a resource provider meets all licensing criteria before their license is renewed. If the provider has not met all the criteria as outlined in Section 6 Chapter 3 Attachment D, Guide for Conducting Renewal Assessment, then the provider’s license will be placed on Administrative Hold. As stated in Administrative Hold policy, if no immediate safety risk factors exist to the children that are in the home, the children should not be removed. However, no additional placements will be made in the home until the provider complies with all the license renewal requirements and their license status is removed from Administrative Hold. Policy in the Guide for Conducting Renewal Assessment indicates that the Professional Parenting Payment (PPMN) is suspended while the provider is on Administrative Hold. The suspension of this payment will continue until the resource home’s status is removed from the Administrative Hold. The provider will have a maximum of 6 months to be in compliance with licensing renewal requirements. If requirements are not met, the worker will begin the revocation process as outlined in Section 6 Chapter 3 Attachment D. In order to stop the PPMN payment for those providers who are placed on Administrative Hold due to non compliance with all the license renewal requirements the worker must do the following: Request the Cooperative Agreement for the Purchase of Professional Foster Care Services (CM-14 also known as PP contract) be closed with a reason of “1”. The request is sent via Email to Mary.F.Holterman@dss.mo.gov , the Administrative Office Support Assistant responsible for entering contracts in Contract Management Unit at Central Office in Jefferson City. Please include the vendor name, vendor number (DVN), contract number and date the contract should be closed. Obtain the signature of the resource provider on a Cooperative Agreement for the Purchase of Foster Care Services (AC/CM-3) and send it to the Contract Management Unit in Central Office. A new PP contract can be opened once all of the licensing renewal requirements are completed and documentation is placed in the file. The new PP contract will need to be submitted in order to open the PP contract and resume the PPMN payment. NECESSARY ACTION Review this memorandum with all Children’s Division staff.

The initial FCSR registration form will continue to be completed for new resource provider applicants and sent to the FCSR as described in policy. The on-line access will be utilized in the renewal assessment process. Obtaining Access Each resource/licensing staff member and their supervisor need to complete the MULES (Missouri Uniform Law Enforcement System) Network Security System access form.

Administrative Hold is to be used in responding to certain licensing situations which will more effectively serve resource parents, the Children’s Division and most importantly, the safety of children. All suspensions on the Vendor Licensure/Placement Resource form, SS-60, require notification of an adverse action which is open to appeal. The Administrative Hold status has been added as it reflects a less punitive and less negative connotation and is not open for appeal in the Fair Hearing process. Depending on the nature of the allegation in a Child Abuse and Neglect (CA/N) report and the risk assessment, a provider may be placed on Administrative Hold with a corrective action/support plan implemented and no other children placed in the home until the issue is resolved and the Hold status is removed. If no immediate safety risk factors exist to the children during the investigation/assessment, the children currently in the home should not be removed. If, at the time of the investigation/assessment (I/A), it is determined the child will be removed, either at the request of the resource provider or by the investigator, the Children’s Service Worker (CSW) should be notified in order to schedule a Family Support Team meeting. The Family Development Specialist should be having and documenting their regular, ongoing discussions with the resource provider regarding any licensing concerns prior to a change in their licensing status. Child Welfare Manual (CWM) Section 6 Chapter 3 Attachment B states that written notice, specifying the reasons for denial or revocation shall be provided ten (10) days prior to the effective date of the action. For an Administrative Hold the licensing worker should notify the provider via a phone call as soon as possible. A follow-up letter should then be sent explaining why the Hold is in effect and how it can be removed/resolved. If the Hold was requested by the provider, the licensing worker should follow up with a letter verifying their request. ADMINISTRATIVE HOLD The Administrative Hold is required in the following circumstances: An Out-of-Home investigation (OHI) is under way involving Legal Status 1 children in the resource provider’s home. The Administrative Hold should remain in effect until the investigation is concluded and all corrective actions/support plans, if any, are successfully completed and documented in the record. A CA/N investigation/assessment is under way involving non-Legal Status 1 children in the resource provider’s household. The Administrative Hold should remain in effect until the I/A is concluded and all corrective actions/support plans, if any, are successfully completed and documented in the record. Licensing concerns have been noted and a staffing is under way. The Administrative Hold should remain in effect until all corrective actions/support plans, if any, are successfully completed and documented in the record. A resource provider moving to another county/circuit should be placed on Administrative Hold and not receive any additional placements pending the completion of the license transfer process. The circuit from which the provider has moved should notify the receiving circuit of the change in address and provide necessary information on current placements, and transfer records within one week. The receiving circuit should schedule a home visit within two weeks of notification. After the provider’s new home has been inspected and approved, relicensure should be granted. The Hold status should be removed from the Vendor Licensure/Placement Resource Report, SS-60, and provider records updated to reflect the changes. The resource provider has experienced a significant change (in household composition, health, employment, etc). The Administrative Hold should remain in effect until the provider’s situation has been reassessed and the study has been updated. Every effort should be made to complete these actions within 2 weeks, per the Council on Accreditation (COA). The worker should document all attempts to meet this timeframe, including the provider’s specific actions of noncompliance within that time. The Administrative Hold status is available, but optional in a variety of circumstances, such as, but not limited to: The provider has had a new birth and needs time to adjust. The provider feels they need “a break”. The Family Support Team has recommended that the resource provider cease new placements during the period of adjustment for an adopted child. The resource provider has a biological/adopted child placed in residential care. Per memo CD05-22, no additional children will be placed in the home without the approval of the Circuit Manager (CM) or designee. The guidelines stated in Section 4 Chapter 5 Attachment C should be reviewed and assessed as the provider may need time to work with the child placed in residential care. If there are questions whether an Administrative Hold or Suspend status should be implemented, staff should consult with first or second level supervisors for guidance. SUSPEND/REVOCATION Suspend/Revocation is defined as an action which is taken: In response to a CA/N report or Preponderance of Evidence finding to be applied during the time of the investigation/assessment and the allegation is severe enough to warrant removal of a child. As an action to be taken when revocation is recommended: Suspend/revocation is used whenever children in the home have been found to be in imminent risk. Suspend is used when the resource parent is not complying with licensing requirements and efforts (such as, but not limited to, being placed on Administrative Hold) to remedy the situation have failed (i.e.: refuse to keep training requirements current, refuse to meet licensing standards, or continued non compliance with an Individual Support Plan). Suspend is used when a staffing has been held, and licensing violations are of sufficient magnitude to warrant a recommendation of suspend. Suspend is used during the period of evaluation and consideration of amelioration. UPDATES TO SS-60 FORM, INSTRUCTIONS AND CODE SHEET System changes have been added to Legacy/Production which allow the Administrative Hold code, ‘H’, to be entered in field 27 on the Vendor Licensure/Placement Resource Report form, SS-60, whenever this action is used. The system will no longer allow input of a vendor number for a placement change when that vendor is on Hold or Suspend status. An error message will appear at the bottom of the ZCC3 screen stating the vendor status is either on Hold or Suspended. The SS-60 instructions and code sheet have been updated with the Administrative Hold information. Staff should begin utilizing the new Administrative Hold code “H”, code sheet and instructions and destroy prior versions as of this memo.

Senate Bill 84 increased the fee for requests for criminal history records based on fingerprints from $14.00 to $20.00 effective August 28, 2007. The bill did provide for exceptions for requests required under the provisions of subdivision (6) of section 210.481, RSMo; section 210.487, RSMo; or section 571.101, RSMo. Requests made under these sections, which includes requests for records for the purpose of foster/relative/kinship care licensing, will remain at $14.00. However, it does not provide for an exception for records requested for the purpose of adoption. Thus, the cost for background checks completed for the purpose of adoption has increased to $20.00. The fee for respite providers, parents and family members who are not being printed for the purpose of licensure has also increased to $20.00. A line of information entitled “Reason Printed” has been added to the electronic scan registration letters for foster, relative, kinship, and adoptive parents and applicants. The reason printed for licensing purposes would be 210.487 RSMo. This code would be utilized for all initial background checks and for license renewals. The reason printed for the purpose of adoption would be 43.540 RSMo. This code would be utilized for all background checks completed as part of an adoptive study.

REVISIONS TO THE INTERSTATE COMPACT ON THE PLACEMENT OF CHILDREN (ICPC),Missouri,Memo,2007,"Administrative process, Contact and directory information, Forms - Other, Placement","REGIONAL EXECUTIVE STAFF, CIRCUIT MANAGERS, AND CHILDREN’S DIVISION STAFF","PAULA NEESE, DIRECTOR","DISCUSSION: This memorandum updates staff on federally mandated revisions to the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC). The Safe and Timely Interstate Placement of Children Act of 2006, Public Law (PL) 109-239, establishes more uniform procedures for states to adhere to when children are being placed across state lines. These procedures require changes to the Child Welfare Manual (CWM), ICPC forms, and prompted the need for clarification of placement types for which the Compact does or does not apply, as well as an explanation of Regulations 1 and 7. The ICPC is a legally binding contract among member states approved by the legislatures of all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands as uniform law. The Compact assures the protection of children crossing state lines and ensures they receive the same supports and services as if they remained in their own state. PL 109-239 holds states accountable for the expeditious placement of children into safe, permanent homes across state lines. SAFE AND TIMELY INTERSTATE PLACEMENT ACT/PL 109-239 States are required to complete a foster/adoptive assessment, defined by PL 109-239 within 60 calendar days after the request is received in the ICPC unit in Central Office. The preliminary home assessment does not require the training component or FBI checks, but should evaluate the safety and suitability of placing a child in a prospective foster or adoptive home. Staff must be aware that the preliminary home assessment does not provide authorization for a child to be placed . Once the preliminary home assessment is completed it should be forwarded to the ICPC unit in Central Office and not to the sending state’s worker. After the preliminary home assessment is submitted to Central Office, staff will then proceed with completing the home study as set forth in the CWM, Section 6, Chapter 3 Attachment A, Guide for Conducting Foster/Kinship Family Assessments. The home study must address the extent to which the proposed placement will meet the specific needs of the child, including the child’s safety, permanency and well-being. The home study, including FBI checks, must be completed and returned within 90 calendar days after the State received the original request. The CSW should submit the original and two (2) copies of the completed home study along with a recommendation for or against placement. The ICPC Coordinator will make the decision whether or not the placement is approved. (The timeframe of 120 days as noted in CWM Section 6, Chapter 3, Attachment A applies only to in-state home studies and not to ICPC home studies.) This procedure does not apply to parents and unlicensed relatives. Parents and unlicensed relatives will go through the same home study format as an applicant applying for licensure, which is clarified in Memorandum CD04-63 and in the CWM Section 6, Chapter 3, Attachment A. The differences are that parents and unlicensed relatives are not required to complete training, and the timeframe for completing their assessment/home study is 60 days. Any child subject to an ICPC referral may not be moved by the sending state without the approval of the receiving state’s ICPC office. The ICPC Coordinators in each state are responsible for ensuring that requests and documentation are processed in accordance with the federal guidelines and timeframes. PLACEMENT TYPES CLARIFICATION The Compact applies when children are to be placed in the following settings: Interstate adoptive placement; Interstate placement for care into relative/kinship placements, foster homes, group homes, and/or residential treatment; Interstate placement with parents and relatives when there is court jurisdiction; Interstate placement of adjudicated delinquents only when placement is sought for residential treatment. The Compact does not apply when placement is sought under any of the following circumstances: Interstate placement from birth parent to birth parent, when there is no court jurisdiction; Interstate placement from birth parent to relative (as defined in RSMo 210.620 Article VIII), when there is no court jurisdiction; Interstate placement from legal guardian to birth parent or relative, when there is no court jurisdiction; Interstate placement to a medical or psychiatric hospital; Interstate placement to an educational program (Job Corp, college, etc); Interstate placement of adjudicated delinquents unless placement is sought for residential treatment (see above); Divorce/custody assessments; International adoptions when the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has issued an IR-3 visa (adopted in the child’s country of origin); Placement of any child into/or out of Canada, Puerto Rico, Guam/American Samoa or any other foreign country; Children under court jurisdiction visiting a relative/parent for 30 days or less. Anything over 30 days is considered a placement and would be subject to ICPC. REGULATION I AND REGULATION VII The two most frequently cited regulations in the Compact are Regulations 1 and 7: ➢ Regulation No.1 -- Conversion of Intrastate Placement into Interstate Placement; Relocation of Family Units Regulation 1 applies when a family with a child who is under court jurisdiction is placed in their home, plans to move to another state. When the family moves, they may continue to receive the same benefits as in Missouri. The family should be advised they must meet the new state’s requirements for an approved home study. The ICPC referral is to be prepared within ten (10) calendar days, as directed in the CWM Section 4, Chapter 25. ➢ Regulation No. 7 – Priority Placement Regulation 7 referrals, commonly referred to as “Priority” referrals, were initiated to address the problem of frequent delays in completing home studies on a select group of individuals as identified in Article VIII of the Compact. Specific criterion listed below must be met and specifically addressed in the accompanying court order: The proposed placement recipient is a relative (as defined in RSMo 210.620 Article VIII) of the child(ren), and The child(ren) is under 2 years of age; or The child(ren) is in an emergency placement requiring the child to be moved within 30 days; or The child(ren) has spent a substantial amount of time in the home of the proposed placement recipient. A Regulation 7 referral cannot be court ordered if foster care licensing or an adoptive study is being requested, or if the child is already residing in the recipient’s home. FORMS The CS-ICPC forms listed below have been updated to CD-ICPC forms and are available on E-Forms. Staff should begin using the current versions of these forms as of this memo and destroy any outdated versions. ➢ Placement Request (CD-ICPC-100A) ( mandatory ) Form CD-ICPC-100A is a legal binding contract that is consistent in all Compact member states and territories. This form must be used by the sending agency to request approval to place a child in another state along with all relevant information, including the type of home study requested (relative, foster, or adoptive parent). If Missouri is the Sending Agency and is going to make a maintenance payment to the resource provider should the placement be approved, a foster home study should be requested regardless of the degree of relationship. If a home study is requested for an unlicensed relative, STARS for the Caregiver is not required. If a home study is requested for relative foster care, STARS for the Caregiver is required. Following the completion of a home study by the receiving state, this form is the official notification that the proposed placement can/cannot be made in conformity with the Interstate Compact. The CD-ICPC-100A must accompany all requests for out-of-state placements and it must be returned with an approval/denial for placement from the receiving state’s ICPC office BEFORE any Compact placement decision is made. ➢ Child Placement Status Report (CD-ICPC-100B) ( mandatory ) Form CD-ICPC-100B is consistent in all Compact member states and territories. Once the receiving state approves the placement this form is utilized by the sending state to notify the receiving state of the following: A child has moved to the approved placement and supervision is requested; or A change in physical placement in the receiving state has occurred; or The approved placement resource will not be utilized or the referral request is being withdrawn; or Termination of the ICPC agreement is necessary. RSMo 210.620, Article V states the sending agency shall retain jurisdiction until one of the following occurs: The child’s adoption is legally finalized; The child reaches the age of majority (18 years); The child becomes self-supporting; The child returns to Missouri; or The child is discharged from court jurisdiction with the concurrence of the appropriate authority in the receiving state. ➢ Transmittal Checklist (CD-ICPC-100D) ( mandatory ) Form CD-ICPC-100D, is used when a referral is made for the placement of a Missouri child into another state under the provisions of the ICPC. It is completed by the immediate supervisor of the Children’s Service Worker (CSW) who is making the referral to ensure that: An appropriate plan is being developed for each child; All necessary/required paperwork has been included and reviewed for completeness; The correct number of copies of all material has been included in the packet. Once the supervisor has reviewed the packet, checked the appropriate boxes and signed box #13, the packet – including this form -- is sent to the Circuit Manager (CM) or designee. The CM or designee then reviews for completeness and signs the CD-ICPC- 100D in box #14. Except in the case of Regulation 7, Priority referrals, all ICPC referrals must include this form signed by the CM or designee. Failure to include this form with the appropriate individuals’ signatures will result in the entire referral packet being returned to the sending county. ➢ Sending State Priority Home Study Request (CD-ICPC-101) ( mandatory ) Form CD-ICPC-101 is used to notify the receiving state that a Regulation 7, Priority placement, of a child is being requested. Form CD-ICPC-101 is completed with the rest of the referral packet within three (3) business days of receipt of a court order which indicates the court has determined that a priority placement situation exists. Child Welfare Manual, Section 4, Chapter 25 contains the criteria/timeframes to be used in determining whether a Priority referral is appropriate. ➢ Receiving State’s Priority Home Study (CD-ICPC-102) (optional) Form CD-ICPC-102 is optional and is used to complete a Priority Home Study in the time specified. This format is used only for those individuals who fall into the categories listed for a Priority referral (parents/step parent; grandparents/ step grandparents; aunts/ uncles; adult siblings) and who have been classified as such by the court of jurisdiction in the sending state. Staff may use the regular home study format or write a narrative in lieu of this form. For all other referrals refer to the Child Welfare Manual, Section 6, Chapter 3, Attachment A – Guide for Conducting Foster/ Kinship Family Assessments. ➢ Financial/Medical Plan (CD-ICPC-3) ( mandatory ) Form CD-ICPC-3 is a new form used to notify the receiving state of a child’s IV-E eligibility status and if a maintenance payment will be made on behalf of a child. If a child is not IV-E eligible and the resource placement will not receive a maintenance payment, this form lets the receiving state know that the resource family may need to apply for public assistance. This form also indicates how the child’s medical and financial needs will be met once placement occurs. The Financial/ Medical plan must accompany each initial ICPC referral packet. Any costs, other than regular maintenance payments, need to be approved through proper administrative channels. OBSOLETE FORMS The following forms are now obsolete: Certification of Eligibility for Title IV-E Foster Care or Adoption Assistance and Medical Assistance (CS-ICPC-1) and the Notice of Action/ Medicaid Eligibility (CS-ICPC-2) have been replaced by the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC) Financial/Medical Plan (CD-ICPC-3). The Protective Services Interstate Placement Form (SS 64) is no longer applicable. The CS- ICPC-1, CS-ICPC-2 and SS-64 forms should be destroyed. NEW LEGISLATION New legislation is currently underway throughout the country to amend the ICPC, but it must be adopted by thirty-five states in order to become effective. The new ICPC was recently approved by the Missouri General Assembly in Senate Bill 84, however, until it is ratified by 35 states, Missouri will continue to abide by the current provisions as indicated in RSMo 210.620.

The foster home licensing rules went into effect on January 30, 2007, and staff are to conduct all new licensing and renewals according to the revised licensing rules as of the date of this memorandum. Any currently licensed home must meet these requirements as their license is renewed. Staff should be addressing these changes with all licensed homes during their quarterly home visits to prepare resource providers for the changes they will need to make prior to their license being renewed. All contractors must also comply with these licensing criteria for homes they develop for their use or for those developed for the Division’s use under the Foster Care and Adoption Resource Services (FCARS) contract. FOSTER HOME LICENSING RULES The foster home licensing rules are located in the Child Welfare Manual, Section 6, Chapter 2, Attachment B. This section has been updated to reflect the revised licensing rules. The licensing rules are included in the Code of State Regulations and can be found on the secretary of state’s website ( www.sos.mo.gov ). The foster home licensing rules were previously included in Division 40 – Division of Family Services. This has now changed to Division 35 – Children’s Division. This memorandum will address the changes from the previous licensing rules except for those changes which relate to the foster home licensing emergency rule which went into effect in August, 2006. These changes were addressed in memorandum CD06-77 and will be addressed further in a forthcoming memorandum. The changes are addressed in the order in which they appear in the licensing rules. 13 CSR 35-60.010 Family Homes Offering Foster Care The changes to this section were the addition of the fingerprint background check information, the issuance of one license per household, suspension of a license, and utilization of the home. Fingerprint Background Checks – this change adds the requirement of fingerprint based background checks for all household members aged 17 and older as well as any child under age 17 that has been certified as an adult for the commission of a crime or has been convicted or pled guilty or nolo contendere to any crime. One License per Household – only one license will be issued per household. This means that a couple must be married in order for both persons to be included on the license. It also means that if more than one adult, no matter the relationship between the adults, lives in the household, only one may be licensed; for example a mother and adult daughter living in the same household, only one may be licensed as a foster parent. However, all adults living in the household who will have child care responsibilities must attend pre-service training but are not required to attend in-service training, although we would encourage them to do so. Suspension of License – this addition requires the Division to provide written notification to a licensee ten (10) days prior to their license being suspended and allows the provider to request a hearing and review. Thus, the Foster/Relative Home Action Report (CS-20) and the Notification of Resource Home Adverse Action letter (CS-20a) notifying the licensee of the action taken must be completed for all suspensions as it is for all denials and revocations. These forms can be found in the Children’s Division e-forms. Utilization of home – this is a new piece to this section and states that the granting of a license does not guarantee placement. It also states that all placement decisions will be made at the discretion of the Children’s Division and Juvenile Court in the best interest of the child based upon the totality of circumstances with parental preferences taken into consideration. This is to allow for CD and Juvenile Court staff to take into consideration the qualities and living situation of all potential placements and the preferences of the parents to make the best placement choice for the child. The foster family profile will be utilized in this process. Parental preferences alone should not prevent a potential placement resource from being selected. This is a decision that should be made with the Family Support Team. 13 CSR 35-60.020 Number of Children Changes to this section include the following: Language regarding dually licensed homes – the Division’s policy has been that no licensed foster home who is also licensed as a child care provider may have a foster child under the age of seven (7) in their home unless necessary to accommodate a sibling group. This change now places this policy into rule. Applicants and currently licensed homes must notify the Division of any contracts held for the care of children at the time of application or gained after licensure. 13 CSR 35-60.030 Minimum Qualifications of Foster Parent(s) There are significant changes to this section which include, the age of foster parents, citizenship status, competencies, a physician’s statement at license renewal, immunizations, training, home study information, and the foster family profile. Age of Foster Parents – this change adds language to the rule that allows for the licensure of a person under age 21 in the case of relative and kinship placements. Citizenship Status of Foster Parents – this has been added to the rules and requires that all persons seeking to be licensed by the Children’s Division must be a citizen of the United States or be able to verify lawful immigration status. All persons seeking licensure must provide a valid Social Security card or a Legal Immigrant Card (“green card”). All persons here legally have had a background check completed by the federal government prior to receiving their green card and their information is available in the FBI database. Therefore, a criminal background check may be completed on these individuals. Identix Identification Services, the contracted electronic fingerprint provider in Missouri, will accept a green card as identification for the purpose of completing background checks. Competencies – this addition to the Personal Qualifications for Foster Parents requires that foster parents be able to acquire and demonstrate performance based competence in each of the five competency areas (Protecting and nurturing; Meeting developmental needs; Supporting relationships between children and families; Connecting children to relationships intended to last a lifetime; and Working as a member of a professional team) and for re-evaluation of their abilities in these competencies at each license renewal. Physician’s Statement – this change adds the requirement of having the foster parent’s physician complete the Resource/Adoptive Family Medical/Health Report (CW-215) not only at the time of initial licensure but also at the time of renewal. Immunizations – requires that all family members be up to date on their immunizations. If anyone in the household is not up to date on immunizations, the family must provide a statement from their family physician that the health of foster children is not at risk. Training – requires the completion of a competency based training approved by the Division for pre-service and adds the requirement of in-service training hours for license renewal. Home study information – requires the collection of personal information for the purpose of completing a home study on the foster family. The information gathered will include, but is not limited to, Family size and household composition of the foster family; Ethnic and racial background of the foster family; Religious preferences and practices of the foster family; Lifestyles and practices, including sexual orientation, of the foster parents; Educational practices of the foster family; and Employment of the foster parents. This information will be collected during the initial assessment and must be updated at each license renewal assessment. Changes in some of these categories will require the home study to be updated within two weeks of the Division being notified of the change (changes to household composition, employment and address changes must be updated immediately per COA requirements). This requirement was previously addressed in memorandum CD06-49. Foster Family Profile – all of the information gathered for the home study will be condensed to comprise a foster family profile which will be utilized by the Family Support Team to assist in making placement decisions in the best interest of the child. A forthcoming memo will address this requirement in more depth. 13 CSR 35-60.040 Physical Standards for Foster Homes Changes to this section include: The cost of testing for a private water supply is to be the responsibility of the applicant or licensee. If the water supply is found to be unsafe for human consumption, an alternative source of drinking water is to be made available; The addition of swimming pools to the list of hazards which may require fencing; Clarification of age six and two (children age six (6) and older of the opposite sex are not to sleep in the same room and children age two (2) and older shall not sleep in the same room as foster parents); The foster home must have an operable phone or CD approved form of emergency contact; Requires smoke detectors in the home to be operable with batteries installed; Increases the required capacity of fire extinguishers in foster homes from 2 ½ to 5 pounds; and Requires carbon monoxide detectors in all households with gas appliances. This section also has new Weapons Requirements for foster homes which include: Any and all firearms and ammunition shall be stored so as to be inaccessible to children. Foster parents shall store ammunition separately from any weapons. Firearms and ammunition shall be stored in locked areas or cabinets with keys secured so as to be inaccessible to children. No firearms shall be kept in any vehicle transporting foster children (unless weapons are inaccessible to the foster child – i.e., in a locked glove box or other locked container or in the trunk of the vehicle) or on any person providing care or supervision to foster children. (An exception will be made for any person transporting a foster child who must carry a weapon as part of their job responsibilities – i.e., law enforcement officers.) No firearms possessed in violation of a state or federal law or a local government ordinance shall be present at any time in the home, on any household member, or in any vehicle in which the children are riding. Weapons storage shall be made available for external viewing by Children’s Division staff in order to assure weapons are inaccessible to children. 13 CSR 35-60.050 Care of Children The changes to this section include the requirement of the foster parents to: Participate in the Family Support Team (FST) meetings via physical attendance or via written or oral input; Notify the division within two weeks of any pertinent changes in their family situation (changes in household composition, marital status, employment, address, phone number, arrests, convictions, guilty pleas, etc.); Maintain medical and school files on foster children; “Act as the parent” on behalf of a foster child in the development of an IEP; Comply with all FST recommendations and court orders regarding visitation plans; and Support the foster child’s cultural identity and individuality in foster care. The Education and Training piece of this section has the most significant changes as it outlines that the educational and vocational plan for the foster child shall be determined by the FST, including at a minimum the legal custodian or representative of the licensed child placing agency, the parent(s), foster parent(s), juvenile officer, and child of appropriate age, twelve and above. The changes to this section also include the removal of the requirement for foster parents to provide allowances for foster children. 13 CSR 35-60.060 Records and Reports The changes to this section include requirements for the Division and its staff. These requirements include: Develop a record on each foster child to be given to the foster parent(s) at the time of placement; Provide additional information on the child to the foster parent(s) as it becomes available to the Division and outlines the content to be included in the record; Provide an after hours contact number for the case manager; and Provide all medical and dental information on the foster child including psychosocial and mental health history. The contents of the record are listed in the Child Welfare Manual Section 6 Chapter 3 Attachment B. RESOURCE HOME AND SAFETY CHECKLIST The Division has a responsibility to assure the safety of the children in division care and to do so, all homes providing care to our children will now have a Resource Home and Safety Checklist (CS-45) completed prior to licensure or the placement of a child. The CS-45 was previously the Kinship Home and Safety Checklist. This form has been adapted so it may be utilized for all of our resource homes and is attached along with instructions. Changes have also been made to the CS-42 Application for Foster/Adopt Home Assessment which include Reorganization of the form, Removal of the statement regarding the release of the information contained in the form, Changes the law violation section to Legal History, and Addition of a Child Abuse and Neglect History, NECESSARY ACTION Review this memorandum with all Children’s Division staff.

"DOCUMENTATION OF EMAIL CORRESPONDENCE, SET UP AND MAINTENANCE OF PROVIDER RECORDS, AND ROLE OF WORKER IN RESOURCE PROVIDER LICENSING AND LICENSE MAINTENANCE",Missouri,Memo,"2007, 2006","Administrative process, Contact and directory information, Social worker licensing/qualifications","REGIONAL EXECUTIVE STAFF, CIRCUIT MANAGERS AND  CHILDREN’S DIVISION STAFF","PAULA NEESE, INTERIM DIRECTOR","REFERENCE: CHILDREN’S DIVISION DISCUSSION: The purpose of this memorandum is to introduce changes in policy related to the documentation of email correspondence in all case types, the set up and maintenance of provider records, and the role of the worker in resource provider licensing and license maintenance. These changes are contained in the Child Welfare Manual, Section 5, Chapter 1; and Section 6, Chapter 3, Attachment M. Attachment M is a new addition to the manual. DOCUMENTATION OF EMAIL CORRESPONDENCE Email has become a typical form of communication for our staff. We utilize this form of communication to relay information regarding cases to other Division staff, Juvenile Court personnel, placement providers, and attorneys. While we are using this form of communication more often, it still tends to be less formal in nature. The informality associated with this form of communication can create problems when staff are trying to adequately document case activity. Therefore, guidelines for the recording and documentation of email correspondence is being added to the Child Welfare Manual, Section 5, Chapter 1. Email correspondence pertaining to a case must be included in recording and documentation. The email message shall be printed and included in the correspondence section of the case file. Staff should also note in the narrative section that contact was made with an individual through email in the narrative section but the content of the message does not need to be included. Since email correspondence shall be included in the case file, staff should give the same consideration to the content as they would for letters and other forms of correspondence. Only information pertaining to the case should be included in the message and discussion of topics unrelated to the case should not be contained within the message. Staff are reminded that this form of correspondence is open to release when a request is made for a file. Since email may be released with the rest of the file, it is important that staff are careful to only include necessary and pertinent information. Personal information and commentary regarding case members or others involved in the case is not appropriate for this type of correspondence and should be left out. It is also important for best practice that only one case be discussed in each email. This means when consulting with a supervisor, Juvenile Officer or attorney regarding multiple cases, multiple emails should be sent. If email is received from another party discussing numerous cases, a copy of the correspondence should be placed in each case file with the names and information regarding the other cases redacted from the copy. Notation should be made in the narrative as to why there is information redacted from the correspondence. SET UP AND MAINTENANCE OF PROVIDER RECORDS Guidelines have now been established for the set up and maintenance of provider records. These guidelines are contained in Section 5, Chapter 1, of the Child Welfare Manual. Case recording for resource provider records should be completed quarterly and signed by the Children’s Services Worker responsible for licensing of the family. Documentation should include, at a minimum, the dates of quarterly home visits and who was seen at the visit, current number and type of placements, changes in household composition, licensing concerns, and progress on the Professional Family Development Plan. Quarterly home visits must be conducted by the licensing worker or another approved staff member and should not be conducted by the Children’s Services Workers for the foster children in the household. Quarterly documentation should also address any identified safety issues. The case narrative and documentation should be reviewed and signed quarterly by the supervisor for the worker responsible for licensing the home. ROLE OF THE WORKER The role of the Children’s Services Worker responsible for licensing resource providers is to coordinate the licensing and maintenance of all foster, relative and kinship care homes. This coordination includes recruitment, training, and support of foster, relative and kinship care providers. It also includes addressing any concerns (i.e. licensing violations or failing to meet the competencies) with the providers and assuring the home continues to meet licensing standards. A list of job duties related to resource provider licensing are contained in Section 6, Chapter 3, Attachment M, of the Child Welfare Manual. Changes have also been made to Section 6 Chapter 3.1 in order to comply with Council on Accreditation standard S21.10.05 . The changes made to this section were addressed in memorandum CD06-49 , and require the assessment (home study) to be updated within two weeks when significant changes within the foster, relative or kinship home are brought to staff’s attention.

This memo updates information introduced in memo CD05-80 . The completion of home studies and receipt of all necessary materials for licensure can often take longer than 30 days. This could result in providers not receiving payments for children placed in their homes pending the licensure process. In order to provide our staff and families time to obtain all necessary paperwork and to complete a thorough home study, the Division will now allow maintenance payments to unlicensed relative and kinship care providers for 90 days. Edits have been made to the payment system to allow for this extension. Payments will not be generated after 90 days so it is important to ensure that the family is licensed within 90 days.

CLOSING LICENSE OF RESOURCE HOMES WITHOUT A PLACEMENT FOR THE LAST 12 MONTHS OR LONGER,Missouri,Memo,"2007, 2006","Administrative process, Contact and directory information, Forms - Other, Foster parent licensing, Placement","REGIONAL EXECUTIVE STAFF, CIRCUIT MANAGERS AND  CHILDREN’S DIVISION STAFF","PAULA NEESE, INTERIM DIRECTOR","REFERENCE: CHILDREN’S DIVISION DISCUSSION: The purpose of this memorandum is to introduce changes in policy related to closing of resource homes that have not had a placement for the last 12 months or longer. These changes are located in the Child Welfare Manual Section 6 Chapter 3. Foster, relative and kinship homes are licensed to provide care to the children in the Division’s custody. Homes that are licensed but not accepting placements inflate the numbers of available homes and mask the issue of lack of available placements for children in the Division’s custody. The Division takes the placement of children very seriously and as such want to have licensed only those homes that are actively accepting and providing for alternative care placements. Therefore, the Division is establishing a protocol and guidelines for the closing of licenses for those homes that have not had a placement for the last 12 months or longer. At the time of license renewal, the Children’s Services Worker responsible for licensing should identify those homes which have not had a placement in the last 12 months or longer. Once a home is identified, the worker should contact the family to arrange a face to face meeting. At this meeting, the worker should discuss the reason why the family has not had a placement during the past year or longer. For foster care providers, the worker should discuss the reason why the foster parent(s) has not had a placement during this time frame as well as discussing the types of children needing foster care placement. The goal should be to work with the family so they are ready to take foster care placements. A plan can be made to address the concerns of the foster parent(s) and/or the Division. The foster parent(s) may attend additional training or may be utilized for respite care to address placement concerns. The Professional Family Development Plan should be utilized for this process. Information on the Professional Family Development Plan is located in the Child Welfare Manual Section 6 Chapter 2 Attachment C . The worker should begin the process for closing the license only after working with the foster parent(s) to reach an agreement on placing children in the home and discussion with the worker’s supervisor. The worker should complete the form CS-20 Foster/Relative Home Action Report. These will be considered a voluntary relinquishment of the license, unless licensing violations are present and impact the decision to close the license, and staff should mark “other” in the reason for the license relinquishment. Staff should explain that the foster home has not had placement for the last 12 months or longer and that an agreement could not be reached for the placement of children in the home. If the foster family does not agree with closing the license, it should be suspended until such time as the family will accept children or license closing or revocation can be completed. Once the CS-20 is completed and approved, staff should update the SS-60 to show the license has been closed. The close reason used should be “04 – Vendor Resource Discontinued Service”. An exception can be made for Teaching Foster Parents who are not currently accepting placements since the contract for Teaching Foster Parents requires them to have a current license. For relative and kinship care providers, the worker should determine if the providers may be utilized for the identified child(ren) in the future. The license may be kept open if there is a possibility that the relative/kin child(ren) may return to the home. If the worker and supervisor feel the family is appropriate for consideration, they may also discuss with the provider the needs of the circuit for alternative care providers to determine if the provider is interested in becoming a licensed foster home. The license should be closed if neither of these criteria is met. The closing procedure is the same as noted above. NECESSARY ACTION: Review this memorandum with all Children’s Division staff. Review revised Child Welfare Manual chapters as indicated below. Any questions regarding this e-mail should be sent through normal supervisory channels.

New codes have been added to better identify and track all children who are court ordered in a relative or non-relative kinship placement or in foster home placements. CTO CONVERSION PROCESS All current CTO placements with a relative (C) or non-relative (D) subtype must be converted to one of the new Relative (RH) or Kinship (KH) codes by January, 31, 2006. Effective immediately staff will no longer be able to enter any new placement subtypes of CTO-C or D on the SS-61. The current CTO-C or D subtypes will continue to appear on the SS-61 turnaround until all conversions have been completed. A system generated listing of children in those placements will be sent to Regional Directors and Quality Assurance (QA) Specialists each month until all conversions have been completed. The QA Specialists have been trained on the CTO conversion process and will support Circuits in training and assisting staff with the conversions. NEW CODES Placement Codes on SS-61 (Field 47): RHU- an unlicensed Relative Home KHU- an unlicensed Non-Relative Kinship Home KHO- a licensed Non-Relative Kinship Home KHB- a licensed Behavioral Non-Relative Kinship Home KHM- a licensed Medical Non-Relative Kinship Home Due to the volume of children currently in CTO-C or D placements it is anticipated there will not be a high number of new KHO, KHB or KHM placements. Many of the conversions may be either RHU or KHU placement types. The conversions will then more accurately reflect an increase of children placed in relative or kinship homes as desired by our Program Improvement Plan (PIP). For the purpose of differentiating relative versus non-relative placements: a Relative (RH) placement signifies the child and placement provider are related by blood, marriage or adoption. A Kinship (KH) placement signifies there is no blood, marriage or adoption relationship but a close relationship exists between the child and kinship provider. Staff shall also check the appropriateness of the current placement type for ALL children in ACTS. Those children living with a relative but are currently tracked as FHO must be changed to accurately reflect a relative placement type. If children are placed with a relative, the only appropriate placement types are: RHO, RHB, RHM, RHU or ADR. NEW LICENSURE CODES ON SS-60 (FIELD 24a) Per CD policy, Section 6 Chapter 3, an unlicensed placement provider can receive a maintenance payment of state-only funds for 30 days if they are pursuing licensure. Those providers already in the system as CTO-C or D must decide whether or not they want to be licensed, complete training and enter into a contractual agreement with the CD. If the provider does not want to be licensed, staff will still need to complete the SS-60 to obtain a vendor number. Staff will need to check vendor screens, VNME and VNMA, in PROD to verify the placement provider does not already possess a vendor number. If the vendor already has an assigned vendor number, that Departmental Vendor Number (DVN) should be used to update the SS-60. If there is no vendor number, an SS-60 will need to be completed in order for the placement provider to be assigned a DVN. Field 24a on the SS-60 is a new field to document the vendor’s Licensing Status of: 1=the vendor meets licensing and training requirements 2=the vendor is pursuing licensure 3=the vendor is not pursuing licensure or maintenance Code ‘1’ will correspond to placement types: KHO, KHB, KHM, RHO, RHB, and RHM. If the vendor’s license has expired and the vendor chooses to meet licensing requirements, they must apply for a new license before this field can be updated. Code ‘2’ will correspond to placement types: RHU and KHU ONLY. If a vendor is pursuing licensure, the vendor can be updated to reflect when licensure has been completed to Code ‘1’. If it is determined the vendor does not meet licensure requirements or later chooses not to receive maintenance, the vendor should be updated to Code ‘3’. Code ‘3’ will correspond to placement types: RHU and KHU ONLY. Vendors classified as a Code ‘3’ do not meet licensure requirements or opt not to be licensed. These vendors are not eligible for maintenance. The licensing status entered in Field 24a on the SS-60 determines the maintenance code in Field 56 on the SS-61. See the chart below for data entry information. Placement Type LICENSURE CODES 1, 2, 3 FIELD 24a ON SS-60 MAINTENANCE CODES ON SS-61 KHU/RHU 2 = Pursuing licensure 3 = Not pursuing licensure IF Kinship/Relative Status = 2: Enter code of ‘1’ in field 56 on SS-61. This will automatically generate payment for 30 days and only 30 days. DO NOT PAY PROVIDER PAST 30 DAYS, unless licensure is completed and system updated. IF Kinship/Relative Status = 3: Enter code of ‘3’ in field 56 on SS-61 when the provider does not want to pursue licensure or may not be eligible for licensure. Payment will not generate as the provider is not eligible to receive payments. KHO/RHO 1 = Vendor meets licensure, contract and training requirements Update ZVLI (field 24a) from status ‘2’ to status ‘1’ When licensure is completed on kinship/relative providers within 30 days and ZVLI (field 24a) is updated within 30 days to a ‘1’, ZCC3 (field 56) will be correct. If licensure is not completed within 30 days, update ZVLI (field 24a) to a ‘1’ and update ZCC3 (field 56) on the SS-61 from ‘3’ to ‘1’ KHB/RHB 1 = Vendor meets licensure, contract and training requirements Update ZVLI (field 24a) from status ’2’ to status ‘1' Update ZCC3 (field 56) on the SS-61 from ‘1’ to ‘4’ (above standard rate). Enter the monthly rate for behavioral care. KHM/RHM 1 = Vendor meets licensure, contract and training requirements Update ZVLI (field 24a) from status ‘2’ to status ‘1’ Update ZCC3 (field 56) on the SS-61 from ‘1’ to ‘4’ (above standard rate). Enter the monthly rate for medical care SS-60 and SS-61 CHANGES The SS-60 and SS-61 instructions, code sheets and forms have been changed to reflect the new codes. Hyperlinks are included for staff to link to updates. SS-60 Instructions: KH has been added to the following fields which must be completed for this vendor type: Field 1, Field 13, Field 18, Sections C (includes new Field 24a information), D, E, F and Attachments A-1, A-2, and A-3. SS-60 Code Sheet: KH has been added to Field 3. Field 24a is for Licensing Status. SS-60 Form: Reflects KH added to Sections C, D, E, and F. SS-61 Instructions: Updates are reflected in Section C-Grid, Special Instructions Grid, Field 47, Field 47a, 47c, 48 & Notes. The demographics in Fields 48a-48h are no longer necessary and will be removed from the entry form, but continue on the turnaround until all conversions have been completed. SS-61 Code Sheet: Updates occur in Fields 47 and 47a. SS-61 Form: The entire row for CTO-1 and CTO-2 Provider information has been removed. MANUAL UPDATES: The following changes have been made to the CW manual. Section 2 Chapter 7.1 and 7.5.4.3—reflects the addition of Licensed Foster Parents/Relatives/Kinship, and the heading changed from Division Foster Parent to Licensed/Unlicensed Placement Provider in 7.5.4.3. Section 4 Chapter 4.4.1—redefines the definition of kinship care as no blood, marriage or adoption relationship, but a close relationship exists between the child and kinship provider. Section 4 Chapter 4 Attachment B, page 1—“Placement shall be in a licensed home which has a contract with the Children’s Division to provide foster care, relative/kinship care, foster/adoptive care, residential treatment and family group home services.” Section 4 Chapter 5 Attachment A—the grid has been updated. Section 4 Chapter 12.3—Agency Arranged Kinship Care section: the information has been updated on steps to take once a relative or kinship provider has been identified, as well as the process for completing the SS-60/SS-61 for licensing and maintenance. Section 6 Chapter 3.1, page 3 in Foster/Kinship Family Assessment section: added the name of the SS-60 form. ACCESS: Staff can now access the updated versions of the instructions, code sheets and forms for the SS-60 and SS-61 in E FORMS via the Employee Intranet Home page in Word. Staff should delete the outdated documents in One Form on their personal computers.

USE OF ELECTRONIC SCANNING SERVICE FOR CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS,Missouri,Memo,"2007, 2006, 2005","Administrative process, Contact and directory information, Foster parent licensing","REGIONAL EXECUTIVE STAFF, CIRCUIT MANAGERS, AND CHILDREN’S DIVISION STAFF","PAULA NEESE, INTERIM DIRECTOR","We have been fingerprinting all prospective foster parents, relative care providers and adult household members since January 28, 2004, as required by RSMo 210.487. We previously submitted fingerprint cards to the Missouri State Highway Patrol (MSHP) for processing. However, MSHP awarded a contract to Identix Identification Services (IIS) to provide electronic fingerprint scanning services in Missouri. This service is known as Missouri Applicant Processing Services or MOAPS . The Children’s Division began utilizing this service in July, 2005. This service is also utilized by in home child care providers who are monitored through the Office of Early Childhood. Information on the use of the electronic scan service by in home child care providers can be found by referencing Memo CD05-49 , dated 08/17/05. This memorandum is to outline the changes made in policy regarding: The submission of fingerprints; Review the process for using MOAPS; Review the letters to be provided to applicants for scheduling purposes; and Establish a process for conducting group scan sessions. The Child Welfare Manual has been updated to include the new electronic scan process. These changes were made to Section 6 Chapter 3 Attachments A, D, and H. The electronic scan process should be the only process utilized; however, there may be specific situations in which the previous card and ink method may be used. This should be done in rare cases only, such as homebound adults living in a foster, relative or kinship home. Staff should be aware that results on card and ink prints may take as long as 3 months to be returned. We are currently averaging 10 weeks for card and ink results. The rejection rate is also much higher using this method. Therefore, staff should provide sufficient time for these results to be returned so there will not be a delay in issuing or renewing a license. No provider should be issued a license prior to the criminal background check results being received. Applicants may schedule their appointments either by phone or through the Identix website. The process for registration is as follows: Contact MOAPS to schedule the appointment. To schedule by phone, call 1-866-522-7067. To schedule via the Internet, go to www.identix.com/iis . The applicant will need to identify the reason they are being printed and that is to provide foster care for the Children's Division. Respite providers and biological parents will need to state that they are being printed at the request of the Children’s Division. MOAPS staff will request additional identifying information. This information includes: Full name _______________ Date of Birth _______________ Social Security Number _______________ ORI number M0920360Z OCA code _______________ (The OCA field must be provided to the applicant by the local office prior to the applicant contacting MOAPS. The OCA codes were previously provided to all counties.) Once MOAPS has collected the information, a date and time for the appointment will be set. Applicants may view available sites on the IIS website. This information may be located by going to www.identix.com/iis and clicking on Missouri . This will take you to the Missouri information page. Under the Current Project Status heading, there is a link within the text titled Missouri location web page . This will show all current locations and the number of days available for scanning. The process information listed above should be provided to all applicants by utilizing one of the letters previously provided to counties. There are letters for alternative care providers, biological parents, respite care providers and private agencies. The letters for alternative care providers, biological parents and respite care providers are attached. These letters include the ORI and OCA information which are the components necessary for adequate billing process. It is important to be sure that the appropriate OCA code is utilized so our alternative care providers will not be charged for their prints. There are separate letters for biological parents and respite providers as we do not cover the cost of those prints. The cost to them for utilizing MOAPS is $50.95, which includes the fees of $24 for FBI, $14 for MSHP, and $12.95 processing fee. Identix is able to determine whether to bill the Division or charge the applicant the fees based upon the OCA code provided by Children’s Division staff. The Division may pay for criminal background checks for relative studies being done through ICPC if the family is completing the licensure process. Relatives not completing the licensure process will be responsible for payment for the background screening. The Division will not pay for the background checks on any individuals residing with the biological parent(s). Specific questions regarding the ICPC process should be directed to the ICPC unit in Central Office. Identix offers on-site scanning for groups of 30 or more. Children’s Division staff may arrange this service by contacting Identix Identification Services at 573-592-7169 or 941-730-4766. The current IIS staff member handling these requests is Christine Devore. Staff should give 2-3 weeks notice when arranging an on-site session. Staff will need to decide whether applicants will complete forms for submission to Identix or enroll online for the on-site scanning. IIS will work with staff to make these arrangements and to schedule the sessions. If a county is experiencing delays in receiving background results, they may contact Martha Witt in the Background Screening and Investigation Unit at 573-751-3448 or Martha.S.Witt@dss.mo.gov or Stefanie Wickers in the Quality Improvement and Field Support Unit.

INDEPENDENT LIVING ARRANGEMENTS,Missouri,Memo,"2024, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020","Administrative process, Placement",CHILDREN’S DIVISION AND CONTRACTED STAFF,"REGINALD E. MCELHANNON, INTERIM DIRECTOR","DISCUSSION: The purpose of this memorandum is to clarify qualifications of an Independent Living Arrangement (ILA) as a placement type, new requirements, and introduce a new review process. The changes are effective with this memo. Missouri reports data annually on youth in ILA placements and this placement type must meet the requirements as outlined in the Child Welfare Policy Manual to avoid audit findings that result in a Program Improvement Plan. Youth in Independent Living Arrangements, while often viewed as doing well and being capable of living “independently”, need as much if not more support than youth in other placement types as there is not a resource parent in the young person’s life and they often have limited personal connections. Effective with this memo, youth in an ILA placement must have two contacts per month, at least one in person in their living environment. As ILA is the only placement type in which there is not a resource provider involved, this level of contact is a necessary next step to help improve outcomes and successful transition of youth exiting state custody. Youth Criteria: Youth in an ILA should have a goal of Another Planned Permanent Living Arrangement (APPLA) and must be receiving Chafee Services prior to the placement being made. Although licensure is not involved, an ILA is a planned and approved living arrangement that must meet certain criteria to ensure the safety and wellbeing of the youth. Youth in an ILA should be able to demonstrate competency in life skills, manage his/her own finances, demonstrate responsible conduct, and are attending school and or working. An FST or Team Decision Making Placement Stability meeting shall occur prior to a youth moving into an ILA. Youth in an ILA must be at least 18 years old; in Missouri, youth under the age of 18 are not allowed to enter into a lease agreement, which is vital to provide housing stability. Youth who are 17 may be considered for ILA if they have 2 obtained their high school diploma or HiSet. Youth who are still attending high school are typically not able to focus on the demands of sustaining an ILA residence thus they should be referred for the Transitional Living Program instead. Household Composition: Youth in an ILA are allowed to have roommates, however, ILA is not to be used as a substitute for relative licensure to provide a form of maintenance for the family, including the biological parent whose rights have been terminated. Placement with a safe supportive adult is always ideal over an Independent Living Arrangement whenever possible. If placement with an adult caregiver is the plan for the youth, another placement code should be used instead of ILA. ILA shall not to be used in situations where the youth is living with a parent. Foster Care is a form of substitute care for children whose safety or well-being requires they be removed from the home of their parent(s). If the parent of the foster youth resides in the home, the foster youth is no longer “removed from the control of his parents” per RSM0 211.011 nor is the youth “unattended by parent” per RSMo 210.481(4). ILA shall not be used as a placement with friends or family members who are unable to meet licensure requirements. If an adult exercises authority over the youth or has in the past, or the youth is paying “rent” to a family member or former foster parent while residing in the same residence, this is not an appropriate ILA placement. A youth in an ILA shall not be providing supervision or authority over any other youth residing in the home. Consequently siblings of youth in an ILA may not be “placed” with the youth as an ILA placement. If a sibling meets all of the ILA requirements, the siblings may however reside together as housemates. For example, a 15 year old and an 18 year old may not reside together in ILA placements as a 15 year old does not meet the age requirements. However, an 18 year old and a 19 year old sibling may reside together as they both meet the age requirements for ILA. Youth working on their own successful transition from foster care should not be put in a position of having parental authority over a sibling, and youth under the age of the ILA requirements are in need of parental authority. Service and Supervision Provisions: If a youth resides in a community program that provides living arrangements such as Job Corp, this is an ILA placement and the youth shall receive maintenance directly to them as they are living independently. The youth may visit a resource family on the weekend however the majority of the time the youth is residing in a program and thus it is not a foster care placement. Youth in an ILA shall not “rent” a room or apartment from a foster parent or parent. ILA is meant to be a community setting for independence. Renting from a parent or foster parent can result in complications as these persons have had authority over the youth in the past and leave the youth in a vulnerable position, such as homelessness, should the relationship change. If a youth is case managed by an agency outside of Children’s Division or Foster Care Case Management, such as the Department of Mental Health or a group home program that is not licensed but in which staff reside, this is not an ILA. Youth in an ILA should be able to manage their own physical and mental health needs on a daily basis, are able to come and go on their own, and have entered into a lease agreement to reside in the dwelling. Youth who qualify for an ILA should have a plan to exit to independence, not to the care of another agency. There are some community agencies providing services similar to transitional living program services via an apartment or a group home setting that are not licensed and contracted with Children’s Division to provide this service. These programs are not approved to provide services for youth in foster care so youth should not be placed with them and coded as an ILA. Staff in these facilities are not monitored by Children’s Division. If a youth is in need of a Transitional Living Program , a referral shall be made with an agency who is contracted with Children’s Division to provide this service. Steps To Be Taken: New Tools: Two new tools have been developed to be used in conjunction with the CS-TLP1 for placement in an ILA: Independent Living Arrangement Checklist, CD-282 and the SelfDeveloped Case Plan for Independent Living Arrangement, CD-283. The ILA Checklist, CD-282 has been developed for use with all youth currently residing in or being considered for an ILA placement. For any youth with a placement code of ILA, the Independent Living Arrangement Checklist, CD-282 and the CS-TLP-1 shall be completed within the next 30 days and the process outlined below followed to ensure youth currently coded as ILA are appropriately placed and safe. The Independent Living Arrangement Checklist, CD-282 and the CS-TLP-1 shall be completed each time the youth moves to a new ILA to ensure the living environment is safe and meets ILA requirements. The checklist should be reviewed quarterly by the case manager and the supervisor during case consultation. If a youth is determined to not meet the criteria for an ILA placement, the coding shall not be used. The Self-Developed Case Plan for Independent Living Arrangement, CD-283 is used to assist with preparation and budgeting for an initial ILA placement. Prior to Placement: Moving forward, for any new placements in which ILA is being considered, PRIOR to placement being made, the Children’s Service Worker shall send the completed ILA 4 Checklist, CD-282 and the Self-Developed Case Plan for Independent Living Arrangement, CD-283 to the Circuit Manager (CM)/Program Manager (PM) for review. After reviewing, the CM/PM will indicate whether the placement constitutes an ILA per the criteria in the Child Welfare Policy Manual. A decision as to whether the placement meets ILA criteria should be determined within 30 days after the checklist is initially received. If the placement does not meet the criteria for an ILA, and the family support team or court wishes to pursue the living arrangement, a different placement code will need to be used (i.e. RHU, CTO, etc.). A copy of the Independent Living Arrangement (ILA) Checklist, CD-282, the CS-TLP-1 , and the Self-Developed Case Plan for Independent Living Arrangement, CD-283 shall be placed in the youth’s file in the Older Youth Program section and a copy shall be provided to the Regional Older Youth Transition Specialists upon completion.

LICENSURE OF FOSTER/ADOPTIVE APPLICANTS AND COMMUNICABLE DISEASE SECTION 6.3 ATTACHMENT B FOSTER FAMILY HOME LICENSING RULES,Missouri,Memo,"2007, 2006, 2005","Definitions, Expectations for care, Foster parent licensing","AREA EXECUTIVE STAFF, CIRCUIT MANAGERS AND CHILDREN’S DIVISION STAFF","FREDERIC M. SIMMENS, DIRECTOR","The purpose of this memorandum is to clarify the Children’s Division’s communicable disease policy. As per the Department of Health and Senior Services, a communicable disease is defined as a disease that can be transmitted from one person to another. These diseases can range from mild to serious. This definition is dependant upon a physician’s examination and diagnosis. The CSR 40.60.020 foster/adopt home license rules state the following: Health of Foster Family: At the time of application for an initial license, foster parents shall authorize their physician to submit a statement on a prescribed form, regarding his opinion of the mental health of each foster family member and certifying that a physical examination was completed within the past year and that the foster family members are free from communicable disease. A tuberculosis test and/or chest x-ray shall be completed, if recommended by the physician. The physician’s statement shall indicate whether the applicant has a communicable disease and shall further state whether the disease will present a medical risk to children and families and if the disease is easily transferred from one person to another. If the physician’s statement reveals the above we will be unable to license the individual as a foster/adopt home. If a currently licensed foster/adopt parent is occupationally exposed to blood or other potentially infectious material they would need to be evaluated for exposure to communicable diseases. A foster or relative parent who accepts a child who has a communicable disease shall be required to be trained in the proper medical handling procedures for the child in their care to ensure continued safety of the child and foster/adopt family. There may be individual situations when a relative or kinship provider who is infected with a communicable disease can be licensed as a child specific placement with parental consent. NECESSARY ACTION: Review this memorandum with all Children’s Division Staff. Review Section 6.3. Attachment B, Foster Family Home Licensing Rules in the Child Welfare Manual. Implement policy immediately upon receipt of this policy. All comments and recommendations regarding this subject should be cleared through normal supervisory channels.

FINGERPRINTING PROCESS,Missouri,Memo,"2007, 2006, 2005, 2004",Administrative process,"REGIONAL EXECUTIVE STAFF, CIRCUIT MANAGERS AND  CHILDREN’S DIVISION STAFF","FREDERIC M. SIMMENS, DIRECTOR","REFERENCE: CHILDREN’S DIVISION DISCUSSION: We have been made aware that recently foster, relative and kinship providers have been sent directly to the Highway Patrol to have fingerprints completed rather than sending the fingerprint cards through the Background Screening and Investigation Unit (BSIU). All foster, relative and kinship providers, both initially and at renewal, should have fingerprints taken by the local office or contracted provider following the process outlined in Memorandum CD04-05. These should then be submitted to BSIU for completion by the Missouri State Highway Patrol (MSHP) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). No foster, relative or kinship provider should be sent to the Highway Patrol for fingerprinting except in extreme emergencies and with Regional Director approval. The following is the procedure when sending foster, relative and kinship providers to the Highway Patrol. Regional Director gives approval for foster, relative or kinship provider to go to MSHP The licensing worker contacts BSIU at 573-751-3448 to make arrangements for foster, relative or kinship provider to go to MSHP. The licensing worker will need to provide the following information at the time arrangements are made: Date of birth on each person to be fingerprinted Social Security number on each person to be fingerprinted Date each person plans to be at MSHP for fingerprinting Copy of Regional Director’s Approval The foster, relative or kinship provider will need to bring the rejected fingerprint card with them if they are being sent to MSHP due to the return of the cards (due to bad prints, unreadable prints, etc). Foster, relative and kinship providers should not be sent to MSHP except in extreme emergencies and without prior arrangements being made. This procedure was developed due to many concerns that arise when prospective providers are sent without prior notification and approval. First, the families will be charged to have their fingerprint checks completed. The cost is $14 for the MSHP screening and $24 for FBI screening and this cost can not be reimbursed by the Division. Secondly, staff at MSHP must handle any walk-in requests immediately and this takes them away from fingerprint cards that were sent in for processing and creates further delays for other prospective homes. It also creates issues for chain of evidence since the results will be given directly to the prospective providers and will not be processed through BSIU. This also means that our tracking and statistics will not be accurate which can affect funding and create other issues with the legislature and our consumers. By following all procedures for completing fingerprint background screens, we can limit the problems experienced by staff and families. It is the goal of the Division and the Missouri State Highway Patrol to streamline this process and decrease the turnaround time for results. However, this can not be done without the cooperation of all staff, contracted providers and families. Additional fingerprinting cards can be ordered through the warehouse. They are form #FD-258. Additional information regarding ordering fingerprinting cards can be obtained by reviewing Memorandum CD04-05. NECESSARY ACTION: Review this memorandum with all Children’s Division staff. Review Memorandum CD04-05. The following sections have been changed in the Child Welfare Manual Intranet site: Section 6, Chapter 3, Attachment A, Guide for Conducting Foster/Kinship Family Assessments Section 6, Chapter 3, Attachment D, Guide for Conducting Renewal Assessment All comments and questions regarding this memorandum should be cleared through normal supervisory channels.

SIMMENS, DIRECTOR","REFERENCE: CHILDREN’S DIVISION DISCUSSION: The purpose of this memo is to clarify procedures for completing background investigations on applicants when an ICPC referral is received requesting a home assessment. The Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC) ensures protections and services to children who are placed across state lines for the purpose of relative/kinship care, foster care or adoption. ICPC establishes procedures for ensuring safe and suitable placements. Through ICPC, legal and financial responsibilities for those placements are also ensured. Missouri’s Children’s Division is responsible for assuring the highest degree of safety possible for children entering the state. According to the Child Welfare Manual, Section 6.3.A, the following steps are to be taken when completing a background investigation in a home assessment for the purpose of licensure. The same steps are to be taken in completion of any ICPC assessment. STEPS TO BE FOLLOWED FOR LICENSURE: The following steps shall be completed for every applicant and adult household member (age 18 and older). Supporting documentation of each step is to be filed in the licensing record . The Child Abuse/Neglect background screening will continue to be done by the local Children’s Division (CD). Each household member 18 years of age and older must register with the Family Care Safety Registry (FCSR). The registry is maintained by the Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS). The following background screening information is available from FCSR: Missouri criminal history information made available from the Missouri State Highway Patrol; Sex Offender Registry information made available from the Department of Social Services; The employee disqualification list made available from the Department of Health and Senior Services; Child-care facility licensing records made available by the Department of Social Services; and Residential living facility and nursing home licensing records made available from the Department of Health and Senior Services. Give the applicant a “Worker Registration Form” to register each adult in the household with the FCSR. Copies of the form can be ordered from the warehouse or downloaded at http://www.dhss.state.mo.us/FCSR . Instruct the applicant to register as quickly as possible by submitting the completed form and a photocopy of their social security card to the Missouri Department of Health, Fee Receipts Unit, P.O. Box 570, Jefferson City, MO 65102. The form may be faxed to 573-522-6981 to ensure a priority response. If no social security card is available, the only acceptable substitute is a driver’s license (if the SSN is used as the ID number); a military ID; a Medicare card; or the Social Security Administration statement provided when application is made for a replacement card (as long as it has the SSN identified, the name appears on the statement and it is initialed or signed by a SSA representative). Registrants (and all their adult household members) who are foster parents, respite providers, or are applying to provide those services must check the foster parent box in Section A to avoid having to pay the registration fee. The licensing worker may telephone the FCSR at 1-866-422-6872 to make a background screening request. Generally information will be available within two weeks. An oral report will be given at the time of the call and will be followed with a written report to both the requestor and the registrant within 48 hours. REGISTRATION IS ONLY REQUIRED ONCE. If completing a background screening for re-licensure, the worker needs to only call the FCSR. State and national criminal record checks will be completed for each adult household member. Fingerprints are now required. The Missouri State Highway Patrol (MSHP) will complete a state criminal record check and then electronically send the fingerprint images to the FBI for a national search of criminal records. The criminal record check may reveal open and closed record information on individuals consisting of arrests, prosecutor and court actions, correctional supervision and release dates, as well as sexual offender registration information as defined under 589.400, RSMo. All alcohol and drug related traffic offenses are considered reportable criminal offenses. The Children’s Division Background Screening Investigative Unit (BSIU) will be the point of entry with the MSHP. Send two Applicant fingerprint cards to the Background Screening Investigative Unit (BSIU), Children’s Division, P.O. Box 88, Jefferson City, Mo 65103. Pre-printed “Fingerprint Applicant” cards (Form #FD-258) may be ordered from the warehouse. The card has the number M0920360Z printed in the ORI field. This is the Originating Agency Identifier number that has been assigned to BSIU. The number conveys to the Highway Patrol and the FBI that all reports will be sent to BSIU and paid for by the Children’s Division. Each card must be signed by the person being fingerprinted. The “Employer and Address” field must have the local Children’s Division (CD) requesting the report. If a contracted agency is completing the assessment, state the contractor’s name but place it within parentheses under the local office name. This information will only be used by BSIU and will show where the completed report is to be sent. The “Reason Fingerprinted” field must indicate the associated statutes for supervision over minors, 43.540 RSMo, and the sex offender statute 589.400 RSMo. Fingerprinting Fingerprinting for respite and court ordered placement providers is optional until such time that funding is made available. If requesting such fingerprints, attach a check or money order made payable to the Criminal Record History Fund. The cost is $14.00 for the MSHP and $24.00 for the FBI ($38.00 total) and will be at the expense of the applicant. The completed reports will be sent to BSIU and then forwarded to the local CD office. The MSHP response will be received first. After the FBI has completed its search, any results will be forwarded to the MSHP, who will then forward the results to BSIU. Examine Case.net, the Missouri State Courts Automated Case Management System, for any reference to Orders of Protection filed, either for a child or adult. There are limits to the use of Case.net. Case.net is not yet statewide so will not include all county circuit courts. Also, at this time public view does not include identifiers such as social security and birth dates; so, it is difficult to determine whether the individual you are searching is the same as one found in Case.net. In locations where Case.net is not yet available, check with the circuit court for any pertinent information, including a record of Orders of Protection filed, both for a child or an adult. Additional circuit courts may need to be contacted if there is reason for concern. Any fee charged by the circuit court will be paid by the applicant. Except for the specific felony convictions listed below, a criminal history, child abuse/neglect history, or other review information does not automatically preclude licensure. Staff should determine the relevance of all such findings to child caring responsibilities, and should seek guidance from supervisors. A supervisor must review and evaluate the background information if there is a record of conviction (other than those listed below) and/or child abuse and if the decision is to approve the home study. The supervisor's review and decision to approve/disapprove must be documented. FELONY CONVICTIONS Staff may not approve the application of any person in which a record check reveals that a felony conviction for child abuse or neglect, spousal abuse, a crime against children (including child pornography), or a crime involving violence, including rape, sexual assault, or homicide. Staff may also not approve the application of any person, who in the past five years, has had a court of competent jurisdiction report a felony conviction for physical assault, battery, or a drug-related offense. For the purpose of this policy, a ""felony conviction by a court of competent jurisdiction"" is defined as a criminal court conviction for a felony offense as defined by law in the jurisdiction that the offense took place. NECESSARY ACTION: Review the memorandum with all Children’s Service Staff. Please contact Mary Kay Kliethermes or Amy Poyser, ICPC Child Placement Coordinators, at 573-751-2981 if you have any questions.

SIMMENS, DIRECTOR","This memorandum is to provide new policy effective, January 28, 2004, in the background screening requirements when licensing and re-licensing foster, kinship, relative and adoption resource families. These enhancements will include registration with the Family Care Safety Registry prior to licensure, the use of fingerprints for criminal record searches by the Missouri State Highway Patrol (MSHP) and national Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), a search of Case.net and circuit court records, and contact with child protection agencies in previous states of residence. From the date of this memorandum through June 30, 2004, the Children’s Division will absorb the expense of fingerprinting for the licensure and relicensure of resource families. (This includes the fingerprinting that is now a requirement for adoption update background screening.) A budget item request has been made to enable the division to continue to cover the expense of fingerprinting. Fingerprinting for court ordered placements (CTO) and respite providers is optional until such time that funding is received to cover the additional expense. In the meantime, any fingerprinting of respite and CTO providers will be done at their expense. Special procedures for criminal record searches in cases of emergency placement are also covered in this memorandum.

The MSHP response will be received first. After the FBI has completed its search, any results will be forwarded to the MSHP, who will then forward the results to BSIU. Per FBI guidelines, FBI reports can be released to local county offices and made available in court. FBI rap sheets cannot be released to contractors or to private entities. Even if a contractor has requested the information to complete an assessment, they are not allowed access to the report. The local office will have the responsibility to convey to the contractor one of the following: 1) The report is clear; proceed with the assessment, or 2) The report revealed something that must be explored. The contractor will then be requested to refer the family to the local office before continuing the assessment. Local office staff will then meet with the applicant and determine whether the applicant will be allowed to proceed with the application. If the applicant is selected out, the local office staff must inform the family in writing and notify the contractor There is a delayed fingerprinting process that will be followed in the cases of the emergency placement of a child. The Children’s Service worker or juvenile officer must request the local law enforcement to search the Missouri Uniform Law Enforcement System (MULES) for each adult in the household. MULES is an electronic communication system strictly used for law enforcement purposes, but permission has been granted to allow the CD access to the information in cases of the emergency placement of children. The FBI has approved the use of a Purpose Code “X” to be used by law enforcement agencies that will allow the delay of fingerprints when placing a child in an emergency situation. However, fingerprints must be submitted to the FBI within 15 days of the MULES check. To meet that deadline, the Children’s Services worker must submit the fingerprints immediately to BSIU.  When a court or Children’s Service worker approaches a law enforcement agency about providing this type of check, the law enforcement agency must determine if in fact the situation in question constitutes emergency placement or not. The Children’s Service worker or juvenile officer requesting the MULES inquiry is required to follow up with the local law enforcement agency if no fingerprints will be submitted due to a disqualifier found on the person’s criminal record that would prevent the placement and the individual is not contesting the criminal record. The local law enforcement has been advised by the MSHP that it is their responsibility to maintain a dissemination log to track any delayed fingerprints. If the Children’s Division fails to notify law enforcement that the delayed fingerprints will not be submitted, our agency could lose the right to delay fingerprinting in the future. Examine Case net, the Missouri State Courts Automated Case Management System, for any reference to Orders of Protection filed, either for a child or adult. There are limits to the use of Case.net. Case.net is not yet statewide so will not include all county circuit courts. Also, at this time public view does not include identifiers such as Social Security and birth dates; so, it is difficult to determine whether the individual you are searching is the same as one found in Case.net. In  locations where Case.net is not yet available, check with the circuit court for any pertinent information, including a record of Orders of Protection filed, both for a child or an adult. Additional circuit courts may need to be contacted if there is reason for concern. Any fee charged by the circuit court will be paid by the applicant. NECESSARY ACTION: Review this memorandum with all Children’s Division staff. As this will be a change in practice for Resource Development Contract providers, a letter with the memorandum will be sent to the contractors by Central Office. Order a supply of “Fingerprint Applicant Cards”, Form FD-258 from E-Store. The following sections have been changed in the Child Welfare Manual Intranet site: Section 6, Chapter 3.1, “Foster/Kinship Family Assessment” Section 6, Chapter 3.4, “Dual Licensing” Section 6, Chapter 3, Attachment A, “Guide for Conducting Foster/Kinship Family Assessments” Section 6, Chapter 3, Attachment C, “Foster/Kinship Family Assessment Recording Outline” Section 6, Chapter 3, Attachment D, “Guide For Conducting Renewal Assessment” All comments and questions regarding this memorandum should be cleared through supervisory channels.

SIMMENS, DIRECTOR","REFERENCE: CHILDREN’S DIVISION DISCUSSION: The purpose of this Memorandum is to introduce the integration of the Structured Decision Making (SDM) model into Missouri’s approach to addressing child abuse and neglect (CA/N) as well as enhancements to the Child Abuse/Neglect Hotline Unit (CANHU) Protocol –process and tools and call management technology.  SDM integration and CANHU enhancements will involve policy and procedural revisions in all areas of Child Abuse and Neglect, as well as the introduction and revision of various forms. A large portion of the CA/N system enhancements discussed in this memorandum have been introduced and tested in the field and are ready for full implementation, but some of it is still in the testing and development phase.   We ask for your cooperation and patience as we continue to make adjustments in order to tailor the tools and processes to fully support workers. As you know, The Children’s Research Center assisted Missouri to develop risk and safety tools for use in the field and tools for CANHU to use in determining response priority and track assignment.  The risk and safety tools are based on research.  Training was provided throughout the state and tools have been implemented statewide.  The tools developed for CANHU were placed on hold in early spring as it was determined that additional processes and tools were needed to comprehensively support intake and screening activities at CANHU. Structured Decision Making (SDM) Process: The SDM process developed by the Children’s Research Center (CRC) is designed to improve the effectiveness of Missouri’s child protective services by introducing structure to critical decision points in the child welfare system;  increasing the consistency and validity of decision making; and targeting resources to families most at risk. CHANGES TO THE CHILD ABUSE/NEGLECT HOTLINE UNIT (CANHU) Call Management Technology: The new call management technology ( planned for implementation early next year) was developed to improve responsiveness at CANHU allowing emergency calls to be queued ahead of non-urgent calls; and providing real time data to monitor call volume.  This will ultimately result in the elimination of busy signals for reporters; and quicker response to emergency calls. When an individual calls the CA/N hotline, there will be an identifying greeting, followed by instructions to hang up and call 911 if it is an immediate/life threatening emergency.  The reporter will then be requested to call back to complete the CA/N report.  All calls not directed to call 911 will be guided to a CANHU worker, as available with emergency calls receiving immediate response and other calls possibly waiting until a worker is available to take the call.  Workers will manage calls using new CANHU Protocol as described below: CANHU Protocol: The new CANHU protocol is designed to manage interviews with callers more thoroughly, improving the accuracy and consistency of call classification among workers.  \ The protocol process opens with a set of structured entry questions which guide workers down appropriate pathways, based on types of concern(s) raised by the caller.  Key questions for each pathway were developed to assist the worker in gathering necessary information and determining if it meets criteria for CA/N reports, CA/N referrals or  “documented calls” (DOC: formerly known as UTI).  If a CA/N report is taken workers are guided in determining response priority and track assignment.  Once an interview is concluded, the worker will proceed to a set of exit cards based on the call classification (CAN report, referral, DOC). Each caller will know how the call was classified and what action will be taken. The SDM process plays a significant role in the new CANHU Protocol.  Specifically, three SDM screening and classification functions have been built into CANHU Protocol questions.  They include: CA/N Screen-In Criteria – These questions address criteria concerning whether a call is classified as a child abuse and neglect report for investigation or family assessment, a referral or a documented call (DOC).  If screened-in, the call is accepted as a CA/N report or a referral and is sent to the county office.  If the report is screened out, the call is documented and entered into the database, but no further action is taken. SDM Response Priority – Criteria to determine the time frame in which the family should be contacted is also built in the CANHU Protocol.  There are three response levels.  These levels take the place of the “Emergency Contact” field in the CA/N automated system.   However, current policy regarding initial contact with the children in the home remains in effect. Note:  Missouri statutes have not changed and all calls are to be initiated in 24 hours. (RSMo 210.145.4)  For investigations, child(ren) must be seen within 3 hour for emergency situations and initiated within 24 hours for non-emergency cases.  For CA/N reports when the only allegation is educational neglect, victims must be seen within 72 hours.  For Family Assessments, all children in the household must be seen within 72 hours and contact must be initiated within 24 hours, unless the situation is an emergency. Level 1 (3 hours) – This is equivalent to an emergency report.  Face-to-face contact with all victim(s) listed on the CA/N-1 must be made within three hours from the receipt of the report.  A face-to-face contact with all other children living in the household must be made within 72 hours.  Available resources shall be utilized to locate the children, including law enforcement assistance; Level 2 (24 hours) – Face-to-face contact with all victim(s) listed on the CA/N-1 must be made within 24 hours from receipt of the report.  A face-to-face contact with other children residing in the home must occur within 72 hours; Note:  Investigations and family assessments with a level 2 response require a face-toface contact with the child(ren) victim(s) and must be initiated within 24 hours. Level 3 (72 hours) – Face-to-face contact with all children (victims and home residents) must be made within 72 hours from receipt of the report.  Initial contact for Investigations must be within 24 hours. Note:  Face-to-face contact can be made by members of the multidisciplinary team (mandated reporters such as juvenile officer, or law enforcement personnel).  Initial contacts can include phone calls or contact with appropriate persons in an attempt to make a home visit. CANHU Protocol Cards Testing: CANHU Protocol Cards are in a testing phase presently and printed on tabbed flip cards that are easily navigated, however this process will eventually be part of the automated CA/N system.  During this testing period, half of each shift of CANHU staff will practice this process, while the other half will serve as the control group by utilizing the old procedure.  Following the conclusion of the experiment all CANHU staff will use the protocol process. Response Priority Testing: Also during a testing phase of development, reports will initially be coming to the local division office with either “Response Priority One, Two or Three” or “emergency or non- emergency”.   This is for the purpose of comparison.  The worker should treat them as they come in and document on the CPS-1 whether there is a Priority Response Level or it is an emergency or non-emergency status. SDM Track Assignment Guidelines – Also built into the CANHU Protocol are criteria designed to determine if the screened-in report is an investigation (I) or an assessment (A).  Track Assignment will now be completed at CANHU prior to being sent to the local division office and displayed in the CA/N automated system and on the CA/N-1 form printed through the automated system. Track Assignment Testing: During this experimental period all CANHU staff will assign track. Field staff will need to review reports as they come in to assess whether the appropriate track has been assigned or whether additional information received warrants a track change. The decision to change the track assignment must be reviewed and approved by the worker’s supervisor.   The CS-27, “Child Abuse/Neglect Screening Form”, formally used by the field to determine track assignment, is now called “CPS Classification Reassignment Update Screen” and will now be used for track changes.  If the track change is approved, the change in track assignment must be entered into the CA/N automated system using the ATRU transaction.  Field staff should continue to record the worker and supervisor ID in the CA/N automated system using the ATRU transaction at the time the report is received in the county office.    Central office staff will monitor these track changes in an effort to maintain consistency and accuracy of appropriate track assignment as well as analyze and identify trends county and statewide where the track assignment has been updated.  (See attached examples of revised CA/N System screens: AI25, ATRI, ATRU, AUPD, and CAN1.) INVESTIGATIONS/FAMILY ASSESSMENT RESPONSE TOOLS Child Protection Services Response Tool (CPS-1) and the Safety Assessment (Part B) CPS-1A :  In conjunction with the introduction of SDM to the investigation/family assessment process comes the new Child Protection Services Response Tool (CPS-1 ) and the Safety Assessment (Part B) CPS-1A. The CPS-1 and the CPS-1A will be used when responding to Child Abuse/Neglect (CA/N) reports.  The CPS-1 and CPS-1A will replace the CA/N-4 for Investigations and the current CS-16 for Family Assessments. A revised form of the CS-16 will continue to be used for Family-Centered Services (FCS) and Family-Centered Out-of Home Care (FCOOHC) cases. Safety Assessment: The first part of the SDM safety assessment is located on the second page of the CPS-1 and Part B is on the CPS-1A.  The purpose of the safety assessment is to help determine whether any child is in immediate danger of serious physical harm, who may require a protective intervention and to determine what interventions should be maintained or initiated to provide appropriate protection.  Safety of the child(ren) in the home shall be an on-going concern during the investigation and family assessment. The safety assessment replaces the CS-15 Safety Factor Determination for investigations and page 3 in the CS-16.  The CPS-1 Safety Assessment and the CPS1A is to be completed for all investigations and family assessments during or immediately following the initial visit with a family in response to a child abuse/neglect report.  The Safety Assessment is used to guide decisions on whether or not the child(ren) may remain in the home, or if the child(ren) must be protectively placed.  The Safety is also used prior to a child returning home after being placed in Family-Centered Out-of-Home Care (FCOOHC). Risk Assessment: The SDM Risk Assessment is designed to identify families, which have low, moderate, high, or very high probabilities of future abuse or neglect.  By completing the risk assessment, the worker obtains an objective appraisal of the likelihood that a family will maltreat their children in the next 18 to 24 months.  The difference between risk levels is substantial.  High risk families have significantly higher rates of subsequent referral and substantiation than low risk families, and are more often involved in serious abuse or neglect incidents.  When risk is clearly defined and objectively quantified the agency can ensure that resources are targeted to higher risk families because of the greater potential to reduce subsequent maltreatment. Note: The risk assessment in used only when there are children in the home.  If children are removed from the home during the investigation/family assessment or from an on going FCS case, the use of the SDM safety and risk tools are suspended, unless at least one child remains in the home, or until the children are returned. The Safety Reassessment (CS-16D): The Safety Reassessment (CS-16D) is a critical follow up piece to the Safety Assessment.  The Safety Reassessment enables the worker to assess child safety, determine if previously identified factors have been resolved, or if safety factors have increased.  A Safety Reassessment is required whenever a child(ren) is removed during the investigation/family assessment.  The reassessment is then completed to guide decision making on return of the child(ren).  A child must be safe or conditionally safe prior to returning home. The CD Worker will complete the safety reassessment tool: Prior to a child(ren) returning to the home following out-of-home placement during the investigation/family assessment period. At the expiration of the initial safety plan. On any case whenever new information becomes available that indicates a threat to the safety of the child(ren). Risk Reassessment (CS-16E): The Risk Reassessment (CS-16 E) assesses risk of future child maltreatment and assists workers in evaluating whether risk levels have decreased, remained the same or have increased since the initial risk assessment. The Risk Assessment is to be completed at the conclusion of every investigation/family assessment in which there are children who remain in the home.   The risk assessment identifies the level of risk of future maltreatment and is used to guide the decision to close or open the investigation/family assessment for ongoing services.  The following chart shows the recommended case open/close decisions based on the risk level for investigations and family assessments: Risk-Based Case Open/Close Guidelines Risk Level Investigations Family Assessments Probable Cause Unsubstantiated Low Close Close Close Moderate Open/Close Close Open/Close High Open Open/Close w/referral Open/Close w/referral Very High Open Open/Close w/referral Open/Close w/referral Note:  There may be unique circumstances in which it is appropriate to open low risk cases (for example, court-ordered services), or close very high risk cases (for example, family moved out of state).  Reasons for opening or closing cases outside of the recommended guidelines should be clearly documented in the case record. Priority of Initial Client Contact after a Case Opening Based on SDM Risk : Prior to signing off on a CA/N investigation/family assessment, the Supervisor will review the CPS-1and will determine the priority of the initial face to face interview with the family based on the following SDM risk levels: • High or Very High Risk - within one (1) working day; • Moderate Risk - within five (5) working days; and • Low Risk - within ten (10) working days. If the case referral was not due to a CA/N investigation/family assessment, the supervisor's appraisal of the potential risk to the children and overall family situation will determine when treatment follow-up contact by the Family-Centered Services (FCS) worker is needed. THIS SHOULD NOT EXCEED TEN (10) WORKING DAYS FROM CASE ASSIGNMENT. Revised CS-16: Although we saw great value in the comprehensive approach that the original CS-16 provided when conducting a family assessment, such as the genogram, ecomap, pattern of behavior and timeline, these tools more appropriately fit into the treatment phase of family intervention. The purpose of this revision was to streamline the CS-16 to better fit the treatment process and to exclude parts of the form applicable only in a Family Assessment.  The result was a less lengthy, more user friendly CS-16 that contains the essential pieces of a thorough family-centered assessment with the added structure and standardization that the SDM safety and risk assessments provide. Family Contact Guidelines for In-Home Cases: The Family Risk Assessment provides reliable, valid information on the risk to children of future abuse and neglect.  Appropriate use of this assessment data is key to ensuring better protection of children.  Therefore, for cases that have been opened for ongoing FCS services or for FCOOHC cases in which there are children who remain in the home, the risk level is used to guide the minimum amount of contact with the family each month.  These guidelines are considered ""best practice"" and help focus staff resources on the highest risk cases.  They dictate the minimum number of face-to-face and collateral contacts with the family each month, however workers will use their best judgment for individual cases to best determine whether more contacts are needed. The definition and purpose of a face-to-face “contact” is: to monitor developments in the case, to observe interaction between the caregiver and the child(ren), to facilitate implementation of the Case Plan, and to assess progress with the plan or possible revision to the plan.  It is used to guide monthly contacts while the case is open, and is reviewed at each risk reassessment until the case is closed. The risk level determines the overall minimum contact standards for the family.  The “Children’s Division Minimum Contact Standards” represent how many of the overall contact standards must be met by the CD worker.  The remaining contacts may be met by a contracted in-home service provider who is working with the family as part of the family’s case plan.  However, if the contracted service provider was unable to complete monthly contacts, the CD worker is responsible for meeting the overall contact standards. The CD worker is responsible for making all collateral contacts.  Collateral contacts include phone contact with school personnel and day care providers, medical personnel who have recently seen or treated the child(ren), parenting class instructors, etc. “Minimum Contact Guidelines for In-Home Family Cases” refers to FCS Cases or for FCOOHC cases where children are in the home and represents the recommended number of contacts that workers should have with families according to their assessed risk level.(likelihood of future maltreatment):  (For FCOOHC cases, where there are no children in the home refer to Child Welfare Manual Section 4.7.3.1: Meeting and Working with the Family for frequency of worker visits with parent/caretaker) Minimum Contact Guidelines for In-Home Family Cases Risk Level Overall Contact Guidelines (by CD and other service providers) CD Minimum Contact Guidelines Very High 3 face-to-face/month 2 face-to-face/month and 3 collateral contacts/month High 2 face-to-face/month 1 face-to-face/month and 3 collateral contacts/month Moderate 1 face-to-face/month 1 face-to-face/month and 2 collateral contacts/month Low 1 face-to-face/month 1 face-to-face/month and 1 collateral contacts/month NECESSARY ACTION: Review this Memorandum with all Children’s Division staff; Policy changes to the Child Welfare Manual, regarding the new CANHU Protocol including the integration of SDM CA/N Screen-in Criteria, Priority Response and SDM Track Assignment Guidelines will be forthcoming Review revised Child Welfare Manual sections on the DSS Intranet (http://dss.missouri.gov/cd/info/cwman/index.htm ): Section 1 Chapter 1.5.3 Implementing Contacts with the Family Section 1 Chapter 1.5.4 Initiating the Follow-up Family Assessment on an Open FCS Case Section 2 Chapter 4 Chapter Overview Section 2 Chapter 4 Attachment G Collection of Evidence Section 2 Chapter 4 Attachment M Intensive In-Home Services (IIS) Section 2 Chapter 4 Attachment R Physical Abuse Section 2 Chapter 4.1 Investigation Response Section 2 Chapter 4.2 Involving Law Enforcement Section 2 Chapter 4.5 Change to Family Assessment Section 2 Chapter 5.1 Family Assessment Response Section 2 Chapter 5.2 Change to Investigation Response Section 2 Chapter 5.5.4 Assessment of Safety Section 2 Chapter 5.5.5 Assessment of Risk Section 3 Chapter 1.1 Probable Cause Cases Section 3 Chapter 1.5 Family Assessment and Services Cases Section 3 Chapter 2.2 Procedures Applicable to All Case Types Section 3 Chapter 2.3 Case Assignment Section 3 Chapter 3.3 Social Worker and Supervisor Considerations Section 3 Chapter 4 Attachment A Problem Pregnancy Services Section 3 Chapter 4 Attachment C Crisis Intervention Funds Section 3 Chapter 6.3 Reassessment Section 3 Chapter 6.1 Policy Requirements Relating to the Evaluation Section 3 Chapter 8.1 Policy Requirements Relating to Case Closure Section 3 Chapter 10.2.1 Initial Case Assignment Section 3 Chapter 10.3.2 Assessment Section 3 Chapter 10.3.7 Evaluation and Case Closure Section 3 Chapter 10.4.1 Reviews by First Level Supervisors Section 4 Chapter 1 Attachment A Assessment of Safety and Factors in Recommending Out-of-Home Placement Section 4 Chapter 1 Attachment B Child Welfare Housing Assistance Section 4 Chapter 1.5 Factors in Recommending Out-of-Home Care Section 4 Chapter 3.1.1 Initial Child Contact Section 4 Chapter 3.1.2 Protective Custody of the Child Section 4 Chapter 3.1.3.a Investigation and Protective Custody Section 4 Chapter 7.3.7 Administrative Activities Section 4 Chapter 22.4 Procedures for Closing Case Section 5 Chapter 1.1.1 CA/N Investigation Section Section 5 Chapter 1.1.2 Family Assessments Completed in Response to CA/N Reports Section 5 Chapter 1.1.3 Assessments And Services Section Section 5 Chapter 1.1.12 Domestic Violence Section Section 5 Chapter 1.2.2 Recording Guidelines - Investigations Section 5 Chapter 1.3 Recording Guidelines - Family Assessments (Ongoing Work With Families) Section 5 Chapter 1.3.2 Subsequent Recording Section 6 Chapter 3.1 Foster/Kinship Family Assessment Review revisions to CA/N automated system screens: AI25, ATRI, ATRU, AUPD, and CAN1.

The workgroup participants included resource parents, members of the Missouri State Foster Care and Adoption Board, contracted Elevated Needs Level A Trainers, Children’s Division staff and representatives of three contracted agencies who provide resource development and foster care case management services. Elevated Needs Level A Behavior Management Tool The research and review of the form supports the CS-11 form used with Parenting Skills training curriculum is based on outdated behavior science compared to current science regarding trauma, and brain development. The training is not meeting the unique needs of our foster youth population. The recommendation of the workgroup is to discontinue requiring resource parents who are parenting foster youth identified as needing Elevated Needs Level A services to complete the CS-11 and the companion form, CS-12. There are many tools available to work with a youth in learning to manage his/her emotions and behaviors. The resource parent may inquire of the foster youth’s therapist or school personnel a recommendation of a tool which might work best for the specific foster youth’s treatment needs. There will no longer be specifically referenced required tools to use for elevated needs treatment in policy. Elevated Needs Training Curriculum The Children’s Division no longer recommends using the Parenting Skills training curriculum introduced in 1992 for the 18 hours of Level A training requirements. The curriculum does not address brain development as related to behavior and emotions nor does it address trauma issues. The training topics required to be covered in the 18 hours of Elevated Needs Level A training curriculum have been revised. The lists of approved Elevated Needs Level A and Level B training curricula that a licensed resource provider may complete to receive training credit for Elevated Needs Level A or Level B training requirements is posted on the Resource Development program page on the Children’s Division Intranet and on the Foster Parenting Information page on the Internet. Training Codes The codes in FACES to use for entering training credit for completion of elevated needs training are located in the in-service training category. Level A - V206 Level B - V892, V893, V894, V895, V896 The training hours completed for Level A and Level B count toward pre-service and in- service training. Enhancements made to the FACES pre-service training screen now include training codes for elevated needs training in the pre-service service category. Level A - V009 Level B - V010 The work around instructions for putting elevated needs training as “other pre-service” training have been removed from the FACES Instructions for Resource Licensing and Resource Approval and the training instructions in the document revised to include the new pre-service codes. Incentive Payment Elimination There will no longer be an incentive payment for completing a form. Beginning April 1, 2016, there will no longer be a payment code of CENT in FACES. The licensed resource providers approved to provide Elevated Needs Level A services who received the incentive payment during the past year will receive a letter informing them of the policy change. The identified resource development worker for the resource home will receive a copy of the letter. Workers should have conversations with these resource providers identifying needed services for the Elevated Needs Level A foster youth placed in their homes.

Other Approved In-Service Training : Licensed resource providers are required to complete a minimum of 30 hours, 32 for Elevated Needs Level B providers, of in-service training during each two year licensure period. Training opportunities should be provided by the agency who supervises the license or approval to assist the resource providers in completing the required training hours. Each agency should notify resource providers of training opportunities available. Resource providers may participate in training not sponsored, facilitated, or provided by the Children’s Division to meet the training hour requirement and to meet their training needs as identified on the Professional Family Development Plan, CD-100. These types of trainings are referred to as Other Approved In-Service Training. To receive training credit for trainings not identified in Section 6 Chapter 2 Subsection 5 of the Child Welfare Manual, the CD-114 must be completed. Prior approval to attend trainings and receive training credit is not required. However, prior approval must be obtained for any monetary reimbursement to be applied for allowable mileage and or babysitting. Obtaining prior approval to participate in Other Approved In-Service Training ensures that training hour credit will be granted. Training Methods: The preferred method of training delivery is instructor led.

As a result of input from the State Foster Care Advisory Board, the language used for describing the core competencies as listed in the in-service section of policy and located on the CD-100 has been modified to provide enhanced description of those skills that are to be present if that competency is achieved and/or progressing. Resource providers participate in competency based training to enhance and increase their skill level for the five STARS competencies; Protecting and Nurturing, Meeting Developmental Needs and Addressing Developmental Delays, Supporting Relationships Between Children and Their Families, Connecting Children to Safe, Nurturing Relationships Intended to Last a Lifetime, and Working as a Member of a Professional Team. The required skill level for each competency increases as the resource provider becomes more experienced, therefore, the explanation/definition of those skills are also modified. The increase of skill level is identified uniquely: Pre-service STARS training: The competencies are identified as to what skill level is expected before foster youth are placed in the home. In-service Training: The core competencies are identified with language that recognizes the increased skill level to continue licensure. Elevated Training: The competencies required for Advanced training, Level A, and Specialized training, Level B, foster care are discussed in Step 11 of the STARS training curriculum. Step 11 of the STARS resource provider training curriculum provides the licensing worker and resource provider with the tools to determine the skill level and training needs for the resource parent. The compilation of the skills and training needs is accomplished by completing the Professional Family Development Plan, CD-100. The purpose of completing the CD-100 is to: Assess the family’s learning needs; Identify non-training barriers to their performance of the essential tasks of fostering; Develop a plan to build upon their knowledge and skills; and Guide the agency’s overall system for enhancing the competencies of its foster families. The Professional Family Development Plan is tailored uniquely to the skills and needs of the resource family and the foster youth placed in the home and is the key for providing support and training to promote successful resource parenting. Completion of the CD-100 should be a face-to-face joint process between the resource provider and worker that assesses the provider’s learning needs in an ongoing, proactive, and purposeful way. The form has been revised to allow for unlimited characters to be typed within the form fields. Workers are to begin using the revised CD-100 as of the date of the memorandum.

YOUTH WITH ELEVATED NEEDS-LEVEL A AND LEVEL B- REVISION OF THE BEHAVIORAL FOSTER CARE AND CAREER PROGRAMS,Missouri,Memo,"2024, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010","Contact and directory information, Services while in care - Other, Subsidies - Other","REGIONAL EXECUTIVE STAFF, CIRCUIT MANAGERS, AND CHILDREN’S DIVISION STAFF","PAULA NEESE, DIRECTOR","DISCUSSION: The purpose of this memorandum is to introduce changes to the Behavioral Foster Care (BFC) and Career Programs. The changes come as a result of a workgroup composed of staff from each of the regions, Regional Directors, resource providers, and staff from Central Office. The goal of the group was to develop a program to improve child stability and well-being, enhance current policy, and standardize the BFC and Career programs statewide. The recommendations from the workgroup resulted in the following changes: An Improved Title Foster Care for Youth with Elevated Needs is a program designed for the youth with identifiable and documented moderate or serious emotional and/or behavioral needs. The new name more accurately captures the needs of the child instead of focusing on the negative behaviors. Youth with Elevated Needs-Level A will be the new name for the BFC program and Youth with Elevated Needs-Level B will be the new name for the Career program. Screening and Assessment of Need This memorandum also introduces the Youth with Elevated Needs Referral Checklist, CD-136, Youth with Elevated Needs Referral Form, CD-137, and Youth with Elevated Needs Six Month Review Form, CD-138, which will be used statewide in an effort to provide more consistency across the regions. At the time of the initial referral, the Children’s Service Worker will complete the Referral Checklist and Referral Form with the required attachments and submit to their supervisor for approval. The referral packet will then be presented at the staffing. The Six Month Review Form will be completed during the six month staffing to determine whether the child continues to meet the criteria for the Youth with Elevated Needs program. In addition, this memorandum eliminates the use of the Residential Treatment Referral Form, CS-9, as a part of the Youth with Elevated Needs referral packet. Staff will no longer be required to complete the CS-9 when making a referral for a youth with elevated needs. Staffing Participants The policy change requires the case manager, supervisor, and designated facilitator (circuit/regional specialist or consultant) to attend the staffing. The designated facilitator is responsible for ensuring that youth staffed for the Youth with Elevated Needs program truly meet the criteria for the program and ensuring that youth are placed in the least restrictive environment as their needs decrease. The list of attendees who should be invited to the staffing was also modified and changed accordingly in the manual. Those who are unable to attend the staffing should be encouraged to submit their input prior to the staffing for consideration. Competencies Because some knowledge and skills are essential before children are placed with families, competencies were developed for resource providers of youth with elevated needs. Competencies take into account the knowledge of the resource provider and their ability to perform the necessary skills to successfully parent a youth with elevated needs. The following competencies will assist resource workers in assessing the needs of the resource providers and identifying services to achieve these competencies: Promote Successful Integration into the Family and the Community Understanding how much supervision the youth requires (before placement occurred and during current placement) Assist the youth in adjusting to a new school and community Transitioning the youth into another setting Meeting Exceptional Care Needs (for Special Needs and/or Traumatized Youth) Addressing those needs that are not developmental (social, emotional, daily care) Understanding risk factors in the community, school and home setting Understanding but not diagnosing mental illness and other developmental delays Assessing Crisis Situations and Utilizing Proper Crisis Intervention/Prevention Understanding what a crisis is Using appropriate skill sets to deescalate crisis situations Understanding attention seeking behaviors and knowing when to respond Understanding power, authority and control Setting fair and consistent limits Understanding risk factors in the community, school and home setting Recognizing and Implementing Positive Approaches to Challenging Behaviors Identifying challenging behaviors early Clearly defining target behaviors Use of multidisciplinary service team for coordinating care Team based wrap around services STARS Training for Staff The STARS training for staff was designed to help workers understand the individual needs of the youth and to provide necessary support to resource providers. The training is not mandatory however, the workgroup recommended that licensing workers and staff who work with youth with elevated needs attend the training. Each region will have the discretion to determine when staff attend the training, and who will conduct the training. The training has been posted on the CD intranet and can be modified to fit the individual needs of the staff. Adoption Subsidy The policy has not changed with regards to the qualifications for adoption subsidy. Youth with Elevated Needs-Level A can qualify for adoption subsidy however Youth with Elevated Needs-Level B do not qualify for adoption subsidy. Section 4 Chapter 14 and Section 4 Chapter 16 have been updated and combined into Section 4 Chapter 14 to reflect the changes. The changes outlined in this memorandum will be effective as of tomorrow’s date. NECESSARY ACTION Review this memorandum with all Children’s Division staff.

HARRISON, ACTING DIRECTOR","DISCUSSION: The purpose of this memo is to introduce the revised Transportation Policy and the new Travel Expense Log, CD-106. Resource providers may receive mileage reimbursement for transportation costs as outlined in policy. The resource provider will complete the Travel Expense Log, CD-106, and submit it to the local CD staff for approval within thirty (30) days of the month that the trip occurred. Child Specific travel Allowable child specific transportation costs for vendors with AC, PP, behavioral or medical contracts continue to include: Medical care Counseling Visits with parent(s) Court FST and PPR meetings The providers may be reimbursed the current state mileage rate for all the above listed miles traveled using a Children’s Services Integrated Payment System Invoice, CS-65. Additional allowable child specific transportation are trips that are intended to support the case plan as approved by the Family Support Team and/or case manager and supervisor. The reimbursement for these trips may be made at the current state mileage rate for each mile over a 15 mile round trip using a CS-65. The first 15 miles of these trips will not be reimbursed. Any trip that is 75 miles round trip or over must have approval by the CD Regional Director or Designee. The written approval will be attached to the Travel Expense Log, CD-106, and CS-65 for submission of reimbursement. Transportation costs for any level of care for child care services is not an allowable cost, even if such services are part of the child’s case plan. The career level resource provider may be reimbursed at a per mile state rate for child specific transportation that is over a 200 mile round trip with Regional Director approval only. For cases that require frequent approval, the determination can be made at a Family Support Team meeting and a standing approval be granted for that frequent child specific trip. The approval in written form from the Regional Director or Designee will be attached to the travel Expense Log, CD-106 and the CS-65 for submission of reimbursement. A round trip is defined as leaving from point “A”, traveling to point “B” and returning to point “A”. Some round trips may not include the foster youth in the vehicle on the return trip, as when a youth is being dropped off to be picked up at a later time. Non Child Specific Transportation reimbursement will be paid to resource providers for trips over a 15 mile round trip for pre-service (after the license is approved and granted), in-service training, and Foster Parent Advisory Board Meetings.

RESOURCE PROVIDER TRAINING,Missouri,Memo,"2007, 2006","Administrative process, Birth parents, Contact and directory information, Foster parent licensing, Safety","REGIONAL EXECUTIVE STAFF, CIRCUIT MANAGERS AND CHILDREN’S DIVISION STAFF","PAULA NEESE, INTERIM DIRECTOR","DISCUSSION: The purpose of this memorandum is to introduce changes in policy and to update policy related to Council on Accreditation standards. This memorandum addresses policy related to resource provider training. The policy changes for this memo are contained in Section 4 Chapter 12, Section 6 Chapter 2 Attachment C, and Section 6 Chapter 3 Attachment D of the Child Welfare Manual. These changes include the use of the Professional Family Development Plan (CD-100), in service training hours and mandatory in service trainings, and suspension of the Professional Parenting payment. Professional Family Development Plan Staff must complete a Professional Family Development Plan (form CD-100) with each provider within 30 days of initial licensure and at the time of license renewal. This plan will outline the training goals of each family and must be reviewed on an annual basis. The purpose of the Professional Family Development Plan (PFDP) is to assess the family’s training needs and their goals as professional care givers. This document can be changed as the needs of the family and agency change. Staff will be able to utilize the Performance Based Criteria developed for foster, relative and kinship care providers. These criteria are based upon the STARS competencies and include the following: COMPETENCY – Protecting and Nurturing Accepts placements on an emergency basis with little notice. Maintains confidentiality of case information for children placed in their home (currently and previously). Maintains foster child’s belongings and assures those belongings go with the child when they move/return home. Does not discuss any permanency plan with the child until this plan becomes the case goal (i.e. discussing adoption while case goal remains reunification). COMPETENCY – Meeting developmental needs and addressing developmental delays Makes and keeps all medical, psychiatric, counseling, dental, and rehabilitation appointments including all required and emergency appointments. Maintains contact with the therapist on a regular basis for each child placed in the home. Knows and follows the treatment plan developed by the therapist for each child. Provides information on the child’s behavior to the worker and Family Support Team. Attends all IEP meetings and keeps the worker informed of the school plan for the child. Works with the biological family to help them understand and meet the special needs of the child. COMPETENCY – Supporting relationships between children and their birth families Cooperates with the family and sibling visitation plan. Is respectful of the birth family by not making derogatory comments about the family to the child(ren). Supervises visitation between the child and family/siblings when necessary and available. Provides mentoring to the birth parents to help work toward reunification. Provides transportation to and from visitation with the family as needed. Keeps birth parents informed of all appointments and school functions and invites them to these as appropriate. COMPETENCY – Connecting children to safe, nurturing relationships intended to last a lifetime Starts and maintains a life book on each child in their care to be sent with the child when they move or return home. Finds opportunities for the child(ren) to participate in activities in the community, school, church, etc. Supports the child’s involvement in activities outside of the foster home. Supports transitions into other settings such as adoptive placement, kinship/relative placement, reunification, or an independent living arrangement. COMPETENCY – Working as a member of a professional team Attends Family Support Team Meetings or provides written report on the child(ren). Knows and follows the Children’s Division policies and procedures. Supports the case plan developed by the Family Support Team even if they are not in agreement with the plan. Expresses their concerns regarding the case plan with the child’s worker and during team meetings. Keeps the case manager or service worker informed of all the child’s activities. Allows items purchased for the child to go with the child when they move or return home. Provides or makes arrangements for transportation for the child(ren) as needed. This is not a comprehensive list. Other criteria may be found in the STARS curriculum for each of the competencies. These criteria should be utilized in evaluating the performance of foster parents during their license renewal process and are an integral part of developing an appropriate Professional Development Plan. These criteria are also included in the CD-100 PFDP. For more information on the PFDP, please refer to the STARS Resource Development Specialist’s Handbook, Step 11. This handbook can be obtained by contacting the Children’s Division training unit. The current contact person is Linda Lefebvre ( Linda.L.Lefebvre@dss.mo.gov ). In-Service Training Pre-service training hours may no longer be counted toward the required 30 hours of in- service training for the first two year licensing period beginning with all homes licensed after the date of this memo. COA requires all alternative care providers to receive the following trainings: Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR), and First Aid training Certification is not required and these trainings may count towards in-service hours. Providers will not be required to complete the CPR and first aid training until their circuit is preparing for accreditation. If an alternative care provider receives CPR and/or first aid training as part of their job, they may count these hours toward their required in- service training hours. The CPR and First Aid trainings should be taught by a certified provider and local resources should be utilized whenever possible. The local Health Department and Red Cross are two possible sources for training in these areas. The codes for these trainings are V840 CPR Training and V898 First Aid Training. All alternative care providers are also required to have the following trainings: HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) – please review memo CS03-07 for information on how to obtain this training for alternative care providers. The code for this training is V980 , and Ready, Set, Fly (this is required for all homes providing care to any child age 14 or older) – this training is currently available through your regional office (ILP Specialists), however, this training will be available through the STARS curriculum as an in-service module beginning July 1, 2006. The code for this training is V706 . It is preferred that these hours are obtained within the first year of licensure. However, due to availability and time constraints across the state, families may take the courses at anytime during the first licensing period of two years. The majority of in-service training should come from traditional classroom training, however, some non-traditional training may be allowed. Non-traditional training must be approved by the Regional Director or designee. The total amount of non-traditional training accepted per licensing period is to be determined by the Regional Director based upon the availability of training and the training needs of the region. If a foster home does not comply with the plan developed for obtaining the required in- service training hours, the Children’s Services Worker should schedule a meeting between the family, the worker and supervisor. This meeting should address with the family the importance of complying with Licensing Rules and their license may be subject to revocation if they do not meet the requirement for in-service training within a specified time frame not to exceed six months unless approved by the Regional Director. The Division should begin the revocation process if licensing requirements are not met after this process. (The revocation process can be located in Section 6 Chapter 3.) Professional Parenting Payment The majority of our alternative care providers receive the Professional Parenting payment. This payment is provided to those providers who have completed STARS Pre- Service training and have satisfied the required In-Service training. Any provider receiving the Professional Parenting payment must complete the required in-service training hours, including relative and kinship care providers. If a foster parent does not receive the required number of hours of training during the licensing period, the professional parent payment may be suspended by closing the Professional Parent contract (CM-14). A Cooperative Agreement for the Purchase of Foster Care Services (CM-3) may need to be opened for maintenance payments to continue. Staff should contact the Contract Management unit in Central Office to close a CM-14 or open a CM- 3 contract. They can be reached at 573-526-0954. A plan must be developed between the foster parent and the Division to make up the necessary training hours. These hours will not count toward the next licensing period , only toward the previous licensing period. The foster parent would still be responsible for obtaining the required hours for the next licensing period. When dealing with a licensed couple, the professional parent payment would be suspended if either one of the couple do not meet the licensing requirements for in-service training. The couple is issued one license and thus both parties must be in compliance with the licensing rules for the payment to continue. This means that both parties must complete 30 hours (32 hours for career) of in-service training for each licensing period. Once the foster parent obtains the needed hours of training, the professional parent contract will be reopened and payment will be reinstated. They will not be reimbursed for any time they were not in compliance with the in-service training requirement. The payment may be prorated if necessary through payment on a CS-65. The Contract Management Unit should again be notified to reopen the CM-14. An exception may be made in the cessation of the professional parent payment if a viable reason is provided for not obtaining the necessary training. This exception must be approved by the Regional Director. The plan for obtaining the necessary training hours must still be completed and the payment may be suspended if the foster parent does not comply with the plan. NECESSARY ACTION: Review this memorandum with all Children’s Division staff. Review revised Child Welfare Manual chapters as indicated below. Any questions regarding this e-mail should be sent through normal supervisory channels. Share information from this memo with all licensed alternative care providers.

The seven items listed in the FCBR reinforce the Children’s Division’s mission and goals. Attached to this memo is a link to a poster containing the FCBR and a link to a document with smaller versions that can be printed and used as handouts. Posters must be displayed in all CD offices, Child placing agency offices, Residential facilities, Chafee provider offices, and Transitional Living agency offices. Children’s Division offices will receive posters via standard mail. Partner agencies will print the posters to be displayed in their offices. As part of this legislation, the FCBR must be provided and explained to all school aged children in foster care and his or her foster parent. The child’s case manager is responsible for providing an age appropriate explanation or arranging for this explanation to occur. A set of talking points (attached) has been developed to help guide staff in having age appropriate discussions with youth about the FCBR. This law prompted several changes to the Child Welfare Manual regarding the age at which a child should be invited to court hearings and family support team meetings. The age has been changed from 13 to 12 years old. Staff must invite children age 12 and over to family support team meetings when appropriate.

NEW DEFINITION OF RELATIVE FOSTER CARE PER CHAPTER 210.565 OF THE MISSOURI REVISED STATUTE,Missouri,Memo,"2024, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017","Administrative process, Contact and directory information, Definitions, Foster parent licensing, Kinship",CHILDREN’S DIVISION AND CONTRACTED STAFF,"TIM DECKER, DIRECTOR","DISCUSSION: The 2017 Missouri legislature passed Senate Bill 160 which redefined “relative” for the purpose of providing foster care services; “…the term “relative” means a grandparent or any other person related to another by blood or affinity or a person who is not so related to the child but has a close relationship with the child or the child’s family.” (Revised Missouri Statute 210.565). This definition begins August 28, 2017. In response to the legislative action, Children’s Division will no longer use the term “kinship” as a type of foster care resource provider. The relationship with a supportive relative is very important. If the relative applicant does not meet specified non-safety licensing requirements listed in Chapter 13 of the Code of State Regulations 35-60.080, consideration, based on the foster youth(s)’ needs, familiarity in the home and the close relationship the youth has with the applicant may be explored on a case by case basis for use of the waivers. Examples of those relative applicants that a worker might consider using a waiver to become licensed include: The foster youth is over six years of age has stayed with the relative previously and slept in the same room with their cousins of the opposite sex with no concerns The foster youth will be able to stay in the same school district but there are already 4 children living in the home and the youth and her two siblings will cause the home to be over the allowable five children living in the home The CD-152 form must be completed prior to the license begin date. The explanation of how using the waiver will pose no safety concerns must be written in the comments section, field #11, on the form. Once all approval signatures are obtained, the form must be sent to Central Office for data collection. A Systems Change Request has been submitted to address the changes that need to be made in FACES. Until FACES changes have been made, the following steps are to be taken for KH vendors: When it is time to renew a KH home that meets all license renewal requirements (including but not limited to 30 hours of in-service training, home assessment updated and signed, background checks received with no exclusionary history) close the KH home using the same date of expiration with close reason “discontinued services” and in the comments box enter the KH vendor is transitioning to an RH vendor per SB160. Open a RH application for the DVN on the FACES Application screen with the begin date the same date as the renewal begin date and approve the RH license on the Vendor License, Approval and Renewal screen with the same begin date to avoid any gap in maintenance payments.

The Reasonable and Prudent Parenting Standard is characterized by careful and sensible parental decisions which maintain the health, safety, and best interests of youth. These decisions are intended to encourage emotional and developmental growth and for youth in foster care to have experiences and opportunities and make supported decisions in the same manner as youth who are not being raised in alternative care. Resource parents are to use the standard when making decisions about the participation of youth in extracurricular, enrichment, cultural, and social activities as they would for their own children. The result of incorporating this standard into our practice is a foster care experience which is as “normal” as possible for youth who are living away from their families.

The Child Welfare Manual has been updated to include the training requirements for those resource providers serving children with elevated behavioral and emotional needs. A result of the new contract is policy regarding frequency of STARS training.  Previous policy stated that STARS sessions are limited to one a week and each session is to be conducted in a 3-hour block.  Policy has been revised allowing for more than one session to occur a day, however, the 9 sessions must be taught over a minimum of three (3) dates.

ADOPTION OF DIVISION CHILDREN BY RELATIVE PROVIDERS,Missouri,Memo,"2007, 2006","Adoption, Contact and directory information","REGIONAL EXECUTIVE STAFF, CIRCUIT MANAGERS, AND CHILDREN’S DIVISION STAFF","PAULA NEESE, INTERIM DIRECTOR","REFERENCE: CHILDREN’S DIVISION DISCUSSION: The purpose of this memorandum is to provide policy clarification regarding the requirements of relative care providers seeking to adopt children in Division custody.  The policy change is included in the Child Welfare Manual, Section 6, Chapter 2, Attachment B, Pre-Service and In-Service Training; STARS Competencies. Current policy states that those wanting to adopt must complete the 12 hours of “STARS, Making the Commitment to Adoption” Pre-Service training, also known as Spaulding.  Effective with the date of this memorandum, relative care providers are no longer required to complete Spaulding training in order to adopt the relative child placed in their home.  Foster and kinship care providers are still required to complete this training prior to adoption.  The Children’s Division strongly recommends that relatives complete the training as it provides prospective adoptive parents with tools and knowledge to assist in helping the child transition from alternative care to adoption as well as with information on some of the challenges to adopting a child in Division custody.  However, due to the family bond and prior relationship between the provider and foster child, it is no longer mandatory for relative providers to attend this training.  Relative providers are still required to complete the “STARS for the Caregiver Who Knows the Child” training. As discussed in memorandum CD06-37 relating to Resource Provider Training, the 27 hours of STARS pre-service training can not be counted toward a provider’s required in-service training hours.  However, Spaulding training may be counted toward those hours as not all providers complete this training prior to licensure and it is not required for licensure as a foster, relative or kinship care provider.

INFORMED CONSENT POLICY REVISIONS,Missouri,Memo,"2024, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018","Contact and directory information, Definitions",CHILDREN’S DIVISION AND CONTRACTED STAFF,"TIM DECKER, DIRECTOR","The purpose of this memorandum is to advise staff that revisions have been made to the informed consent policy for children and youth in Children’s Division custody found in Section 4 Chapter 24 Subsection 3 , of the Child Welfare Manual. Informed consent is the agreement to any medical or mental health treatment (e.g., medication, procedure, or service) given after the medical consenter has had the opportunity to receive sufficient information about its risks and benefits.  Making the best decisions about a youth’s health care means individuals providing that consent understand the role and responsibilities of a medical consenter. To ensure those authorized to give informed consent fully understand their role/responsibilities, Children’s Division is developing a self-instructional training to assist consenters.  The training will be posted on the Employee Learning Center (ELC) My Training Plan, and on the CD Intranet and internet website for contracted staff and resource parents.  Staff will be notified immediately once this required training is made available. NOTE: This revised policy will go into effect September 1, 2018.  Frontline practitioners, supervisors, and resource parents must successfully complete this training before providing consent.  Any other staff who anticipate being called upon to provide informed consent for a child/youth in CD custody must complete this training before doing so. Key revisions to policy include: Delineation of responsibilities and consenting authority between Children’s Division/contracted case management staff and resource parents. Routine vs. Non-Routine Treatment Only Children’s Division/contracted case management staff are authorized to consent to non-routine treatment Mental health services (behavioral therapy, psychiatric treatment, the initiation of psychotropic medications) are considered nonroutine treatment Staff shall not consent to the initiation of psychotropic medications without first having sought alternative non-pharmacological interventions for the child/youth. A mental health professional treating the child must make a recommendation for the child to be assessed by a qualified prescriber to determine the appropriateness of psychotropic medications. Training requirement for frontline practitioners, supervisors, and resource parents to serve as medical consenters. Expanded guidance on: Factors to consider, questions to ask, information to gather when providing informed consent. Parent engagement/role in medical/mental health treatment decisions. Children’s rights to be involved in the process of making routine and nonroutine treatment decisions. Requirement for separate and specific informed consent vs. broad consent for children/youth during inpatient psychiatric or residential treatment. Guidelines regarding consent/refusal for youth 18 years of age or older. Introduction of statewide clinical consultation and support through The Missouri Center of Excellence in Children’s Health Integration, Learning, and Development (The Center of Excellence). The Missouri Center for Excellence in Children’s Health Integration, Learning, and Development (The Center for Excellence) The Department of Social Services has entered into a contract with the University of Missouri-Columbia, Missouri Psychiatric Center for The Missouri Center for Excellence in Children’s Health Integration, Learning, and Development (The Center for Excellence).  Expected to be established and ready to begin consultation with staff on September 1, 2018, The Center for Excellence will serve in an oversight capacity and will allow for ongoing monitoring and consultation, including telehealth, to case managers and supervisors regarding behavioral health and medical needs and issues of children.  These goals will be achieved through the collaboration of multiple academic departments within MU Health Care’s School of Medicine. The Center for Excellence will provide clinical and support staff including a child/adolescent psychiatrist, licensed psychologist, pediatrician, pediatric nurse, and nurse case managers to perform the following, highlighting just a few: Consultation to case managers and supervisors regarding medical or behavioral health needs and concerns, including psychotropic medications and alternatives; Peer-to-peer consultations regarding treatment plans; Telehealth psychiatric services, as needed, in identified areas of the state based on quality and capacity issues; Consultation to professionals involved with supporting children in care, in person or via telehealth; Facilitate coordination of care with local physicians or providers, including specialists, for children in CD custody; and An array of services involving oversight, monitoring, consultations, development of strategic/action plans, and analytic reporting products for the foster child population. More information about The Center for Excellence, the services covered by the contract, and protocol for its use will be released in a future memo once an implementation date is finalized.

If there are smokers in the resource home, the plan to protect foster youth from secondhand smoke exposure is to be included in the Home Assessment. A PowerPoint, Protecting Foster Youth from Secondhand Smoke Exposure, is to be viewed by all resource parents prior to licensure or approval to provide foster care services. There are currently eighteen states that require foster homes to be smoke free through legislation and policy . The following conditions have been linked to secondhand smoke exposure in children : SIDS More respiratory infections such as bronchitis and pneumonia More severe and frequent asthma attacks Ear infections Chronic cough Tooth decay Long term effects including Poor lung development Lung cancer Heart disease Cataracts Missouri law tasks the Children’s Division with placing youth in the division’s care and custody, in homes that safeguard and promote their present and continuing good health and in homes that will not commit any act or engage in any conduct that would be injurious to the child’s health. A new training to educate resource providers about exposure to secondhand smoke is now required. The PowerPoint presentation, Protecting Foster Youth from Secondhand Smoke Exposure is self-taught and is located on the Children’s Division’s Foster Parent Information Internet page. All new resource applicants for providing foster care services must complete the training prior to licensure or approval. Currently licensed and approved resource providers may complete the training and receive a one hour inservice training credit using code V113, Secondhand Smoke Exposure. The Notification of Hazards (CD-101) has been revised to include a checkbox to indicate which household members are smokers. Currently licensed and approved resource providers who smoke or have any individual living in the home who smokes will need to complete the CD-101 at time of renewal. If any household member is a smoker, the plan to protect foster youth from secondhand smoke exposure is to be discussed. Refer the family to the required pre-service video, Protecting Foster Youth from Secondhand Smoke Exposure.

The HIPAA Privacy Rule is a federal rule designed to protect individuals’ medical records and other personal health information. In the course of business, the Children’s Division (CD) receives, discloses and utilizes Protected Health Information of employees and clients for a variety of reasons. Employees should exercise care at all times to discuss confidential, sensitive, or personal health information in a manner or place where the discussion is not able to be easily overheard. Measures should be taken to ensure that health information is not accessible to anyone other than the authorized personnel. CD staff will maintain privacy, confidentiality and integrity with regard to protected health information as required by state and federal laws, rules and regulations and professional ethics. Employees found to be in violation of this policy may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal as well as prosecution in a court of law. Required HIPAA documents are located on Children’s Division E-forms. The informational PowerPoint and Video presented by Children’s Division Privacy Officers in 2003 is located in Training Resources on CD Intranet page.

Information in the Resource Provider Case File The purpose of a resource provider case file is to contain required information for the licensure process and subsequently the information necessary to maintain and renew the license. There are several sections of the Child Welfare Manual that a resource licensing worker must use and follow when opening and developing a resource provider case file during the initial licensure/assessment process: Recording Guidelines, 5.1.6 Record Access Out-of-Home Care Provider Records, 5.2.6 Resource Provider Training – STARS, 6.2 Resource Family Assessment and Licensing Process Foster/ Kinship Assessment, 6.3.1 Guide for Conducting Foster/ Kinship Assessments, 6.3 attachment A Foster/Kinship Family Assessment Recording Outline, 6.3 Attachment C Children's Service Worker Responsibilities, 6.3 attachment M The Recording Guidelines and Record Composition section of the Child Welfare Manual identifies all the documents that are required to be present in the resource provider case file. Resource provider case files are available to the public under Missouri's Sunshine Law, Chapter 610, RSMo. Results of a File Review A recent review of resource provider case files identified trends of information and documents contained in a resource provider's case file contrary to policy. Staff must be diligent to adhere to the policy guidelines. The following are some of the identified trends: Use current revision of agency forms Forms are updated frequently for format issues and revised in response to Continuous Quality Improvement requests and legislative changes. Always check E- forms and Desk Top forms for the most current version of forms. This ensures that the most recent requirement for requested information is obtained. Only place documents in the file which are required in policy for that section. No documents shall be placed in the case file that are not specified in policy as a requirement for licensure, maintaining of licensure, and licensure renewal. Some documents may be obtained or viewed in order to complete the home assessment but should not be maintained in the record. Items that should not be in the case file, except in adverse action cases as outlined later in this memorandum, include, but are not limited to, the following items which were observed in the case file review: Directions to the home, including MapQuest print outs. Copies of Social Security cards, birth certificates, school diplomas, car titles, driver's licenses, and STARS/Spaulding homework. Bank account numbers, bank account statements, tax filing forms. The Financial Worksheet provided in the STARS curriculum Step 6 is the worksheet to be used to determine stable finances and money management. However, the worksheet is a part of the STARS homework and is not to be kept in the file. Child-specific information including court orders and the Child Assessment and Service Plan, CS-1 Outdated Vendor Licensure/Placement Resource Form, SS-60 Outdated fingerprint results There are many documents that may be viewed by the resource licensing worker in completing the assessment and reassessment; however, only the documents found in the Recording Guidelines and Composition section of the manual should be placed in the file. Denial and Revocation If during the licensure or re licensure process it is determined that the award of a foster care license is to be denied or revoked, all supporting documentation for the adverse action shall be retained for utilization during the fair hearing process should the resource provider grieve the decision including those documents outlined in this memorandum to be removed. This documentation shall be placed in the Administrative section of the resource provider case record. The decision to deny or revoke a foster care license must be based on non-compliance and or incompetency’s with statute and licensing rules. Training Section Upon approving and entering the license in the system, CD staff are to return all the homework pages that were completed to fulfill the STARS/Spaulding pre-service training requirements to the resource provider. There will be one training section in the file labeled “Training Section”. Documents that are to be placed in the Training Section include: All training certificates All training sign-sheets Training Record Screens Resource Family In-Service Training Request, CD-114 All flyers and notifications of in-service training opportunities It is imperative to include all the above listed documents in the training section in order to verify notification of available trainings and actual training hours earned by the resource provider. Additional Clarifications The Weapon Statement Agreement is obsolete. The language that referred to such a form has been removed from the manual. Weapon storage and safety is addressed on the Resource Home and Safety Checklist, CS-45, section C number 15. However, if there is a Weapon Statement Agreement currently in the file, do not remove it. File it in the forms section of the file. Language in the manual has been revised for consistency to reflect that the Professional Family Development Plan, CD-100, is to be reviewed quarterly, annually, and at the time of license renewal. Council on Accreditation requires that the resource provider home have a plan of action in the case of an emergency and/or disaster. There is to be a section in the resource provider case file under a red cover sheet titled Emergency/Disaster Plan. Content for this section is outlined in memo CD06-33 . An additional background check requirement for resource provider applicants is the Alternative Care Vendor Licensure History Inquiry, ZVLH, screen and Kinship Licensure Type History Inquiry, ZVKH, screen. Checking these screens will determine if the resource provider has applied for and/or were issued foster care license(s) in Missouri in the past. When doing the background checks, it is imperative to place in the file the print out pages for case.net and the sex offender list by address including those indicating no match was found. Implementation All new resource provider case records shall be opened as outlined in this memorandum. The following steps are to be taken to implement the revision of policy presented in this memorandum for currently open resource provider case records: Workers are to take the resource provider case record to a quarterly home visit. Workers are to present to the resource provider the policy update regarding the contents of the provider’s file. Workers are to review the resource provider’s file with the provider and remove the contents that are not required to be in the file per this memorandum. Workers shall return personal documents and copies of personal documents that are removed from the file to the resource provider. Compliance with the requirements of resource provider case record contents as discussed in this memorandum shall be completed prior to October 20, 2010.

The purpose of the act is to protect children from sexual exploitation, violent crime, prevent child abuse and child pornography, to promote Internet safety, and to honor the memory of Adam Walsh and other child crime victims. Since the Act was signed into federal law, the Children’s Division has made changes such as FBI fingerprint checks on Resource homes and checking the Sex Offender Registry to be in compliance with this Act. An additional background check is now to be implemented to further comply with the Adam Walsh Act and to ensure the safety of the children placed in the Division’s care and custody. As part of the licensing process, staff will now expand the CA/N background checks on each household member 17 years of age and older to include each state they have resided in since the age of 17. The search can be conducted by accessing the Department of Social Services 50 states web site or the Family Support Division’s Public Human Services Agency Directory web site. Staff will click on each appropriate state to obtain contact information for verifying any child abuse/neglect history for each household member 17 years of age and older for each state they resided in since 17 years of age. To further enhance a comprehensive C/AN background check, resource/licensing staff also need to enter the residence address of the resource home on the State Highway Patrol’s sexual offender list located on the Missouri Highway Patrol ’s website.

The CS-20 is being changed from the Foster/Relative Home Action Report to the Resource Home Adverse Action Report.  This change is to better reflect the purpose of this form which is to make recommendations for adverse actions to any of our resource family homes – foster, relative, kinship and adoptive. The Notification of Resource Home Adverse Action letter is to be utilized when such an action is being recommended to a licensed or approved home or to an application for resource home licensure or adoptive home approval.  An adverse action would be any denial, involuntary suspension or revocation of a resource home license, adoptive home approval, or application for licensure or approval.  The Notification of Resource Home Adverse Action letter was developed to provide a consistent means of notifying an applicant or resource provider of the adverse action recommended and the appeal process available to them. Staff are to begin using the new CS-20a effective with the date of this memorandum.  The letter is available online at http://www.dss.mo.gov/cd/info/forms/index.htm.  A copy should be retained in the provider’s files in the Correspondence Section. Resource family closed files are to be maintained ten (10) years from the date of last closing; withdrawn applications shall also be kept for 10 years from date of withdrawal.  However, resource home revocation and denial information will be retained at the local level indefinitely.  This is necessary to support any decisions we have made that come into question at a later date through sources such as the Family Care Safety Registry (FCSR).  This information will be kept in the Administrative Section of the licensing record until the record is due for expungement.  At that time, CS-20, CS-20a and any supporting documentation will be placed in a separate administrative file which is to be maintained in the local office indefinitely.

CLARIFICATION OF PRE-SERVICE AND IN-SERVICE TRAINING FOR PLACEMENT PROVIDERS,Missouri,Memo,"2024, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008, 2007","Contact and directory information, Definitions, Foster parent licensing, Kinship","REGIONAL EXECUTIVE STAFF, CIRCUIT MANAGERS, AND CHILDREN’S DIVISION STAFF","PAULA NEESE, DIRECTOR","DISCUSSION: This memorandum will clarify the definition of pre-service and in-service training for placement providers, as well as training provided by staff, contracted providers, or other agencies. The new Foster Home Licensing Rules went into effect on January 30, 2007. Information on all of the changes to the Foster Home Licensing Rules was provided in memorandum CD07-36 . One addition to the rules is the requirement for in-service training hours. The rules now in effect require each foster parent to complete a prescribed number of training hours as approved by the Children’s Division (CD). The current requirement is 15 hours per year or 30 hours per licensing period (except Career foster parents who are required to complete 16 hours per year or 32 hours per licensing period.) The newly revised Foster Parent Bill of Rights and Responsibilities (RSMo 210.566) states “the Children's Division and its contractors shall provide foster parents with regularly scheduled opportunities for pre-service training and pertinent in-service training, as determined by the Missouri State Foster Care and Adoption Advisory Board.” Section 1 Chapter 3 of the Child Welfare Manual states that placement resources have the right to have and participate in pre-service training and continuing education for their role as placement providers. PRE-SERVICE TRAINING Foster Home Licensing Rules require that each adult with parenting responsibilities successfully complete a competency-based training approved by the licensing agency prior to licensure. The required pre-service training curriculum for CD is STARS (Specialized Training, Assessment, Resources, Support and Skills). This requirement also applies to relative and kinship caregivers. The pre-service training currently provided to relative and kinship caregivers is STARS for the Caregiver Who Knows the Child. The caregiver training can be provided as either a self-study or in a group setting. Foster and kinship providers desiring to adopt must attend an additional training prior to being approved as an adoptive resource. This training is known as STARS , Making the Commitment to Adoption (also known as Spaulding) pre-service training. Relatives considering adoption are encouraged to complete the Spaulding training, but it is not required. STARS and Spaulding are co-taught by a professional staff member of the agency or contracted provider and an experienced and contracted teaching foster parent. The STARS curriculum is not specifically named in the new licensing rules so that CD may consider training from other states as a way to meet the requirement. This will allow CD to consider licensure of foster parents who move to Missouri from other states if their prior training meets the competency based requirement. The code to be utilized when entering the Pre-Service training of these foster homes is V099 “Other Approved Pre-Service Training”. Further information on the acceptance of non-STARS pre-service training will be forthcoming. IN-SERVICE TRAINING In-service training is a requirement for continued foster parent licensure and must be completed at the time of re-licensure. Foster care, relative and kinship providers are required to receive and participate in in-service training every licensure period. Relative and kinship care providers may choose not to attend in-service training but should be encouraged to do so. If these providers do not obtain the required in-service hours, they are not eligible to receive the $100 Professional Parenting payment. The process for working with foster homes who do not meet the requirement for in-service hours can be located in the Child Welfare Manual, Section 6 Chapter 3 Attachment D. In-service training can be obtained from the following sources: STARS In-Service training modules are available and completion of a specific module should be based on the identified need in the Professional Family Development Plan. The modules are now available on DVD also. Staff may access the DVDs through supervisory channels; Local training resources which are developed within their own community; Other approved in-service training (must have prior approval by the Regional office if the placement provider is requesting the CD cover the cost or if they are requesting the hours be counted toward meeting training requirements). Other approved in-service training should be flexible and competency based. Competency takes into account the person’s knowledge, skill, willingness, and ability to practice and perform the desired parenting to meet the needs of the children in our care. Flexibility can be allowed for training to occur in various formats such as, but not limited to, small or large group sessions, individual study, readings, coaching, web trainings, conferences, college courses, etc. Staff should consult with their Regional office to determine hours of “other approved in-service training” and if the training addresses the competencies required in agency policy. CHILD WELFARE MANUAL Section 6 Chapter 2 Resource Provider Training – STARS has been updated. The information contained in 6.2 Attachment A: STARS Training Objectives, 6.2 Attachment B: Pre-Service and In-Service Training, STARS Competencies; 6.2 Attachment C: Foster Parent Training; and 6.2 Attachment D: Guidelines for Award of Credit for NonAgency Training are now subsections incorporated into Section 6 Chapter 2. The terminology of Non-Agency Training previously used in the Child Welfare manual is now referred to as “Other Approved In-Service Training”. SS-60 B FORM, CODE SHEET, AND INSTRUCTIONS The SS-60B has been updated and is now available online. The SS-60B code sheet previously had terminology regarding “outside training” on codes V199, V299, V399, V499, V799, V899, and V999. The terminology for these codes has now been updated to “Other Approved In-Service Training”. The code V099 is being added for “Other Approved Pre-Service Training”. All training is either preservice or in-service. Staff should begin using the new code sheet immediately. The SS-60B Instructions and form have also been updated.

Governor Holden signed House Bill 1453 into law on June 29, 2004, known and sited as the ""Dominic James Memorial Foster Care Reform Act of 2004"". This legislation revises statutes related to child protection and foster care. The changes outlined in this memorandum become effective August 28, 2004. Bill Section Title/Subject Changes in Missouri Statute Manual Section 37.710 Office of the Child Advocate for Child Protection and Services Allows the Office of Child Advocate to have access to specified information about children in protective custody, reports of child abuse and neglect, and records concerning protective services for children. 5.2 Attach B 2.4 Attach D 135.327 Adoption Tax Credit Beginning July 1, 2004, 50% of tax credits allowed shall be for special needs children who are residents of Missouri at the time the adoption is initiated. Tax credits not to exceed four million dollars in any year. If in the first 90 days less than two million dollars is issued for children who are not residents of Missouri, the remainder shall be made available for residents of Missouri. (See Adoptions Tax Credit Log and Adoption Tax Credit Power Point) 4.30 attach F 167.020 Homeless Child or Youth Modifies the term “homeless child or youth” to include children and youth under age 21 who: • are sharing housing with others, living in motels, hotels, or emergency shelters, or who are awaiting foster care placement; • who have a primary nighttime residence that is not designed for regular sleeping accommodations; • are living in cars, public spaces, abandoned buildings, or 4.21.8 7 Glossary 192.016 453.060.5 453.061 Putative Father Registry DHSS shall establish a Putative Father Registry.

Children’s Service workers will instruct all alleged minor parents (LS1) in the care and custody of the Division about their responsibilities and encourage fathers to sign up on the Putative Father Registry. Any man who has engaged in sexual intercourse with a woman is deemed to be on notice that a child may be conceived and as a result is entitled to notice of an adoption proceeding. The pamphlet which describes the putative father registry can be ordered from the warehouse CSE-6 (It should be noted that this pamphlet is in the process of being enhanced according to provisions of1453) POLICY IMPACT No Policy Changes 207.085 CD Employee Dismissal Employees of the Children’s Division, including supervisory personnel and private contractors, involved with child protective services, who purposely, knowingly, and willingly violate a policy, rule, or state law related to CA/N activities of the division must be dismissed if the violation results in serious physical injury or death. Caseload size in excess of standards established by the Council on Accreditation for Families and Children’s Services will be a mitigating factor in determining dismissal. This revision is not a significant change from current DSS policy regarding grounds for employee dismissal. HRC Administrative Manual currently under revision 210 Preponderance of Evidence This law changes the standard of proof for Child Abuse and Neglect Investigations received on or after August 28, 2004, from “probable cause” to “preponderance of the evidence”. Several references throughout Chapter 210 are made to our Child Welfare Manual in relation to this change in standard- of- proof as well as changes in the, but this does not represent a significant change in practice. Investigations should continue to be conducted with an emphasis on: • thorough collection and documentation of evidence; • an accurate account of interviews (verbal and non-verbal) • descriptive, observable and behaviorally specific documentation of actions and conduct relative to the investigation; • descriptive, observable documentation regarding the physical condition of children and environment; • investigative findings based on all available facts and evidence that is of greater weight or more convincing than the evidence offered in opposition to it.

Staff will utilize resources available, such as Federal Parent Locator Services (FPLS) through the Family Support Division and Office of the State Court Administrator. POLICY IMPACT 4.4 Attach A 7 Glossary 210.145.5 Interviewing Child in School The Division may not meet with child at any school or childcare facility building where the abuse of the child is alleged to have occurred. If alleged abuse occurred in school/child-care facility, staff shall not meet with the child in same school/child-care facility. If abuse occurred in school/child-care facility, arrangements need to be made to meet with the child in a different locale. This is a correction from the 2003 legislation in House Bill 613, which did not allow CD staff to meet with a child in any school or daycare facility. (Refer to Memorandum CD04-69) See CD04-69 Policy Changes 210.145.11 FSTM Invitees Dictates who must be invited to family support team meetings, which include parents, legal counsel for the parents, foster parents, the legal guardian for the child, the GAL, and the CASA shall be provided notice of the meeting.

SHIVELY, DIRECTOR","DISCUSSION: The purpose of this memorandum is to introduce policy revision regarding transracial parenting training. Memo CS00-18 introduced the Transracial Parenting Project in June, 2000. The North American Council on Adoptable Children (NACAC) developed the project consisting of three components; a Self Awareness Tool, Training Curriculum, and Parenting Resource Manual. Since that time additional training curriculums have been published. Children’s Division policy no longer specifies the Transracial Parenting Project as the sole training resource to meet the need of providing training and support to those resource parents who wish to explore whether fostering or adopting a child of a different culture is appropriate for their family. The training curriculum should include but is not limited to: Information that highlights the important issues involved in caring for a child of another race, culture, or ethnicity. Including but not limited to identity development, family issues, community resources Information to educate parents on what it truly means to parent a child (ren) of a different race, culture, or ethnicity Strategies to help parents explore ways to prepare for parenting a child (ren) of a different race, culture, or ethnicity The expectation is that the training facilitator will have experience in parenting a child of a different culture. This could enrich the quality of the discussion, answer unmet needs of those currently parenting, and encourage the development of support groups. In-service training credit for up to six (6) hours may be earned with submission of documentation that transracial parenting training was completed.

The Foster Family Profile was first introduced in the Code of State Regulations. The profile will provide the Family Support Team (FST) with a more comprehensive picture of the foster family, allowing for a better matching process when determining placement for foster youth. These policy changes will bring the Child Welfare Manual in compliance with 13 CSR 35-60.030. The Foster Family Profile cover letter (CD-55) is now available to provide the potential resource provider with an explanation of the purpose of the Foster Family Profile (CD-56). Having the Foster Family Profile available to the Children’s Service Worker (CSW) and the FST will enable them to utilize the form when making placement decisions that are in the best interest of the child. Existing Resource Providers Existing resource providers are to complete the Foster Family Profile at the time of license renewal. The CSW is to provide the resource provider with the Foster Family Profile cover letter (CD-55) and the Foster Family Profile (CD-56) for completion during this time. Resource providers are to return the form to their local licensing worker within no more than ten business days. The profile should then be updated by the foster parents as needed with subsequent household changes. New Resource Providers At the first in-home family consultation meeting the CSW should provide the applicant with the Foster Family Profile cover letter (CD-55) and the Foster Family Profile (CD-56) for completion. The applicant is to return the completed CD-56 to the local licensing worker within 10 business days. The CD-56 is required as a part of concluding the home study process and is to be received prior to scheduling the last in-home consultation. The completed CD-56 and a photograph of the resource provider’s family are to be under separate cover sheet (to be developed locally) and placed in the front of the resource provider’s record. Utilization of the Foster Family Profile The CSW should assess and review the Foster Family Profiles of potential resource providers as a part of the process of selecting a placement for the child. When the CSW is meeting with the FST to discuss placement changes for a child, the Foster Family Profiles of possible resource providers are to be available for the FST to review. The FST is to utilize the information in the profiles in making its determination and selection of a placement for a child or sibling group. A thorough review of potential resource providers will assist the FST in selecting an appropriate placement that can meet the needs and serve in the best interest of the child. Documentation and Maintenance The CSW should document in the initial recording that the applicant was provided and given a brief overview of the Foster Family cover letter (CD-55), and the Foster Family Profile (CD-56). In regards to subsequent recordings, the CSW should document discussions regarding the Foster Family Profile. The CD-56 is to be updated when there are changes in the household composition that impact the information gathered on the form. The most recent CD-56 with a recent photograph of the family attached is to be kept in the front of the Resource Provider record. The obsolete CD-56 should be placed in the Family Assessment Section of the resource provider record, with a notation on the front page of the profile identifying it as obsolete.

ADOPTION RECORDS DISCLOSURE,Missouri,Memo,"2024, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020","Administrative process, Adoption, Child rights, Definitions, Legal process, Termination of parental rights",CHILDREN’S DIVISION AND CONTRACTED STAFF,"DAVID WOOD, DIRECTOR","DISCUSSION: The purpose of this memo is to inform staff of a legislative action regarding disclosure of adoption records which will be effective on August 28, 2020. Section 453.121 RSMo has been amended by House Bill 1414. The terms “identifying information”, “lineal descendant” and “non-identifying information” have been amended and/or redefined by this legislation: “Identifying information” is now defined as individually identifying information for or about a unique individual, including information likely to disclose the contact information, location, or identity of such individual. “ “Lineal descendant” is now defined in Section 472.010 RSMo. “Non-identifying information” is now defined as information that is not identifying information. The most significant change made by this legislation is the mandate to release all information to an adult adoptee if the adult adoptee’s biological parent had their parental rights terminated through a nonconsensual or involuntary termination of parental rights proceeding. This addition means adult adoptees who register with the adoption information registry or petition the court for release of information will have access to all information, including identifying information about the biological parent, but only if parental rights were terminated involuntarily. If the parental rights were terminated voluntarily, current policy regarding disclosure of identifying information pertaining to the adopted adult's biological parents still applies. As part of the effort to prepare biological parents for termination of parental rights, it is essential that parents be informed of their rights on issues related to the release of their information. Staff have a duty to explain that this law allows identifying information is to be shared with adult adoptees when termination of parental rights occurred because of an involuntary or nonconsensual termination proceeding. Biological parents, who are voluntarily terminating their parental rights, are to be informed of the process, outlined in the law, to file an affidavit with the court, which allows or prohibits release of identifying information to an adult adoptee or their lineal descendants. As a part of adoption planning, adoptive parents and youth, if age appropriate, are to be made aware of the adopted child’s rights at age 18 to obtain information about their biological parents. Adoptive parents are to be made aware of the right of their adopted youth to register with the Missouri Adoption Information Registry at age 18 and are to be provided the Registry brochure.

The “Bank of Questions” resource allows for more in-depth case consultations and enhances critical thinking by turning questions into conversations. The “Bank of Questions” resource is a result of Strategy 3.2 in the Program Improvement Plan (PIP). The Children’s Division recognizes the importance and critical nature of front-line supervision to successful outcomes for children and families. Supervision is a key component to effective work and supervisors are instrumental in helping team members understand and incorporate the integrated practice model in their work with children and families. The “Bank of Questions” resource is designed to help supervisors coach their team to be able to gather crucial information, synthesize that information, and to guide people through a change process.

Housing Services and Coordinated Entry System,Missouri,Memo,"2024, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020","Aging out of the foster system, Exit from care",CHILDREN’S DIVISION AND CONTRACTED STAFF,"REGINALD MCELHANNON, INTERIM DIRECTOR","DISCUSSION: The purpose of this memorandum is to introduce the Coordinated Entry System (CES) as a service to connect families and older youth with housing resources. This memo also introduces Children’s Division’s commitment to the Governor’s Committee to End Homelessness (GCEH) discharge policy. Research indicates that housing instability and homelessness significantly contribute to parental stress and increase the risk factors associated with child abuse and neglect. Research also indicates that older youth who transition out of foster care are at heightened risk of housing instability and homelessness due to a limited number of personal permanent connections, trauma experience, and limited access to resources after experiencing foster care. The CES is Missouri’s primary resource to connect people to housing services by providing Access Points across the state with the primary goal of providing services, no matter where or how people present. This resource allows staff to connect youth and families to Missouri’s array of housing services with one referral to an Access Point. A listing of Coordinated Entry Access Points by region and county can be found here. All Access Point agencies will complete a pre-screening tool with clients and connect them with the appropriate level of housing services. More detail about Missouri’s Coordinated Entry System can be found here . Although the CES can be utilized on behalf of any family or youth served by CD at any point of involvement, a referral should be made when housing stability is the primary barrier to successful AC case closure. The Child Welfare Manual has been updated to include instructions about when to apply this policy and how to document efforts to secure permanent housing. As part of membership on the GCEH, CD partners with community, state and federal organizations to follow the guiding principles and procedures of the GCEH discharge policy when serving families and older youth who are experiencing homelessness or at risk for homelessness. This means that CD will continue to engage families and older youth in their discharge planning, integrate community resources to reduce duplication of services, and collaborate with community partners to achieve effective discharge planning during the course of case management.

YOUTH BANK ACCOUNTS,Missouri,Memo,"2024, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019",Services while in care - Financial,CHILDREN’S DIVISION AND CONTRACTED STAFF,"DAVID B. KURT, DIRECTOR","DISCUSSION The purpose of this memorandum is to introduce the state legislative requirements and new case management practices concerning youth bank accounts. In 2018 the state legislature passed Section 431.056, RSMo., which states that, “A minor who is sixteen years of age or older and who is in the legal custody of the children's division, pursuant to an order of a court of competent jurisdiction shall be qualified and competent to contract for the opening of a checking or savings bank account with the consent of the children's division or the juvenile court. The minor shall be responsible for paying all banking related costs associated with the checking or savings account and shall be liable for any and all penalties should he or she violate a banking agreement. No state department, foster parent, or entity providing case management of children on behalf of a department shall be responsible for paying any bank fees nor liable for any and all penalties related to violation of a CCS SB 819 44 banking agreement.” This statute and related policy enhances the implementation of the ""Reasonable and Prudent Parent Standard,” to reduce the systemic barriers which keep youth from participating in enrichment and skill development opportunities comparable to their peers who are not in care. Because youth in legal custody of the Children’s Division experience challenges in developing long term supportive relationships with trusted adults, they are less likely to have an appropriate co-signer when opening a bank account. The experience of managing a bank account when youth begin working or handling their own money is an important developmental experience which can help prepare them for independence as adults.

MCELHANNON, INTERIM DIRECTOR","DISCUSSION: The purpose of this memorandum is to inform staff of changes to the placement hierarchy and diligent search requirements. These changes come in response to HB 397 , which became law on August 28, 2019. This change will enhance the safety network of children and provide more opportunities for them to stay connected to family members. This bill made into law the mandate that the Children’s Division make diligent efforts to locate adult siblings and parents of siblings of children who enter foster care. This law also establishes that adult siblings and parents of siblings are next in priority, after the non-offending parents and grandparents, for placement of a child in foster care. Finally, the law establishes that the definition of sibling as: one of two or more individuals who have one or both parents in common through blood, marriage, or adoption, including siblings as defined by the child's tribal code or custom. The Placement Hierarchy document has been updated on e-forms to reflect these changes (link below).

FOSTER CARE MAINTENANCE PAYMENTS FOR ELIGIBLE YOUTH PLACED WITH A PARENT IN A LICENSED RESIDENTIAL FAMILY BASED TREATMENT FACILITY FOR SUBSTANCE USE,Missouri,Memo,"2024, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019","Services while in care - Financial, Use of federal money (including Title IV-E)",CHILDREN’S DIVISION AND CONTRACTED STAFF,"DAVID KURT, DIRECTOR","Missouri Children’s Division plans to begin claiming title IV-E foster care maintenance payments for eligible youth placed with a parent in a licensed residential family based treatment facility for substance abuse disorder in accordance with requirements in sections 472(j) and 472(a)2(C) of the Family First Prevention Services Act (FFPSA). Family Self Help Center, also known as Lafayette House in Joplin Missouri, is currently the only substance use disorder treatment facility that meets all of the FFPSA requirements to qualify for maintenance payments for youth in CD custody when they are physically placed with a parent at the facility. Family Self Help Center is a Women’s and Children’s CSTAR (Comprehensive Substance Treatment and Rehabilitation) facility licensed and contracted with Department of Mental Health. Missouri Women’s and Children’s CSTAR providers provide and arrange for individual and family counseling, parenting skills and training, and parent education as required by FFPSA. Family Self Help Center also meets the “Trauma Informed” criteria required by FFPSA. To qualify for maintenance payments, the recommendation for placement at Family Self Help Center must be agreed up by the Family Support Team and documented in the child's case plan before the placement. The recommendation should be documented initially in a Contact Note and then on the Child Assessment and Service Plan (CS-1). Placement with a parent at Family Self Help Center can only be considered for the following eligible youth: Eligibility: Eligible youth have been physically removed from a home pursuant to a court order. A “legal” or “constructive” removal is acceptable. There must be a judicial determination signed by a judge stating that remaining in the home would be contrary to the child’s welfare or that out of home placement would be in the child’s best interest. This determination must be made in the very first court order that authorizes the removal of the child from the home, regardless of whether there is an emergency or a non-emergency. If the judicial determination is not made in the very first court order pertaining to removal, the child will not be Title IV-E eligible for the duration of the child’s stay in foster care; A judicial determination of reasonable efforts to prevent a child’s removal from the home or a statement that reasonable efforts are not required must be specified in a court order and must be made no later than 60 days from the date the child is removed from the home. If the judicial determination is not made timely the child’s foster care maintenance payments will not be eligible for Title IV-E reimbursement for the duration of the child’s stay in foster care; For tracking and payment purposes and to implement this opportunity for families more quickly, CD will initially track placement of eligible youth by using placement type “CTO” on the placement screen in FACES, which is currently used for non-licensed court ordered facilities. The name of the facility must be entered with address, telephone number and residence county as follows: Family Self Help Center PO Box 1765 Joplin, MO 64804 Jasper County Once the case managing office receives an invoice from Family Self Help Center, payment should be made directly to Family Self Help Center. CD staff will use the FACES Financial Management Payment Request process to pay using Vendor number 001418559 , program area “AC” with “MM” Vendor type. The Service Code is “MAIN”. The maintenance rates CD currently uses to pay vendors that are not licensed by CD will be used to pay qualified SUD (Substance Use Disorder) treatment facilities as illustrated in the table below: Standard Payment Rate for Family Based Residential Vendors Type of Expenditure Age Limitation Amount Payable 1. Maintenance for Children placed with Parent in SUD Family Based Residential facility licensed by the Department of Mental Health 0-5 years 6-12 years 13 and over $300.00 $356.00 $396.00 2. Infant Allowance 0-3 years $50.00 A FACES systems change has been requested; a new placement code of “ FBR ” (Family Based Residential) will be created and will eventually replace the use of the CTO placement code for these types of placements. Staff will be alerted when the FBR placement code is available for use. The FBR code will allow the FACES system to track these placements once FBR is implemented and used. Currently Family Self Help Center is the only facility that meets the requirements of the Family First Prevention Services Act for reimbursement. Staff will be alerted when additional SUD treatment facilities meet the FFPSA qualifications to receive maintenance payments for youth in CD custody placed with a parent in residential SUD treatment.

"MO :: Section 4, Chapter 2 (Placements), Subsection 11 – ICPC :: 2.11 Intro",Missouri,Rules,"2024, 2023, 2022",Placement,,,"This sub-section describes procedures and protocols when seeking to place a child in another state or when another state wishes to place a child in Missouri. There are five interstate compacts, which impact the placement of children across state lines.  They are: Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC) Interstate Compact on Adoption and Medical Assistance (ICAMA) Interstate Compact on Juveniles (ICJ) and Interstate Compact on Mental Health (ICMH). Interstate Compact of Educational Opportunity for Military Children (ICEOMC) The two Compacts, which primarily impact the Children’s Division, are ICPC and ICAMA. The Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC) is a legally binding contract among member states approved by the U.S. Congress and the legislatures of all 50 states, District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands as uniform law. The law governing ICPC in Missouri is found in Section 210.620, RSMo. ICPC assures the protection of children crossing state lines and ensures they receive the same supports and services as if they remained in their own state. The Compact establishes orderly procedures for placements and outlines the responsibility of each state. The Interstate Compact of Adoption and Medical Assistance (ICAMA) requires states to provide Medicaid (Title XIX) to eligible children with an adoption subsidy agreement, when that child’s family moves between member states. Currently, all states except Vermont and Wyoming are members of ICAMA. The territories of the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico are also nonmembers. The law governing ICAMA is found in Sections 453.500 & 453.503, RSMo. The other two compacts: ICJ is under the Department of Youth Services; ICMH is under the Department of Mental Health and the ICEOMC is administered and managed by a compact commissioner appointed by the Governor. Type of Placements Governed By the ICPC The ICPC applies when children are to be placed in the following settings: Interstate adoptive placements; Interstate placement for care into relative or kinship placements, foster homes, group homes, and/or residential treatment; Interstate placement with parents and relatives when there is court jurisdiction; or Interstate placement of adjudicated delinquents only when placement is sought for residential treatment. Type of Placements Exempt From the ICPC The compact does not apply when placement is sought under any of the following circumstances: Interstate placement from birth parent to birth parent, when there is no court jurisdiction ; Interstate placement from birth parent to relative (as defined in RSMo 210.620 Article VIII), when there is no court jurisdiction ; Interstate placement from legal guardian to birth parent or relative, when there is no court jurisdiction ; Interstate placement to a medical or psychiatric hospital; Interstate placement to an educational program (Job Corp, college, etc.); Interstate placement of adjudicated delinquents unless placement is sought for residential treatment (see above); Divorce/custody assessments; International adoptions when the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has issued an IR-3 visa (adopted in the child’s country of origin); Placement of a child into/or out of Canada, Puerto Rico, Guam/American Samoa or any other foreign country; or Children under court jurisdiction visiting a relative/parent for 30 days or less. Anything over 30 days is considered a placement and would be subject to ICPC . Prior to making an ICPC referral: The Children’s Service Worker must contact the proposed caretaker, to determine whether they are interested in providing for the child before making a formal ICPC request. The Children’s Service Worker will use the CD-ICPC-104 to document this contact. If it is the plan to make a maintenance payment to the resource when the placement is approved, a foster home study should be requested regardless of the degree of relationship.

"MO :: Section 6, Chapter 18 (Resource Providers Approved to Provide Elevated Needs Foster Care Services), Subsection 3 Elevated Needs Level B Foster Care, – Sub-subsection 6 (Youth with Elevated Needs-Level B Resource Provider Employment)",Missouri,Rules,2023,"Administrative process, Foster parent licensing, Reporting requirements",,,"The Level B resource provider(s) are the primary change agents for a child in Level B Foster Care. Responsibilities include immediate response to any problem experienced by the child at home, school, or in the community. The resource provider(s) are further required to arrange and transport the youth to all medical, dental, therapy appointments, visitations, to provide the child with opportunities for the recreation and social activities, to attend staffing and treatment planning meetings for the youth, to work with biological parent/kin and to maintain detailed and accurate reports of significant events involving the child. The scope of these responsibilities combined with the multi-level needs of the Youth with Elevated Needs-Level B youth adds up to a full-time job for the primary resource provider caregiver. Accordingly, full-time employment outside the home by the primary Level B resource provider is not recommended by Division policy. There may however, be individual situations where part-time employment for the primary Level B resource provider would be reasonable for that home and family. It is also possible on rare occasions that the unique circumstances in a given family would warrant a formal exception to full time employment. (Example could include a Level B home with a trained relative living close by, a teacher’s aide working in the same school as the child(ren) or a family recruited for one specific child.) Submission of Plan for Employment For consistency and assurance of good practice, all primary Level B resource parents caregivers interested in working should submit to their local case manager a thorough, complete plan for meeting the needs of the child while at work. The plan is reviewed at the local level and then forwarded to the Regional Director or designee for a decision. This process would apply to potential Level B resource parents where the primary Level B resource parent is already working and to approved families where the primary Level B resource parent desires to work. The request and plan should include the following information: Description of the job and work schedule; How the Level B resource parent(s) will be available 24-hours a day for immediate crisis response to the school, home and/or community; Where the child would be during the hours worked and who will be providing care for the child; Who will be transporting the child and providing support for the child during visits with parents and kin, counseling and medical appointment, recreation, social activities and other activities when the career parent is unavailable; How the Level B Resource Parent(s) will participate in all staffing and treatment planning meetings; How the Level B Resource Parent(s) will provide treatment and support to the biological parents; and If Level B youth are now in the home, the potential impact on those youth. Factors for Regional Director Decisions Decision by Regional Director or designee would take into account the following information: If Level B youth are in the home, consult with local county staff, case managers and Family Support Team (FST) as to best interests of the youth If not currently a Level B home, or home has no youth in placement, consult with local county staff and licensing staff, Review number of foster youth currently in the Level B home and/or the number of children desired in future (for example, a potential Level B home recruited specifically for a child who will be the only foster youth in the home); and Assess all aspects of the plan, including the identified supports in place, consistency of care for the youth, and overall feasibility. After review and assessment of plan, the Regional Director or designee would make decision and notify the local Division office and the Level B Resource Parent. Updates of the Level B Resource Plan All Level B Resource Parents approved for work have the responsibility to notify Children’s Division (CD) of any changes in their employment. Significant changes in hours worked, support systems available, and impact on availability would require submission of a new request to the Regional Director or designee. Level B Resource Parents approved for work shall update their plan for work to their Circuit Manager on an annual basis.

The Children’s Service Worker will also assess the youth’s overall treatment needs, including educational and emotional needs and will obtain evaluations if needed. The worker will develop a treatment plan with the Family Support Team (FST) for stabilizing their behavior, to improve their level of functioning at home, school and in the community and to achieve permanency . Resource parents are the primary change agents for youth placed in their care. Clinical intervention should be limited to support and guidance to the resource parents. However, on a case-by-case basis, other therapeutic support may be added for the youth based on that particular situation as recommended by the team working with the youth. (For example: participation in an incest survivor’s group or family therapy with the family of origin). The Children’s Service Worker will provide at least weekly consultation to the resource parent, with a minimum of one consultation per month occurring in the home. At that time the worker will: Assess and monitor the youth’s progress toward treatment and permanency goals; Assess and monitor the resource parent’s job performance; Review and discuss reports maintained by the resource parent; Arrange regularly scheduled respite care; Maintain 24-hour availability to the resource parents to assist them with any emergency; and Assess the level of care required by the youth at 90-day intervals and move the youth to a less restrictive environment as appropriate. The Children’s Service Worker will provide the resource parent a written assessment of their job performance at 90-day intervals. Services to the birth parent will be consistent with the case plan. The Children’s Service Worker will: Assess and monitor their progress and keep them informed of their youth’s progress and provide services consistent with the permanency goal; Assist them in following through on treatment strategies used by the resource parents when the youth is in their home; and Encourage and nurture a relationship between the resource parent and the birth parents, kin and/or adoptive parent(s). The Case Manager will submit reports of the youth’s progress to the FST and submit reports to the court at required intervals. The court reports should incorporate progress reports and the Child Assessment and Service Plan, CS-1, including FST recommendations. Periodic Reviews The goal for youth who qualify for the youth with elevated needs program is to stabilize their behavior, to help them function in a less restrictive environment and to achieve permanency. Elevated Needs Level B care IS NOT permanency but is designed to be a stepping stone for the youth to obtain a permanent home.   As these youth do have a variety of special needs, the goal of successful permanency can be challenging. Accordingly, resource parents, staff, and other treatment team members must aggressively pursue permanency and use periodic reviews as one of the tools to assure progress toward permanency is occurring. To assist youth in achieving a permanent home, it is important that the resource parent and the team tailor the level of intensity and intervention to their needs as youth achieve progress and success. The dilemma for the teams may be how to move the youth to the appropriate level of intervention, such as Level A or traditional foster care, without moving the youth from the current resource home. Ideally, youth who improve in Level B care and are ready for less intensive care could move directly to their permanent home. When that is not possible, the next best solution is to keep the youth in the same resource home under the category of Level A, traditional foster care (depending on the youth’s needs) or pre-adoptive home. Youth who are happy in their resource home and are experiencing success should not be moved to a different resource home solely due to no longer needing Level B intervention. Staff, resource parents and the team members must assess each individual situation carefully and negotiate an outcome that is in that youth’s best interests. As noted, the periodic reviews are a critical tool for assuring the youth’s level of intervention is matching their needs and that permanency is on target. As always, the best interest of the youth is the guiding principal with these complex decisions. Situations where there is disagreement among team members as to continuing need for intervention and/or the appropriate plan for the youth should be referred to the Regional Director or designee for consultation. Periodic Review schedule Six (6) months – Multi-disciplinary Selection/Screening team that originally recommended placement with the resource parents and/or the Family Support Team. The team will continue to review youth’s situation every 6 months on an on-going basis. The FST may conduct a six-month review only if the team includes representatives of the required disciplines/agencies for Selection/Screening team. Also, FST team members must allow for adequate time for an in-depth assessment of the youth’s progress, behaviors, and treatment plan. Twelve (12) months reviews – Regional Office Review Team conducts a review based on local team review information. Regional Office Reviews are a critical tool in assuring consistency, accountability and progress with the Level B program. Also, Level B Foster Care status does not exclude youth and families from compliance with ASFA timelines. Termination of Elevated Needs Classification Permanency planning shall continue throughout the Level B placement. Seek a less restrictive setting, once the youth’s presenting problems have been replaced with appropriate coping behaviors. It may be necessary to involve a Children’s Service Specialist for consultation if the team is unable to reach a consensus regarding termination of the youth’s classification. Post-placement options include: Return to birth parents; Placement with a relative provider; Adoption; Return to traditional resource home, or level A resource home; Independent living; Retention in the current home; or Other out-of-home care. The Screening Team should meet with the Children’s Service Worker, resource parents, youth’s therapist (if applicable), and birth parents to review, collaborate, and determine the appropriate status and step down (graduation) of the youth. The parties should involve a Children’s Service Specialist or Regional Designee for mediation if the parties are unable to reach a consensus regarding termination of the youth’s status. The Children’s Service Worker should provide ongoing support and assistance to the youth’s caregiver and the referring Children’s Service Worker following the termination of the placement. When discussing post-placement options, staff should keep in mind that Youth with Elevated Needs-Level B do not qualify for adoption subsidy.

"MO :: Section 4, Chapter 2 (Placements), Subsection 5 – Mental Health Hospital Placements :: 2.5 – Mental Health Hospital Placements",Missouri,Rules,"2023, 2022, 2021","Administrative process, Placement, Services while in care - Mental Health",,,"Occasionally, it may be necessary to place a child who is in the custody of the Children’s Division into an acute mental health hospital setting.  Such a placement should be limited to situations where a child is in crisis and needs the safety monitoring, assessment, and treatment services that only an inpatient psychiatric hospital setting can provide.  MO HealthNet provides payment based on the number of days certified as medically necessary, while Children’s Division is financially responsible for any additional days through discharge. Criteria for Placement The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry provides the following basic guidelines for psychiatric hospital admission: The child has a psychiatric disorder which is of such severity as to cause significant impairment of daily functioning in at least two (2) important areas of his/her life, i.e., school performance, social interactions, or family relationships; The treatment proposed is relevant to the problems diagnosed and adjudged likely to benefit the child; and Other available less restrictive treatment resources must have been considered and determined to be not available or not appropriate to the child’s needs or have been attempted and proven unsuccessful. If a child is in psychiatric crisis, or in cases where the child has already been hospitalized, the Children’s Service Worker should consult with appropriate supervisory staff immediately to determine if the child is a potential candidate for psychiatric hospitalization. Placement and Service Delivery MO HealthNet provides payment for inpatient days certified as medically necessary by its review authority, Conduent.  Children’s Division is financially responsible for any days the child remains in the hospital beyond the certified medically necessary length of stay days. It is necessary to monitor and evaluate the placement of children in a private psychiatric hospital.  To do so effectively, the following procedures have been developed: Begin working on the child’s discharge plan at the onset of placement, ensuring the child moves within the number of days certified by the MHD review authority, Conduent, unless the Regional Director or RCST approves an extension (see next section); Request the hospital provide, in writing, a treatment plan, diagnosis, and the expected length of stay within three (3) calendar days of admittance; Notify the Regional Director, in writing, of the placement, including the reasons for this type of placement, expected length of stay, and discharge plan, if known; If long-term residential treatment services (RTS) are anticipated, make a residential referral through FACES for the RCST within three (3) days of placement. The referral should include the following: Form CS-9; A list of specifically identified and described problems; A list of specifically identified strengths; Placement history including date child entered CD custody and number and type of previous placements; Current social/family history; Current IEP and/or other appropriate educational records; Current medical evaluation and other appropriate medical records; Current psychological evaluation and counseling reports; and Any other appropriate information (including hospital admission summary and diagnoses). If the child is in need of an inpatient extension beyond the days originally certified as medically necessary, inquire if the hospital has contacted Conduent to request additional days be certified.  Any additional days certified as medically necessary will be reimbursed by MO HealthNet. Length of Stay Exceeds Number of Days Certified as Medically Necessary MO HealthNet provides payment to enrolled providers for inpatient days certified as medically necessary by its review authority, Conduent.  Children’s Division is financially responsible for any days the child remains in the hospital beyond the certified medically necessary length of stay days. Approval for extension beyond the number of days certified as medically necessary shall only be authorized by the Regional Director or RCST, depending on the anticipated discharge plan.  As soon as it appears a stay beyond the number of days certified as medically necessary is needed, the Children’s Service Worker shall request approval for an extension: From the Regional Director for a child moving into a resource home placement within the community upon discharge, or From the RCST for a child being referred for residential treatment upon discharge. The following information should be included in the request for extension: Child’s name and DCN; Current placement/facility; Explanation of the continued need for stay at the psychiatric facility; Description of the efforts made to secure an alternate placement; and Copy of the hospital’s diagnosis and recommended treatment upon discharge. The Regional Director or RCST shall notify the Children’s Service Worker of the decision regarding approval for the child to remain in the facility prior to expiration of the maximum number of days certified by Conduent. It is the responsibility of the Regional Director or RCST to provide the hospital with written authorization to allow the child to remain in the hospital beyond the number of days certified by Conduent as medically necessary.  The written authorization must clearly state that CD is responsible for payment beyond the medically necessary length of stay days. The hospital should invoice the county office for any inpatient days beyond those certified as medically necessary: For a child discharged from the hospital to a resource home placement within the community, a Payment Request should be submitted through approval levels to DFAS for reimbursement. For a child with a plan to enter residential treatment upon discharge, the invoice should be submitted to the RCST who will facilitate a Child-Specific Contract for payment.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/mo-section-4-chapter-2-placements-subsection-5-mental-health-hospital-placements-25-mental

The hospital staff may request the approval of a case manager for the child’s participation in the study. A request could involve emergent/life-threatening or non-emergent situations. Procedures for staff are as follows: Emergent Make an immediate referral of this matter to your supervisor, who should then take it up the chain of command to the level of field support manager or regional director or FCCM program manager. Share with your supervisors any pertinent information you might have regarding the child’s medical history or treatment history that might help them make an informed decision regarding the use of the investigational treatment. The field support manager or regional director or FCCM Program manager will then evaluate the situation and make a determination, based on policy and existing protocols regarding medical treatment of children in the custody of the state. (Note that you may be asked to convene emergency family support team meetings or work with your local court to expedite decisions that might impact the child’s safety and well-being. Please follow the directives of your supervisors in regard to this matter.) FCCM Directors should notify Regional Directors of decision made and reasons why. Non-Emergent Obtain clear information about the study from research applicant so you have facts to present to others regarding the study and this child’s participation. Evaluate any possible harm that could come to this child from participation in the study. Evaluate the benefits of the child’s participation in the study – focusing primarily on the benefits to the child or his/her family and secondarily on benefits to the division. Consult with your supervisor regarding his/her feelings on the harm or benefits of the child’s participation. If time allows, present the request for the child’s participation to the Family Support Team at the earliest possible date. The FST’s decision regarding the child’s participation should be the final decision. If time does not permit the presentation to the FST, consult with the juvenile office, the guardian ad litem and, if TPR has not occurred, the child’s parent(s) regarding the child’s participation. The decision of the professionals and the parents should be the final decision.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/mo-section-8-chapter-3-research-protections-and-data-requests-subsection-1-research-1

The following should be considered prior to authorizing services under this contract: All children with an open foster care or adoption case must use a Medicaid provider for any type of behavioral health services. This includes individual and family counseling, testing and assessment, etc. If a non-Medicaid provider serves the client(s), a bill that includes CPT (current procedural terminology) codes must be submitted with the payment request. The CPT codes will be used to determine the amount that Medicaid would have paid. This is the maximum amount that will be paid for that service. Adult clients are not eligible for counseling under straight Medicaid. If they do belong to a Managed Care plan, they are eligible for counseling services, but only through the plan network. Staff should be sure to explore all these options before authorizing counseling through CTS. If counseling services are court ordered, workers still MUST use either a Medicaid provider or a provider who has a CTS contract to provide the specific service needed. Most court orders do not specify which provider is to be used. If a provider is used who does not have a CTS contract, payment will be denied or reduced to the current rate paid under Medicaid. The client receiving the counseling must have active/open CA/N, case management, or adoption involvement with the Division. Therapeutic Services include the following: Assessment: The assessment is usually the first stage of a treatment process, but mental health assessments may also be used for other varying purposes. The assessment includes social and biographical information, direct observations, and data from specifically administered tests. An assessment is most commonly carried out for clinical and therapeutic purposes, to establish a diagnosis and formulation of the individual’s needs, to plan the individual’s care and treatment. Assessments may be performed in an in-patient, out-patient, or community setting. Specialized Clinical Assessment/Psycho-Sexual Evaluation: This is a specialized clinical assessment of adult and juvenile sex offenders, which are also referred to as a psycho-sexual evaluation. These assessments are generally performed by a psychiatrist or a psychologist; however may be performed by a Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC).       Psycho-Sexual Evaluations are generally court ordered and may be utilized for either an adult or juvenile sex offender (client) where the court is trying to determine any of the following: Risk of repeat behavior; Interventions; Specific risk factors; Client’s willingness to participate in recommended treatments and/or interventions; Identifying factors that may prevent engagement in treatment and/or interventions; or Identifying strengths and protective factors Psycho-Sexual Evaluations may be used by judges and/or other parties to make informed decisions regarding the following: Pre-sentencing in Adult or Juvenile Criminal Court; Custody disputes in Family Court; or Child Protection Cases Psycho-Sexual Evaluations shall not be used to determine the following: Guilt or innocence; Whether or not a client is a sex offender; or Whether or not a client meets the profile of a sex offender. Behavioral Health Services: Behavioral Health Services is a clinical and/or therapeutic service provided to a client to meet their behavioral health needs which exceed the maximum allowable units provided by MO HealthNet. Behavioral Health Services are intended to help the child acquire functional skills in their community placement, to prevent hospitalization or placement disruption. The service is intended to address serious behavioral concerns including severe aggression and self-injury that traditional therapeutic techniques have been unsuccessful in treating. Behavioral Health Services may include but not be limited to: Creating a behavior support plan, including the collection and analysis of data related to the child’s behavior. Behavioral modification strategies to assist the child and family (teaching/modeling); Development of coping strategies aimed at keeping the child in the foster/relative/kinship or adoptive/guardianship home; and, Development of appropriate communication skills between the child and the parent/guardian. Crisis Intervention: Crisis intervention may be provided to a client in order to alleviate or diffuse a situation of immediate crisis. The situation must be of significant severity to pose an imminent threat to the client’s well-being or of such severity that the client poses a danger to others. Crisis intervention may be accessed when a family crisis is occurring which may result in child maltreatment. Family Therapy: The focus of this service is to correct family dysfunction so that the children of the family may remain in their home rather than being placed in alternative care or, if in placement, be reunited with the family. The service should be of limited duration, generally three (3) to six (6) months. Services shall include group therapy with the family, with the child present, as authorized, and occasional individual therapy sessions if recommended, including structured interaction led by the provider, communication exercises, role playing, task assignment and analysis, and parenting skills training. Group Therapy: This service is group therapy in the form of guidance and instruction through therapeutic interaction between the provider and a group consisting of at least three (3) but no more than ten (10) individuals, who are not all members of the same family. Individual Therapy: Individual Therapy is an intensive level of client specific therapeutic treatment services. Th focus of individual therapy is to correct client dysfunction so that the children of the family may remain in their home rather than being placed in alternative care or, if in placement, be reunited with the family. Speech Therapy: Speech Therapy is for clients who have speech, language or hearing impairments. The client’s need for this therapy must be determined in a speech/language evaluation conducted by a certified audiologist or a state certified speech therapist. Speech/language therapy (ST) is the evaluation and provision of treatment for the remediation and development of age appropriate speech, expressive and receptive languages, oral motor and communication skills. Speech therapy includes activities that stimulate and facilitate the use of effective communication skills. Speech/language therapy includes treatment in one or more of the following areas: articulation, language development, oral motor/feeding, auditory rehabilitation, voice disorders, and augmentative communication modes. Speech Therapy is a client specific treatment modality. Testing: Testing services include the administration and interpretation of an individual battery of one or more psychological/psychiatric tests appropriate to the needs of the client, the submission of a written report that includes the test results, a professionally appropriate analysis and interpretation of the result of the tests, and a recommendation for treatment. Though often performed directly following the completion of a mental health assessment, psychological/psychiatric testing services may be provided in lieu of or in addition to previously completed mental health assessments as warranted on a case specific basis. Testing services are often utilized to rule various mental health/personality disorders in or out and/or to reach a diagnostic determination. Vision Therapy: Vision Therapy is an individualized, supervised, treatment program designed to correct visual-motor and/or perceptual cognitive deficiencies. Vision Therapy sessions include procedures designed to enhance the brain’s ability to control: Eye alignment; Eye teaming; Eye focusing abilities; Eye movements; and Visual processing. Visual-motor skills and endurance are developed through the use of specialized computer and optical devices, including therapeutic lenses, prisms and filters. During the final stages of Vision Therapy, the clients newly acquired visual skills are reinforced and made automatic through repetition and by integration with motor and cognitive skills.

The information received from Level One through Level Three of the grievance process is collected in the Service Delivery Grievance Database and may be aggregated for use in the CQI process. Circuit Managers or Regional Designees, Regional Directors or his/her designee, and the Division Director or his/her designee are responsible for making sure that all Service Delivery Grievance Form information is entered into the Service Delivery Grievance Database at each of their perspective levels in a timely manner.  Reports generated from the Service Delivery Grievance Database are available for discussion during CQI group meetings or may be accessed for the purposes of identifying grievance trends or gaps in service delivery, locally, or statewide. The ultimate goal is to use the information gained from the process to continually build upon our quality service delivery system. Each team that reviews the reports should look for trends related to the quality of services being delivered, program issues, communication, etc. that led to the grievances.  If trends are identified, it is expected that an action plan is developed to remedy the identified area of concern.  Steps that are taken to rectify any of the identified issues should be reported to the next level CQI team and followed-up at the next quarter local team meeting to monitor progress.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/mo-section-8-chapter-1-grievance-and-appeals-subsection-1-service-delivery-grievance-5

This does not include foster youth. The registry is maintained by the Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS). It will search the following systems: CA/N records (findings of ”Preponderance of Evidence” court adjudicated”, or prior to August 28, 2004, “Probable Cause“ findings), Employee Disqualification List, maintained by the Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS), Child-care facility licensing records maintained by DHSS, Residential living facility and nursing home records, maintained by DHSS, Employee Disqualification Registry maintained by Department of Mental Health; Foster parent licensing records, maintained by the Children’s Division (CD); and Sex Offender Registry information maintained by the Missouri State Highway Patrol (MSHP). The resource development worker will provide the applicant with instructions regarding the process for each adult in the household to register with the FCSR on the Internet. Instruct the applicant to register as quickly as possible. The worker may assist the applicant with the on-line registration If no social security card is available, the only acceptable substitute is a driver’s license (if the SSN is used as the ID number); a military ID; a MO HealtlhNet card; or the Social Security Administration (SSA) statement provided when application is made for a replacement card (as long as it has the SSN identified, the name appears on the statement and it is initialed or signed by a SSA representative). An exception can be made for families who do not have Social Security numbers due to their religious practices (i.e. Amish). They are not required to register with the FCSR. However, a note regarding this should be documented in their record and home assessment. Registrants (and all their adult household members) who are resource parents, respite providers, or are applying to provide those services must check the foster parent box in Section A to avoid having to pay the registration fee. The resource development worker may telephone the FCSR at 1-866-422-6872 to make a background screening request. Generally information will be available within two weeks. An oral report will be given at the time of the call and will be followed with a written report to both the requestor and the registrant within 48 hours. Registration with the FCSR is only required once. When completing a background screening for re-licensure, the resource development worker can do one of the following: Access the FCSR on-line with the assigned ID and password (preferred), or Call the FCSR at 1-866-422-6872 The resource development worker obtains on-line access to the FCSR by doing the following: Go to the FCSR home page, www.dhss.mo.gov/fcsr ; Click on the Forms link; Click on the How to Become a FCSR Internet User link; Click on the Internet Background Screening Access/Security Request. Return the completed document by Fax to 573-522-6981, or by mail to: DHSS/Family Care Safety Registry PO Box 570 Jefferson City, MO 65102 In response the FCSR will assign a USER ID number to the resource development worker to be used exclusively for access to the FCSR. The USER ID and instructions on how to do the password and how to run a background screening will be faxed to the worker. This ID and password are autonomous from the worker’s current ID and passwords used for logging on to the state computer system, FACES and PROD. The password is on a 30-day expiration cycle and the worker will have to update it every thirty (30) days.

If there is a need to complete a Purpose Code “X” screening for emergency placement or exigent circumstances, staff should adhere to the following process: The Children’s Division worker or juvenile officer must request local law enforcement to search the Missouri Uniform Law Enforcement System (MULES) for anyone 17 years old or older residing in the household. MULES is an electronic communication system strictly used for law enforcement purposes, but permission has been granted to allow the Division access to the information in cases of emergency protective custody, where children are placed in the care and custody of CD. In accordance with Section 210.482.2 RSMo, a child should be immediately removed from the home in which he/she has been placed if anyone 17 years old or older refuses to provide fingerprints. The FBI has approved law enforcement to conduct Purpose Code “X” background screenings with a time-limited delay in fingerprinting due to placing a child as a result of an emergency situation. However, fingerprints must be submitted to the FBI within 15 days of the MULES check. To meet that deadline, the agency worker must provide the placement provider with information to schedule their screening with the contracted electronic fingerprint vendor. The fingerprint authorization letter, CD26-f, shall be provided with the correct registration number for the circuit entered in the place indicated on the letter. When a court or Children’s Division approaches a law enforcement agency about providing this type of check, the law enforcement agency is not responsible for ensuring the legitimacy of the request. Law enforcement is required to ensure the requestor is an authorized representative, and upon verification, the inquiry should be performed. Local offices should work with their multidisciplinary teams to establish protocols to fulfill the required verification process. Local offices shall document and maintain the Purpose Code X Request log, CD-153. If the Children’s Division fails to keep an accurate and up to date log to account for subsequent delayed fingerprinting, or a reason that fingerprints will not be submitted (e.g., due to a disqualifying criminal history), the Division could lose the right to delay fingerprinting in the future. MULES inquiries are highly restrictive and should not be shared outside of the Children’s Division or juvenile office; they are not even to be disseminated to the applicant of record.

After an applicant and adult household members have registered in MACHS and fingerprinted, if the individual has a reportable, printable arrest, the individuals who are approved as the OCA administrator and readers for the OCA registration code that the individual was printed under will receive an email notification from MSHP. Within 24 business hours of receiving the notification from MSHP, the OCA Administrator/Circuit Manager will access MACHS and select “click to request” the report. Only the administrator has access to request the report. Once the report is loaded then the Administrator or the Read Only staff may access the report. The Rap Back report is reviewed for further action based on the information provided in the report. It may take more than a day for the report to download. Failure to download the record within 30 days of the alert will result in the MSHP automatically unsubscribing the applicant and the applicant will have to be printed again. The report must be printed and placed in the background section of the file with the original fingerprint report. The paper copy of the original fingerprint and any Rap Back reports are kept indefinitely in the file until the file is closed. Fingerprint report and Rap Back reports must not be uploaded into FACES. The Circuit Manager will notify the resource licensing worker as identified in FACES for the applicant or other household member within 24 hours of viewing the report. Within 24 hours of notice, the resource licensing worker will make contact with the individual identified in the Rap Back report and assess the situation. The worker will immediately contact his/her supervisor and Circuit Manger to report regarding the situation so determination may be made regarding further action such as a call to the hotline, removal of children and/or placing the home on administrative hold to determine if there are grounds to revoke the license/approval. When a resource home license or approval is closed, the Circuit Manager must immediately unsubscribe the applicant or adult household member from the Rap Back program data base. Resource providers are required by regulation to notify the Children’s Division or contractor of any change in household composition 2 weeks prior to the change. When a household member age 17 and older permanently moves away from the home, the Circuit Manager must immediately unsubscribe the household member from the Rap Back program data base. Failure to remove a person who is no longer a placement provider or adult household member from the Rap Back program is a compliance error with the MSHP. Unsubscribing an individual removes them from the MACHS system. Each person who is unsubscribed from Rap Back will have to be fingerprinted again if they return to being a resource provider or living in a resource provider’s home.

It is the responsibility of the resource development worker to explain the registration process. The worker may assist the applicant with registration process in MACHS. The electronic scan method is the preferred method of obtaining criminal background checks. The card and ink method will still be available in special circumstances; however, staff should be aware that this method will result in delays in receiving the criminal history. No one may be licensed or have their license renewed until criminal background results have been received. The Missouri State Highway Patrol public window is not an option for having fingerprints completed. Staff should not refer applicants or providers to the Highway Patrol to have prints completed. The Division cannot pay for criminal background checks completed on biological parents or for court ordered studies on private adoptions and guardianships. The resource development worker will provide authorization letter CD26-b to those individuals who must pay for their fingerprinting. The completed reports are posted on the MSHP’s Missouri Automated Criminal history System (MACHS) Internet page. The correct local office or private agency developing the resource is determined by the Registration Number. The registration number is associated with a specific OCA code. The MSHP response is received first. After the FBI has completed its search, any results will be forwarded to the MSHP, who will posts the results on their MACHS page.

All felony and serious misdemeanor arrests including sexual offender registration information as defined under 589.400, RSMo, and All alcohol and drug related traffic offenses are considered reportable criminal offenses. Except for the specific felony history listed below, a criminal history, child abuse and neglect history, or other review information does not automatically preclude licensure. Staff should determine the relevance of all such findings to child caring responsibilities, and should seek guidance from supervisors. A supervisor must review and evaluate the background information if there is a record of conviction (other than those listed below) and or child abuse and if the decision is to approve the home assessment. The supervisor’s review and decision to approve or disapprove must be documented. Felony Convictions Staff may not approve the application of any person in which a record check reveals that the individual pled guilty or was found guilty of a felony for child abuse or neglect, spousal abuse, domestic violence, a crime against children (including child pornography), or a crime involving violence, including rape, sexual assault, homicide but not including  other physical assault or battery was determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. Staff may also not approve the application of any person who has had a court of competent jurisdiction determine a felony conviction for physical assault, battery, or a drug-related offense within the last five years. Household members age 17 and older shall disclose criminal history. Consideration shall be made of felony cases where the individual pled guilty, is found guilty and /or convicted of a criminal offense or pled guilty but instead received a suspended imposition of sentence (SIS). In the unlikely event it is determined the best interest of a child would be served by placement in an unlicensed home, and a court of law has ordered the child placed in the unlicensed home, written approval must be obtained through supervisory lines to the Regional Director. The Regional Director must review the request and, if in agreement, forward with their recommendation to the Deputy Director for Children’s Division for final consideration. Written requests should include a thorough description of the applicant’s situation and why it would be in the child’s best interest to be placed in an unlicensed home. If approved by the Deputy Director, IV-E funding may not be used and the worker will be responsible for notifying the Eligibility Specialist who will ensure that state only funds are used. If a resource parent commits a felony act as listed previously in this section which results in a conviction or the resource parent admits to committing the act and receives a suspended imposition of sentence (SIS ) federal funds may not be used for foster care maintenance or adoption assistance payments if any of the aforementioned conditions exist. It is imperative that in those circumstances the worker notifies the Eligibility Specialist who will enter the correct fund code for state only funding. BSIU maintains a log of all criminal background checks completed on resource providers and applicants. Per FBI guidelines, FBI reports can be released to local county offices and made available in court. FBI reports cannot be released to contractors or to private entities. If a contractor has requested the information to complete an assessment, they are not allowed access to the report. The Children’s Division will convey to the contractor one of the following: The report is clear; proceed with the assessment, or The report revealed something that must be explored. The contractor will then be requested to refer the family to the local Children’s Division office before continuing the assessment. Local office staff will then meet with the applicant and determine whether the applicant will be allowed to proceed with the application. If the applicant is selected out, the local office staff must inform the family in writing and notify the contractor.

Youth eligible for elevated needs should have more than one presenting problem as described in Chapter 14.6. The Selection/Screening Team should also determine that the youth is in need of a higher level of care for the youth to be deemed eligible for the program. The Screening Team may recommend: The youth is not appropriate for the program; The youth is appropriate, but a compatible home is not available in the county of origin or nearby counties; or The youth is appropriate, and there is a compatible home. The licensing worker will share all referral information with the prospective resource parents and assess with them their ability to meet the youth’s needs. The Children’s Service Worker will notify the referring worker/case manager regarding acceptance of the youth into the program. The case manager/Children’s Service Worker will receive an oral and written decision from the Screening/Selection Team liaison, including the identification of a potential resource home. The written recommendation from the Selection/Screening Team should be documented on the referral form. If the youth does not qualify for the program, the team should indicate such on the referral form. The Children’s Service Worker will then carry out any of the following actions, as appropriate to the youth being placed: Coordinate all planning with the service county, if the county of current placement is different from the case manager county: Receive notification when a resource becomes available; and Notify the licensing worker in writing if the placement is no longer needed. The Children’s Service Worker shall receive notification of the date of the pre-placement visit(s). The pre-placement visits are vital to a successful placement and should not be rushed. Furthermore, the Children’s Service Worker will share a thorough description of the potential Level B resource family with the youth and assess his/her interest in them. Assess the Level B resource family’s commitment to the permanency goal and, as appropriate, willingness to work with birth parent(s), relatives, and potential adoptive resource. Transportation for the youth to/from the pre-placement visits needs to be assured. Level B Resource Parents may be reimbursed via a payment request for transportation costs of pre-placement activities. The actual number of visits is governed by the needs of the youth and the Level B resource family. A minimum of one (1) in-home, overnight pre-placement visit is required. An assessment period where the youth is removed from the home must follow every pre-placement visit. A Level B resource parent may receive a prorated maintenance payment, via a payment request, on a per diem basis for lengthy pre-placement visits, even though the youth remains officially with another caregiver. The Children’s Service Worker must gain commitment from both the youth and resource family and then proceed with the placement. The worker will assure the youth’s arrival at the resource home when all parties agree the child is ready. Update the Alternative Care Client Information Screen in FACES. When the permanency goal is reunification with relatives and/or kin, introduce the family and the Level B resource provider as early in the process as possible to increase family involvement and promote a family/Level B resource provider relationship. A Level B resource parent may not care for more than four (4) youth with a maximum of two (2) who are qualified for Level B care simultaneously.

These needs may include, but are not limited to, illness, death in the family, hospitalization, or imminent risk of removal of the child where “time out” would stabilize the placement. Respite care should not be used for regular child care purposes. Respite care for children in specialized foster care, such as youth with elevated needs foster homes, will be provided per the respective program guidelines. Licensed resource providers must notify the worker or their supervisor in their county of residence prior to using respite care. Together with the licensed resource provider, the worker will assess the appropriateness of the selected respite care provider for the child(ren). Caution should be exercised when using currently licensed homes and facilities to assure that license capacities are not exceeded and the provider is able to adequately supervise all children in their care. If the child is identified in FACES to be in a youth with elevated needs- Level A placement, another trained Level A resource provider must be used for respite services. The worker must determine the balance of respite care units available to the licensed resource parent. This will be done on the Respite Unit Tracking Log, CD-113.

Information sharing and receiving is essential for the respite provider to know how the child is being parented. Individuals who demonstrate positive and effective parenting skills Understand loss, grief and attachment issues Required training for respite providers includes information on these topics Individuals who demonstrate ability to protect and nurture children Individuals who present to be flexible with their time and availability Respite providers must be flexible and prepared for unexpected emotional, medical and/or behavioral problems with the children, of which the foster parent may not yet be aware Individuals who demonstrate the ability to work as a member of a professional team Individuals who demonstrate the ability to follow rules and guidelines Disclosure by the selected individual of their motivation for providing respite services Applicants for respite provider positions must be carefully screened about their motivations for providing respite. Some applicants may be interested in working with children in foster care because of their own personal experiences with foster care or with abusive or neglectful situations. While these experiences may sensitize the applicant to the trauma the children may be experiencing, they must be screened to ensure that they have processed any unresolved feelings. Potential providers need to understand that each child’s experience is unique and cannot be compared to their own. Individuals who demonstrate the ability to meet the developmental needs of the children Individuals who demonstrate the ability to cooperate with Children’s Division or private agency staff Information resource parents may want to share with a provider: Sensitivities your child has to touch, teasing, sound, and light How your child best communicates with others Calming activities that soothe your child Past abuse experiences that may be triggered by specific activities; how to avoid such situations, and strategies for providers if your child becomes upset Your child’s fears How you respond to your child’s behaviors Some questions respite providers may want to ask resource parents: What are four important things I should know about your child? Does your child have special routines and schedules? What are your child’s likes and dislikes? What are the expectations at bedtime? When is bedtime? Are there special routines? Does the child wake up, sleep walk, and wander at night? Does the child wet the bed? How do you handle these issues? Does your child require special food preparation or have any food allergies? Is your child safe alone? Does your child play well with other children? Can your child be outside? Will your child wander? For best practice in using respite, remember these: Have a scheduled pre-placement visit whenever possible. This makes the respite more “comfortable” for everyone involved. Use the same respite provider whenever possible. Consistency will be best for the child. Give ample notice to your worker for approving respite and in helping you locate respite for you. Your worker can also assist you in locating a respite provider. When you have agreed to provide respite care—make it a commitment! Be Prepared!!

"MO :: Section 6, Chapter 17 (Respite), Subsection 1, – (Respite) :: 17.1 Respite Care",Missouri,Rules,2023,Services while in care - Other,,,"Respite care is the provision of periodic and/or intermittent, temporary substitute care of children who are in the care and custody of the Children’s Division (CD), placed in a licensed resource home (foster, relative or emergency). Respite care services may be approved as part of an adoption or guardianship agreement. The Respite plan should serve equally the needs of both the foster youth and the foster caregivers. Respite is designed to provide relief for the resource provider from the stresses of the constant responsibilities of providing out-of-home care. The time the foster youth takes a break from the resource family should include planned opportunities for social activities and enrichment. Respite is a fun and rewarding time for foster youth while their placement providers are allowed to relax and have time to themselves for recharging. Respite is not for use in regular child supervision situations when a parent would normally use ordinary child care, i.e., hiring a baby-sitter for an afternoon or evening outing, or for attending foster parent training or seminars. Refer to Subsection 10 of this chapter for supervision options. Respite care may be planned in advance or used in emergency situations. Respite care may be provided to licensed resource providers a minimum of 6 hours, daily, overnight or on a weekly basis. Respite care should be used to maintain stable placements, but should not be used to exclude foster children from ordinary and traditional family activities. Using respite is important to reduce placement disruptions and to support safer and healthier homes.

Determine whether the parent(s) of the foster youth approve of the relative as a potential placement provider. If the placement is with a grandparent, parental approval is not needed per RSMo 210.305; If the placement is with a relative, parental approval is not needed per RSMo 210.565. Determine the relationship of the foster youth to the potential provider. Complete the Resource Home and Safety Checklist, CS-45, to determine that the environment is safe. Prior to placing a child(ren) in a relative resource home that will exceed the capacity limits, workers shall: Assess relative caregivers’ parenting skill level and ability to assure safety for these additional children. Identify all supports and resources needed to meet the needs of the child(ren) and relative caregivers in maintaining safety and stability of the placements. Assess all vulnerabilities of the child(ren) due to age, developmental disabilities, complex medical or behavioral needs, mental health, or other special needs as a result of their trauma history. Consider factors which may impact the capacity of the relative to meet each child’s overall care such as; financial hardship, availability of child care, reliable and available transportation, caregiver health, employment and existing family stressors. Discuss and document in detail each of these factors on the CD-152. The CD-152 is to be sent to Central Office for review and consideration of approval for placement. Approval must be obtained from Central Office prior to placement of any additional children in the home or within 3 business days if emergency placement was approved by a supervisor or above. Central Office will respond to waiver consideration within 3 business days of receipt. Obtain information regarding the potential provider including: name, date and place of birth, Social Security number, address and telephone number. Complete background checks. The CA/N report may be obtained by accessing local county office computers or by calling the Child Abuse/Neglect Hotline. Staff will conduct child abuse and neglect background checks in every state where each household member 17 years of age and older has resided during the past five (5) years per Adam Walsh Protection and Safety Act. The search can be conducted by accessing the List of Contacts for Other States Child Abuse and Neglect Registries . This list includes the contact and the process to make the request for every state. Per Statute 210.482, RSMo, a CA/N and criminal record check shall be completed for all adult household members over the age of 17, or those under the age of 17 who have ever been certified as an adult and been convicted of, or pled guilty or no contest to any crime. The Division will request that a local or state law enforcement agency or juvenile officer immediately conduct a Purpose Code X, name-based criminal history record check to include full orders of protection and outstanding warrants of each person over the age of 17 residing in the home by using the Missouri Uniform Law Enforcement System (MULES) and the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) to access records maintained by the FBI. After the name-based search has been conducted and the foster youth has been placed with the relative family, all household members age 17 and older must submit fingerprints to the Highway Patrol to be used to search the criminal history. The fingerprint authorization letter of Purpose Code X inquiry, CD26-f, shall be provided to the resource provider with the correct registration number for the circuit in the place indicated on the letter. The fingerprints must be obtained within 15 days of the requested name-based check as required for a Purpose Code X inquiry. If the placement is not made, the worker must contact the law enforcement entity that conducted the check and report that the placement was not made. Results of the fingerprint checks will be provided to the Children’s Division office that made the request: Any foster youth placed in a relative home shall be removed immediately if any person residing in the home fails to provide fingerprints after being requested to do so. If the placement of a foster youth is denied as a result of the name-based criminal check, and the denial is contested, the relative provider has 15 business days to submit fingerprints to the Highway Patrol through the Children’s Division. The cost of fingerprinting shall be paid by the state. Check Case.net Check the Missouri State Highway Patrol’s sexual offender list by household address. Enter the address of residence of the resource home at the Missouri State Highway Patrol’s sexual offender list located on the web at: https://www.mshp.dps.missouri.gov/MSHPWeb/PatrolDivisions/CRID/SOR/SORPage.html This search will determine if a sexual offender is registered as residing at the resource home address.

Per RSMo 210.127 the search progress to locate the absent parent must be reported at each court hearing until the parent is either identified and located, or the court excuses further search. The same criterion applies when searching for relatives. Preferably, the foster youth’s initial out-of-home placement will be with a relative foster provider, unless the court has determined that relative placement is contrary to the best interest of the foster youth. If the foster youth is not placed with an identified relative provider, the court must make specific findings on the record detailing why placement with a provider is not in the best interests of the foster youth, Section 210.565.3 . Alternative care staff are responsible for obtaining a list of potential relative providers from the parents/or caregiver. Information gathered on page 4 of the Child/Family Health and Developmental Assessment –Parent Information form, CW103 A, may be utilized for this information. The list of potential relative providers should be obtained as soon as possible and no later than at the 72-hr meeting. This list and efforts to locate the identified relative provider is also to be documented in the assessment and treatment section of the case record and on the Child Assessment and Service Plan, CS-1. When a foster youth is placed in an agency arranged relative placement and the placement provider successfully completes the licensure process, that provider will be eligible to receive a monthly maintenance rate equal to that of the traditional foster care payment rate each month. The parent of the foster youth shall not live in the relative foster family home with the foster youth with the exception of those parents of foster youth who are also in the legal custody of the Children’s Division (CYAC), unless ordered by the court. If a court orders that a parent of the foster youth may remain in the resource home, the parent of the foster youth shall be in compliance with 211.038 RSMo background check results. The resource home will not be eligible for maintenance payments if the foster youth’s parent(s) reside in the resource home. If the resource home was not previously licensed, they will not be eligible for licensure if the foster youth’s parent(s) resides in the resource home.

Examples of the majority include: If a child is in foster care for 6 months during October 1 thru September 30, 4 out of the 6 required visits during that time frame must be in the child’s placement. If a child is in foster care for only 2 months during the Federal Fiscal year, 2 visits must occur in their placement as the majority of the visits are required in that setting. If a child has been placed in a foster home for 5 months, 3 of the visits held with the provider must be in the provider’s home.

These standards should be considered by the Family Support Team (FST) when developing and reviewing the visitation plan. The Children’s Service Worker is responsible for ensuring that a visitation plan for each parent and the child’s siblings is developed and implemented. It is the worker’s responsibility to assure visits are scheduled between the parents/child/sibling(s) according to the plan established by the FST. The roles and responsibilities of the FST should be agreed upon and written in the visitation plan documented in FACES. This can involve contact with the resource provider, treatment resources, relatives, or other party responsible for supervising visitation. When visitation plans are not implemented and/or visits do not occur, the worker shall document such reasons in FACES. A separate plan may be in place to address parental and sibling visitation. However, this does not prevent either visit from occurring on the same day in the same setting. Visitation should never be used as a reward or punishment for either a parent or child. Continued contact between the child and family is essential to maintaining and strengthening family bonds. It is recommended that visits occur weekly, or as frequently as possible, with a minimum of one time per month. When planning activities for siblings, consideration should be given to the children’s ages, developmental needs, schedules and routines, i.e. school. Examples of sibling activities to maintain sibling connections, include but are not limited to the following: sharing child care providers (when possible), joint counseling sessions (if appropriate), working on life books together, sleepovers, celebration of birthdays, holidays, attending school events, writing and calling each other. Sibling visits should occur at least one time per month. Whenever possible, visits should occur in the parental home or in a homelike environment. This may include the home of the resource provider, unless safety of the child, provider or staff is an issue. Opportunities should be provided to allow the parents to participate in their child’s normal day-to-day activities, when possible.  For example a parent could attend parent teacher conferences, extracurricular activities, and doctor’s or dentist appointments. Supervised visitation involves the monitoring of visits to ensure the safety of the child. Supervised visits shall occur when court ordered or if determined by the FST that the parent/sibling is unable to assure the safety of the child. Supervised visitation should be used as an opportunity to assist the parent in enhancing his/her parental skills. If a parent is institutionalized or incarcerated, the worker should contact the institution regarding their visitation policy. Visitation should be scheduled in conjunction with the institution and as agreed upon by the FST. If the court has denied visitation between parents and/or siblings, the treatment plan should address what needs to occur prior to a recommendation to allow visitation. When it has been determined that TPR will occur, and is in the best interest of the child, a closing visit should occur between child and the parent(s), if possible and allowed by the Court. Occasionally, families serving in the military receive Family-Centered Services or their children come into the custody of the Children’s Division. In the event services to a child or family become necessary, staff should be aware of Missouri’s state statutes regarding these families. Section 452.412 RSMo. states “A party’s absence, relocation, or failure to comply with custody and visitation orders shall not, by itself, be sufficient to justify a modification of a custody or visitation order if the reason for the absence, relocation, or failure to comply is the party’s activation to military service and deployment out-of-state.”",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/mo-section-4-chapter-10-case-management-activities-subsection-3-visitation-between-parents-0

A diligent search shall be active, thorough, and timely. The Division is required to immediately begin a diligent search to locate and place a child with a suitable grandparent when a child is placed in protective custody.  Diligent searches are also required for all suitable relatives known to the Children’s Division. Diligent searches and their results should be documented in FACES. A diligent search for other relatives must occur within thirty (30) days from the time the emergency placement is deemed necessary for the child. The Children’s Division must continue to search for suitable relatives for the child’s placement until a suitable relative is identified and located or the court excuses further search. Whenever a court determines that a foster home placement with a child’s relative is appropriate, the Children’s Division must complete a diligent search to locate and notify the child’s grandparents, adult siblings, parents of siblings, and all other relatives of the child’s possible placement. Reasonable efforts must be made to identify and find these individuals throughout the life of the case. Progress made to locate the absent parent must be reported at each court hearing until the parent is identified and located or the court excuses further search. The law requires placement with the non-offending parent, with some exceptions, as long as that parent is entitled to physical custody. The Children’s Service worker should use all sources of information, including the known parent, to attempt to locate any absent parents. When notifying relatives (including adult siblings and parents of siblings), staff should disclose the following: The child has been or is being removed from the parent(s). Staff do not need to go into detail about the reason for removal as any removal related to the parents’ health information is protected The options the relative has according to the law to participate in the care and placement of the child, including any options which may be lost by failing to respond to the notice The requirements to become a resource family home and the additional services and support which are available for children How guardianship could be a possible outcome for the child The Children’s Service Worker, within 30 days of taking protective custody of the child(ren), must identify and notify all grandparents and other adult relatives to determine whether placement would be appropriate and whether support options are available within the child’s family. The case record needs to clearly reflect why they would or would not be a resource to the child(ren). The worker should further assess whether factors that initially ruled out a potential support or family placement option can be remedied and make efforts to do so. The worker must also continue to reexamine any supports or family resources initially ruled out monthly to determine if circumstances have changed A complete and diligent search requires the following: Using all known variations of the parent/relative’s name, search readily available resources, such as: State computer systems including: FACES – staff should complete a Call/Case Prior History search using DCN, Social Security Number, Name and Address if known FAMIS – Staff should complete a Family Assistance Management Information System search by completing a DSS search in FACES. To access the FAMIS screens in FACES, staff should enter the parent/relative’s name, DCN, or social security number on the Call/Case Prior History screen. Staff should select the DSS search button and FAMIS case information will display on the FACES screen. Child Support – Staff should complete a Missouri Automated Child Support System (MACSS) search by completing a DSS search in FACES.

Pursue leads developed in all efforts: Make in-person and/or telephone contacts with family, friends, and neighbors at the parent/relative’s previous addresses; document results of each contact individually and specifically in the case narrative and on the child’s CS-1. Establishing good contact with these people is important in order to gain trust. Although they may not be willing to provide the parent/relative’s location, they may encourage the parent/relative to come forward or provide other useful information in locating the parent/relative. Send “certified, return receipt requested” letters to the previous addresses of individuals not contacted in person. Send blind copies of letters to addresses from which certified letters were returned (optional). Send letters of inquiry to professionals or to agencies within the community which may have had contact with the family.

Workers should complete the Request for Location Services form, CD-88, and submit it to their designated staff. Designated staff should complete their search within 7-10 business days and return the updated form to the Children’s Service Worker. The list of designated staff that can search DMV screens is posted on the CD intranet on each Region’s web page. Social Media (Facebook, etc,) searches can be completed according to local protocols as needed. TLO website can be used by assigned regional personnel to complete searches as needed. The Children’s Service Worker will then complete their search for the parent or relative based on the information provided by the designated staff. Once identified, the worker should contact the individual by means of a certified letter. Due to the confidential nature of a child’s case, no identifying information should be provided in the letter. The letter may state that the individual’s name was provided to our agency as a parent or relative to a child in our custody as a possible placement resource. If the individual responds to the letter, the worker should verify their identity (by age/social security number/date of birth, or other identifying information as documented on the CD-88). Once the individual’s identity has been verified, the child’s identity can be released. If the individual desires to be considered as a placement resource, staff should proceed by completing a background check on the individual as per guidelines in Section 6 of this manual. Document correspondence in detail in FACES and through Document Imaging. Staff may list the absent or non-custodial parent on the custodial parent’s AC case in FACES as a case member and their whereabouts on the Family View screen indicated as out of the home.

"MO :: Section 4, Chapter 10 (Case Management Activities), Subsection 1 – Permanency And Case Planning",Missouri,Rules,"2023, 2022, 2021",Permanency,,,"Permanency Permanency Planning (including concurrent planning) should begin immediately after removal of the child from the home. It is the Division’s responsibility to work with the child and family to gather comprehensive information that allows the establishment of appropriate goals for the case circumstances. This includes engaging in discussion with the parents, establishment of paternity, exploring relative care and working with the child as age appropriate. The initial interactions with the family are imperative in collecting information to develop appropriate permanency plans for the child to meet the child’s needs in a timely way and promote stability. While the Division strives to keep children with their parents if possible, the agency recognizes this is not always the best option for all children. The permanency goal must be established for each child at their 72 hour meeting upon entry to alternative care. If a child’s primary goal is determined to be reunification, a concurrent goal is required and must be established within 30 days of the child entering alternative care. The concurrent goal must be in the child’s best interest, appropriate to meet their needs and attainable. For example, guardianship would not be considered appropriate if the child had no identified resources who could provide this permanency option. To address the child’s need for timely permanency, staff shall continue discussion with the family during case planning interactions to establish an alternate plan for the child should the primary goal prove unattainable. Case planning and permanency discussions, including Family Support Team conversations, with the family should occur throughout the life of the case shall be documented in the case record. The concurrent plan shall be documented in FACES and on the Social Service Plan. The concurrent plan must include placing with relatives unless such placement is contrary to the welfare of the child. If the placement is considered contrary, documentation shall be made in FACES to reflect the determination If relative placement is out of state, a timely referral to the Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children (ICPC) is needed to ensure the process is in place as it may take time to process between states. Decision-making regarding family reunification or other permanency plans is not done solely by the Children’s Service Worker. The worker is to be supported by the Family Support Team, agency supervisors, and other individuals and agencies familiar with the parent and child. Concurrent Permanency Planning Concurrent planning is a process of working towards reunification while at the same time, establishing and implementing an alternative permanency plan for a child. Appropriate establishment of placement for the child to meet the child’s needs is critical to the concurrent plan.  Placement should be thoughtful and consider the child’s goal.  While moves may occur for some children, careful planning and selection of placement may help to minimize disruptions and provide stability. Concurrent rather than sequential planning efforts are utilized to more quickly move a child from the uncertainty of foster care to the security of a safe and stable permanent placement. Concurrent planning should include steps to place the child for adoption, guardianship, or in another approved permanent placement, including youth with a goal of Another Permanent Planned Living Arrangement. Concurrent Planning involves meaningful family engagement throughout the case. It occurs through engagement with the child or youth, their parents and caregivers, and other people involved in the plans by way of on-going, consistent, clear, and honest conversations. The following tools are available to staff and can be used to assist them in engaging parents in conversations around concurrent planning throughout the life of a case: Handbook for Parents of Children in Foster Care (CS-304), the Concurrent Planning Checklist (CD-139), ecomap, genogram and CS-1. Reasonable efforts to finalize a concurrent goal should be made at the same time as efforts to reunify the child and family. Examples of reasonable efforts include: Establishment of paternity. Identification of relatives both in and out of state. Place child(ren) with relative or kinship provider. Ask a parent about Indian heritage, and notify Indian tribe or Bureau of Indian Affairs office, if applicable. Educate child, parents and relatives on what permanency options are available. Discuss permanency goals with the parent, child (if appropriate), relatives, child’s placement monthly and family support team; confirming whether or not they would like to be a permanency option if the child’s goal changed from reunification. Engage child’s therapist in concurrent planning therapeutic conversations if applicable. Document permanency conversations that are had with the Family Support Team, family, child and permanency resource. Complete timely requests to ICPC for out of state relatives; engage and encourage developing the relationship with the relative and child. Prepare the child’s adoption profile. If applicable, refer to the Chafee program. Additional definition and examples of reasonable efforts and diligent efforts can be found in Section 4, Chapter 8 and Chapter 10 Subsection 2. If a child has met the Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) timelines by being in care 15 out of 22 months and the current permanency goal is not working; the family support team must consider changing the permanency goal to an identified appropriate concurrent goal. Case Planning Chapter 211.181, RSMo, provides that within 30 days of the Division receiving custody of a child, a long-range permanency treatment plan shall be developed. To meet these requirements, the case manager shall complete a CS-1 in FACES after assessing the family. The first CS-1 case plan is due 30 days after the case is opened.  This will be updated and completed again at each six (6) month FST meeting.  This must be done for all children in custody. To clarify treatment needs for each family and/or child, the following procedures shall be followed: The worker shall ensure the Social Service Plan is completed with Parent/Caregiver/Guardians, Worker and Supervisor signatures within 30 days of the child(ren) coming into care. The Harm and Existing Safety section of the Social Service Plan identifies the threats of harm to the child(ren), the actual physical and emotional impact to the child(ren) and who caused or contributed to the harm. It also identifies the actions the Parent/Caregiver/Guardians have taken in the past to keep the child(ren) safe when the concerning behaviors were occurring, what supports they utilized to do so and what is currently occurring to keep the children safe. The Caregiver Danger/Safety Concerns/Risk of Harm section of the Social Service Plan is specific to each Parent/Caregiver/Guardian and contains everyone’s worries around the identified threats of harm (the Danger Statement(s)), the potential emotional and physical impact to the child(ren) if the harm were to continue and identification of the child(ren)’s vulnerabilities which cause them to be more susceptible to the harm. The Safety Goal(s), which include the behavioral changes which must be demonstrated by the Parent/Caregiver/Guardian so the team will be prepared to make a recommendation to move forward toward the next steps in the case goal and the anticipated positive emotional and physical impact these behavioral changes will have on the child(ren) when demonstrated. The continued reassessment of the Parent/Caregiver/Guardians protective capacities and identification of how the Parent/Caregiver/Guardian will be interacting with the children when they have successfully reached the Safety Goal(s). This section also contains the Next Steps, identification of supports/resources and plan(s) to address any complicating factors which cause the family difficulty or delay in successful completion of their Safety Goal(s). The Progress Assessment section of the Social Service Plan gathers each participant’s response during each reassessment period to ‘What good things are you seeing this Parent/Caregiver/Guardian doing and what progress have you observed toward the safety goal? ?’, their response to ‘What concerns do you still have regarding the progress or behaviors of the Parent/Caregiver/Guardian? ?’, their response to ‘What more needs to happen in relation to the Parent/Caregiver/Guardian behavioral changes to bring them closer to the safety goal? ?’ and any next step suggestions to help the family reach their safety goal(s). When gathering this information, be specific about documenting observed behavioral changes within the family. These individual responses, including those of the family, all natural supports, other members of the FST and Children’s Division shall be documented thoroughly in the Social Service Plan Progress Assessment section. Progress documented at the meeting will help the Family Support Team formulate a recommendation about any changes to the child’s permanency plan and placement, including reunification. The Long Term Safety/Support plan section of the Social Service Plan identifies the triggers that may lead to the harmful behavior, the Preventative Action Plan to help reduce the triggers from occurring, the signs that the harmful behavior may be starting or has started, the Response Action Plan to include who is responsible for keeping the child(ren) safe if the harmful behaviors do start, the date(s) Practice drills have occurred and who was involved, and Safety Network contact information. The Child section of the Social Service Plan will contain all identified needs of the child(ren) (i.e., physical, emotional, social, relational, medical, behavioral, mental health, etc.) through the life of the case and will identify the plan to meet those needs and the progress made towards completion and the child(ren)’s strengths. The Social Service Plan reassessments should occur every 90 days after the last completion date following the initial 30 day assessment through closing. The Social Service Plan closing reassessment should be completed within 15 days prior to the anticipated case closing date. The closing reassessment with Worker and Supervisor signatures should be reviewed with, signed by the family and a copy provided to the family at the closing visit. Provide a copy of the Social Service Plans Long Term Safety/Support Plan section to all parties who are noted to be participating in the Long Term Safety/Support plan. Example of Case Planning with a goal of Reunification See example of Social Service Plan on the SSP Instruction form Referral to Treatment Services During the treatment planning process, the FST will identify specific, culturally relevant resources to assist the family in accomplishing certain tasks and achieving stated goals. The FST should carefully consider the family’s capacity to benefit from the resource and the capacity of the resource to meet the needs of the family. Example:  A parent with limited reading and social skills and poor parenting skills would benefit more from Parents as Teachers than formalized parenting classes. Also, the Team should not overlook resources, which can be provided by other agencies, community organizations and natural helpers (family friends and kin).   For any resources the family utilizes, these will be noted in the Social Service Plan’s Progress Assessment section under ‘Who will assist or services to be accessed?’ All referrals or resources provided to the family, utilized or not, should be documented in the contact note in FACES. Housing Services – Coordinated Entry System When families experience homelessness or are at risk for homelessness the Coordinated Entry System (CES) should be accessed to connect them to housing services. The CES is Missouri’s primary resource to connect families to housing services no matter how or where they present. This resource allows staff to connect youth and families to Missouri’s array of housing services with one referral to an Access Point.   A listing of Coordinated Entry Access Points by region and county can be found HERE . All Access Point agencies will complete a pre-screening tool with clients and connect them with the appropriate level of housing services. A referral to the CES may be made at any point of involvement with CD when housing stability is a challenge. Population served includes, but is not limited to intact families, birth parents, potential relative placement providers, guardians, and older youth. Scenarios where CES referral MUST be made include the following: Case goal is reunification and the primary barrier is parents’ housing stability. Children who are on trial home visit and housing stability is preventing case closure. Older Youth preparing to exit care to independence and housing stability is at risk. All referrals and activities involving the CES shall be documented in a contact note in FACES. If permanent housing cannot be secured at the time of case closure, the efforts made and reasons housing could not be secured shall be documented in the closing summary.

"MO :: Section 4, Chapter 9 (Adoption And Guardianship Process), Subsection 6 – Subsidizing An Adoption/Legal Guardianship :: 9.6.13 Missouri Special Needs Adoption Tax Credit",Missouri,Rules,"2023, 2022","Adoption, Definitions, Forms - Financial",,,"Missouri families adopting a child on or after January 1, 2022, regardless of whether the child is a special needs child may be eligible to receive a Missouri Adoption Tax Credit for nonrecurring adoption expenses. These expenses can be claimed up to $10,000 if the adopting parent(s) has not been reimbursed by federal, state or local resources (sections 135.325 – 135.339, RSMo) or the expenses incurred by the family exceed those reimbursed by federal, state or local resources. The following material instructs staff in cooperating with the Missouri Department of Revenue in determining if a family may claim the tax credit. Individuals and business entities may claim a tax credit for their total nonrecurring adoption expenses in each year that the expenses are incurred. A claim for fifty percent of the credit shall be allowed when the child is placed in the home. A claim for the remaining fifty percent shall be allowed when the adoption is final.  The total of these tax credits shall not exceed the maximum limit of ten thousand dollars per child. The cumulative amount of tax credits that may be claimed by taxpayers claiming the credit for nonrecurring adoption expenses in any one fiscal year prior to July 1, 2004 shall not be more than two million dollars, but may be increased by appropriation in any fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2004, and ending on or before June 30, 2021. The cumulative amount of tax credits that may be claimed by taxpayers claiming the credit for nonrecurring adoption expenses shall not exceed six million dollars in any fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2021. Statutory Requirements This tax relief law became effective January 1, 1988, (last revised August 28, 2021), and sets forth the following requirements: Definitions: Nonrecurring adoption expenses – Reasonable and necessary adoption fees, court costs, attorney fees, and other expenses which are directly related to the legal adoption of a special needs child and which are not incurred in violation of federal, state, or local laws. Children who have been adopted, regardless of whether the child adopted is a resident or ward of a resident of this state at the time the adoption is initiated; however, priority will be given to applications to claim the tax credit for special needs children who are residents or war wards of residents of this state at the time the adoption is initiated. Children who are residents or wards of a resident of this state at the time the adoption is initiated. The child must reside in Missouri or be under the custody of a resident of Missouri at the time the adoption is initiated in order to qualify for a portion of the $2 million of the available tax credit. Internationally adopted and children adopted from another state do not meet this criterion, because they are not residents of this state at the time their adoption is initiated, regardless of where their adoption is finalized. If internationally adopted, or children adopted from another state meet special needs criteria they could qualify for a portion of the remaining $2 million in tax credits allowed by the statute. Disability- A mental, physical, or emotional impairment that limits one or more major life activity, whether the impairment is congenital or acquired by accident, injury or disease, and is verified by medical findings. Special needs child – A child who meets the following criteria: Has a specific factor or condition such as age, membership in a sibling group, medical condition, or disability about which it is reasonable to conclude that the child cannot be easily placed for adoption; Except where it would be against the best interest of the child because of significant emotional ties with the prospective adoptive parent(s) while in their care as a foster child, a reasonable, but unsuccessful effort has been made to place the child; and The Children’s Division, a child-placing agency, or the juvenile court has determined that the child cannot be returned to the parents. Limitations – Adoptive parent(s) may not claim a tax credit if: The nonrecurring adoption expenses were paid through funds received under a federal, state, or local program and their expenses did not exceed what was covered by those programs; The child is over age 18 at the time of adoption unless the child has a condition which limits his ability to live independently; or For any amount of the tax credit carried forward (for up to five (5) years as allowed in section 135.333, RSMo) if the juvenile court temporarily or finally relieves the adoptive parent(s) of custody of the child. In administering this law, the Children’s Division is responsible for the following activities: Certifying a child’s eligibility as a special needs child when the child was placed by the Division or into a Division adoptive home; Certifying for all special needs adoptions that nonrecurring adoption expenses were not reimbursed by federal, state or local funds or the expenses incurred by the family exceed those reimbursed by federal, state or local resources; Completing the appropriate parts (Part D – Certification that Nonrecurring expenses will not be Reimbursed and Part E – Verification of “Special Needs Child”) of the Missouri Department of Revenue Adoption Tax Credit Claim (Form ATC) when presented by the adoptive parent(s); and Develop an Adoption Tax Credit File for each tax year. This file is to be maintained by a designated staff person in each county/circuit office. This file is to be entitled, Adoption Tax Credit FY”. A copy of the ATC Log is to be attached to the front, inside cover of the file. All signed ATC forms are to be logged onto this form, including forms that were submitted for children who have been in the custody of the Children’s Division. Procedural Requirements The adoptive parent must have, with the exception of Part D and Part E, the entire ATC form completed prior to the Children’s Division providing assurances and signatures. Procedures for a child in Children’s Division custody at the time of adoptive placement when the adoptive family chooses to receive the Adoption Tax Credit and chooses not to receive services through the Missouri Adoption Subsidy Program, or their nonrecurring expenses exceeded what was provided through subsidy. If their expenses did exceed what was provided in the subsidy, they can claim the amount that was in excess of what subsidy covered: Determine that the child meets all the special needs eligibility. Complete Part E of the ATC form if the child meets all the eligibility criteria. If the child does not meet the criteria, confirm this in writing and allow the adoptive parent(s) to provide additional information Review the expenses listed in Part C by the adoptive parent(s) to determine if any of these were paid through the Missouri Adoption Subsidy Program or any other source other than the adoptive parent(s). CD workers shall utilize the steps outlined in letter C under Children’s Division responsibilities. If it is determined that some of the expenses were paid by one of the sources listed above, the adoptive parent(s) must adjust the expenses accordingly before the worker completes Part D. If the adoptive parent refuses to adjust the expenses, the worker need not complete the form and shall document, in writing to the adoptive parent, why the form was not completed. A copy of this documentation should be kept with the form by the worker, in the corresponding year’s ATC file. NOTE:  Adoption subsidy funds are federal and state funds. Local funds used to offset nonrecurring expenses could include local government or private sources. Staff should explore with the adoptive family or the appropriate agency, if applicable, whether any local funds were used to offset the nonrecurring adoption expenses. Staff will need to review the Payment History screens in FACES to determine if the Children’s Division previously paid any claimed funds through an Adoption Subsidy Agreement. Complete Part D if there are nonrecurring adoption expenses which are eligible for the tax credit. Return: The completed form ATC to the adoptive parent(s); or The incomplete form ATC to the adoptive parent(s) with a written explanation of why the Children’s Division cannot certify the child’s special needs eligibility and/or that no federal, state or local funds were used to pay the claimed nonrecurring adoption expenses. File a copy of form ATC with all supporting material and correspondence in the adoptive parent(s) case record. Log this ATC form and the required information on the ATC Log, located in the front inside cover of the corresponding year’s Adoption Tax Credit File. Procedures for a child who was not in Children’s Division’s custody at the time of adoptive placement: Refer the adoptive parent(s) to the juvenile court for children independently placed for assistance in determining the child’s special needs eligibility (Part E of the ATC form); or The adoptive parent(s) to the appropriate licensed child-placing agency, Division of Youth Services (DYS) or Department of Mental Health (DMH) for assistance in determining the child’s special needs eligibility (Part E of the ATC form); NOTE:  If the licensed child-placing agency, or the court, which finalized the adoption, is not locally accessible to the family, it is not necessary to refer the adoptive family to one of these services. The Division may complete Part E of the ATC form if the child meets the special needs eligibility criteria in order to save the family from tracking down the agency or court. The family should provide some form of documentation supporting this such as medical documentation, the child’s birth certificate, the foreign adoption decree or papers from immigration. Review the expenses listed in Part C by the adoptive parent(s) to determine if any of these were paid through the Missouri Adoption Subsidy Program or any other source other than the adoptive parent(s). If it is determined that some of the expenses were paid by one of the sources listed above, the adoptive parent(s) must adjust the expenses accordingly before the worker completes Part D. If the adoptive parent refuses to adjust the expenses, the worker need not complete the form and shall document, in writing to the adoptive parent, why the form was not completed. A copy of this documentation should be kept with the form by the worker, in the corresponding year’s ATC file. NOTE: Workers will need to review the Payment History screens in FACES to determine if the Children’s Division previously made payment through an Adoption Subsidy Agreement, particularly for children previously in the custody of a licensed child-placing agency, DYS or DMH. Complete Part D of the ATC form to certify that no federal, state or local funds were expended to meet the nonrecurring adoption expenses listed in Part C. Make a copy of form ATC and retain for five (5) years with related correspondence in a file for “Adoption Tax Credit FY” requests.

"MO :: Section 4, Chapter 9 (Adoption And Guardianship Process), Subsection 6 – Subsidizing An Adoption/Legal Guardianship :: 9.6.12.2 Divorcing Adoptive Parents Or Guardians",Missouri,Rules,"2023, 2022","Adoption, Guardianship, Legal process, Subsidies - Other",,,"When adoptive parents or guardians enter into a legal separation or divorce situation, it often becomes necessary to take one of the parents/guardians off the subsidy agreement. Encourage the parent/guardian to address the subsidy directly with their attorney so that the court can perhaps order one parent/guardian to receive the subsidy. The Division does not have the authority to remove one parent/guardian from the agreement without supporting documentation and a court order. In order to do this, one of the following must occur: There must be an order from the court, assigning one of the parents/guardians physical custody of the child covered under subsidy. This order could be a full child order of protection or a custody order; or If the order is a full child order of protection, the worker may take the non-caretaking parent’s/guardian’s name off the Vendor Licensure/Approval and Renewal screen in FACES once a copy of that order is received so that the subsidy payment will be made to the parent/guardian caring for the child. A full child order of protection is valid for up to 180 days. Therefore, the caretaking parent/guardian should provide the agency with a custody order within six months, or an extended child order of protection in order to continue the subsidy in this way. The parent/guardian caring for the child will be expected to obtain a custody order, in order to take the non-caretaking parent/guardian off the subsidy agreement. Once the custody order is received, revise the existing version of the agreement to remove the parent or guardian. A new agreement number will be assigned by DFAS Purchasing Unit. Staff should update FACES and send supporting documentation to the Adoption Subsidy Unit in Central Office. The adoptive parent or guardian who is not caring for the child agrees to be taken off the subsidy agreement; or The parent or guardian caring for the child must provide a written request to the Division, requesting that the non-caretaking parent or guardian be removed from the subsidy agreement. The non-caretaking parent or guardian must provide a notarized statement regarding their agreement to this action, to be placed in the file. If the parent/guardian receiving the subsidy payment is not financially supporting the subsidized child with the subsidy, specific documentation of this must be utilized to close the subsidy due to the lack of financial support and a new subsidy Agreement may be opened under the parent/guardian who is caring for the child. If this action is taken, the following steps must occur: Write the adoptive parent(s) or guardian(s) a letter stating that the subsidy will be closed within 30 days due to the lack of financial support of the child. Document the evidence on which this decision has been based. Wait 30 days for a response. The parent/guardian who has been receiving the subsidy may decide to begin forwarding financial support to the care-taking parent/guardian. If so, document this information in the case dictation. If after 30 days, the care-taking parent/guardian reports continued lack of financial support from the parent/guardian who has been receiving the subsidy payment, proceed to step 3.c. Close the old Vendor using the Vendor Licensure/Approval and Renewal screen, and the old subsidy agreement. Open a new Vendor Application in the name of the parent/guardian caring for the child. Complete new subsidy paperwork, including a new Adoption Subsidy Agreement, CD AD, or Subsidized Guardianship Agreement, CD SG, with the parent/guardian caring for the child. Update the Alternative Care Client screen, or the Adoption Assistance Client Information screen in FACES to reflect the new vendor number. If both parent(s)/guardian(s) continue to disagree on the subsidy, it is not the responsibility of the Division staff to make any decisions or take any actions without a court order. Division staff are to encourage the parent(s) or guardian(s) to work with their attorneys with regard to this matter. In the event that a divorce occurs with a guardianship couple, the guardianship subsidy may only remain in effect with the qualified relative retaining physical custody.

Should the child have a subsequent adoption/guardianship, they may be eligible for subsidy in their new placement, if the placement was an eligible placement for subsidy. Upon the death of one adoptive parent or guardian no contract action is needed. The original agreement will remain in both names. A copy of the death certificate should be kept in the file. FACES must be updated to reflect the surviving parent or guardian. Subsequent amendments will be accepted with only the signature of the surviving parent. Use the explanation section on the amendment to explain the reason why there is only one signature. When it is determined that a single guardian is deceased, the Children’s Division should close the guardianship agreement and ensure the safety of the child. Alternate placement with another relative or qualified close nonrelated person should be sought or a referral made to the juvenile court for placement in Children’s Division custody after consultation with supervisory staff; and if possible, a Family Support team meeting. If a successor guardian (qualified relative or close nonrelated person) is named in the agreement prior to the death of the legal guardian, the Division shall immediately contact the person(s) named to inquire if the individual is willing to assume guardianship. If the successor guardian is willing, conduct fingerprint-based criminal checks, CA/N registry checks of the prospective guardian(s) and all other adults living in the home prior to the prospective guardian(s) filing the petition or negotiation of a subsidy agreement.

In situations where a Missouri child is being adopted through a Missouri private child-placing agency, and the adoptive parent’s state of residence is not Missouri it is the adoptive parents’ state of residence where the adoption assistance application should be made. In that event, the public child welfare agency in the adoptive parents’ state of residence is responsible for determining whether the child meets the definition of special needs, entering into the adoption assistance agreement and paying the subsidy, consistent with the way public benefits are paid in other programs (ACYF-CB-PA-01-01/January 23, 2001). If this child is not determined to be IV-E eligible, this policy does not apply, and the Missouri Children’s Division will be responsible for assisting in the adoption subsidy process.

All requirements in this procedure apply in the use of the program for a child in the custody of one of the above three agencies. The Division approves the agreement and administers payment according to the terms of the agreement. Coordination between these agencies and the Division will be needed to assure the eligible child receives all appropriate services. Special needs children, known to other agencies, who are not eligible for the Missouri Adoption Subsidy Program, may be eligible for payment of nonrecurring adoption expenses. In the coordination needed to make this service available, it is generally expected that, except for the Division’s final approval, the other agency will carry out, with families approved by them, all interpretation of the program and processing of forms related to the program and any prior authorizations required for the expenditure of funds. County/circuit offices will be expected to provide assistance, as needed, to the agency and to approve, as required, the expenditure of adoption subsidy funds. In making this program accessible to children in the custody of these agencies, Division county/circuit offices should apply the following guidelines: Other agencies shall have the responsibility for: Interpretation of the program including its benefits and limitations to adoptive families approved by them; Processing the Application for Adoption Subsidy CD APP AD, and the Adoption Subsidy Agreement CD AD, except for the required Division signatures and approval process; Interpreting the requirements for payment of nonrecurring adoption expenses when a special needs child is not eligible for the Missouri Adoption Subsidy Program (MASP); Processing the Application and Agreement for Payment of Nonrecurring Adoption Expenses CS-SA-4, and forwarding to the Division for the required signatures; Yearly contact with the families to insure the best services are being provided to families and children; as well as completing any amendments to the subsidy agreement for the addition of new services.

The prospective adoptive parent(s) are asked to complete the Application for Adoption Subsidy, CD APP AD. The prospective guardian parent(s) are asked to complete the Application for Subsidized Guardianship, CD APP SG. With the assistance of the worker, the physical, mental health, dental and emotional needs of the child are to be fully documented on the Applications and, subsequent to the meeting, in the narrative portion of the subsidy record for present and future reference. Private child-placing agencies that are approaching the negotiation of a new adoption or guardianship subsidy Agreement are to forward the application for subsidy to their local Children’s Division staff for review of eligibility. The Children’s Division should then send back, within 10 working days, a letter approving the child’s eligibility as well as approval to proceed with negotiation of the Subsidy Agreement or a letter denying the child’s eligibility. A copy of the letter as well as the Application for Subsidy is to be kept in a subsidy file in the local Children’s Division office. Children’s Division staff, Foster Care case management staff and private child-placing agencies who have been given approval to proceed with the negotiation of the Subsidy Agreement, should then discuss with the family the needs for which the family feels they can assume responsibility. It is not necessary for staff to document the detailed income and expenses of the family nor shall a means test be used. Staff should fully discuss with the family their many resources; emotional, physical and financial, and encourage them to utilize these resources. Staff should also review with families the community resources available to meet the child’s needs and make referrals as appropriate. The goal of the negotiation should be to review with the family the current and anticipated needs of the child and to prepare the family for what lies ahead in a collaborative with the agency, planning for the current needs through completion of the Subsidy Agreement; as well as acknowledging the potential future needs by fully documenting on the Application. At the time of the initial negotiation of the Subsidy Agreement, the family should be advised that this Agreement is a legally binding contract and will continue in effect until the last day of the month of the child’s 18th birthday; unless it is terminated as a result of the parent’s or guardian’s request or reasons for termination listed in the contract. If no changes are necessary during the life of the Agreement, no further action is necessary. If changes are required, an amendment section will be completed within the body of the contract. Each amendment is made to the Agreement as a whole and the entire completed Subsidy Agreement will need to accompany every amendment when sent to the Subsidy Unit in Central Office. All guardianship subsidy Agreements end at age 18 as does the legal guardianship established by the court, therefore, there is no option for extension beyond the age of 18. At the time of the initial negotiation the parent(s) should also be advised that an Agreement must be approved by signature of the Division Director or designee prior to payment being made. At the time of initial negotiation of the legal guardianship agreement, staff must discuss and advise the guardian(s) of the option to name a successor guardian in the agreement. A successor guardian is a person(s) named in the guardianship agreement or amendment who becomes the alternative legal guardian in the event of the legal guardian(s) death or incapacitation. To assist in this discussion, the Successor Guardian Information letter, CD-222, may be given to the family. Once completed this letter should be retained in the guardianship file. The guardian(s) are to be advised the child will not be automatically eligible for guardianship assistance in the event of their death or incapacitation if a successor is not named without the child/ren having to be placed in the custody of the Children’s Division. If the guardian elects not to exercise the option to name a successor guardian this discussion and decision are to be documented in the narrative section of the guardianship subsidy record and in the explanation section of the subsidy agreement. Adoptive parent(s) and Guardians should also be advised of their right to file an appeal, as specified in the subsidy contract, on all or any part of a Subsidy Agreement that is denied by the Division Director or designee. Their request for appeal must be received within 10 days of their written notice of the denial decision. If approved time-limited services beyond the basic subsidy package expire on the Agreement or a new service needs to be added, an amendment must be developed between the family and the agency for payment for services to be made. The adoptive parent and legal guardian(s) should be encouraged to make application for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) with the local Social Security Administration (SSA) office for any potentially eligible children. Adoptive parent(s) accepting a child for adoptive placement who is eligible for Title IV-E adoption subsidy, have the right to determine whether SSI or adoption subsidy IV-E would be more appropriate to meet the maintenance payment for the child in the context of his/her and their circumstances. Parents of children who receive state-only funded adoption subsidy may receive both. The adoptive parent of the IV-E child may also receive both funds; however, parents should be advised that the Social Security office may reduce the SSI amount the child receives, dollar for dollar, by the amount the child is receiving in subsidy maintenance. If the family decides to accept SSI, the Children’s Service Worker will need to update the client’s fund code from ‘04-Adoption Subsidy IV-E to ‘05-Adoption Subsidy FFP’, and update the Title XIX begin date simultaneously to reflect when fund “05” begins. During the time children received out-of-home care services, they may have been eligible for SSI. Eligibility for SSI will be determined by completing the Adoption Subsidy Determination upon adoption. A child that has a Subsidized Guardianship Agreement, has been determined by the state to have special medical, mental health or rehabilitative needs, and cannot be placed for guardianship without medical assistance. The child is eligible for MO HealthNet. A child, Title IV-E or non IV-E, covered by an Adoption Subsidy Agreement, who is eligible for SSI is also eligible for MO HealthNet- FFP. In this case, fund category “05” is reported on the Alternative Care Client Information screen/SS-61 in FACES. If the child becomes ineligible for SSI, the child’s fund category shall be changed to “03-Adoption Subsidy HDN (state only)” or “04-Adoption Subsidy IV-E” depending on the child’s eligibility for IV-E prior to the final adoption. A child, who is not Title IV-E eligible, but has a state-funded adoption assistance Agreement, has been determined by the state to have special medical, mental health or rehabilitative needs and cannot be placed for adoption without medical assistance, is eligible for MO HealthNet-FFP (fund code 05) for adoption. OASDI benefits can be received after adoption. Adoptive parent(s) are encouraged to make application for these benefits with the SSA office before making use of either of the Division’s IV-E or HDN funding resources for a child’s subsidy. Children’s Service Workers should make prospective adoptive parent(s) aware of this resource and assist them in making application when indicated. The Change of Custodian Payee Request Form is available to assist adoptive parents with this process. A subsidy Agreement can be developed using Title IV-E or HDN funds along with OASDI if needed. Prior to final adoption, staff must assure that the child’s resources, if any, does not exceed $10,000.00. If it exceeds this amount, the fund category must be changed to “05”. Once the amount is below $10,000.00, notify the Eligibility Analyst and the fund code can be modified to “04.” As required by the Subsidy Agreement, adoptive parent(s) and guardians have the responsibility for reporting changes of income and/or resources to the Social Security office. In addition to this, staff should confirm if the child remains SSI eligible whenever in contact with the family. Adoptive parents and guardians should be advised that the Division of Finance Administration will notify the Social Security Administration when final adoption occurs. This will result in the immediate termination of the Children’s Division as payee for SSI/OASDI. To avoid a lapse in payment, application by the adoptive parent(s) should be made promptly. The date Adoption Subsidy Agreements are signed is important in relationship to the court’s adoption proceedings. Adoption subsidy must be in place before finalization of the adoption, meaning the adoption Agreement must be signed by both the adoptive parent(s) and Children’s Division Director or designee prior to finalization. Subsidized Guardianship Agreements shall be completed and approved prior to the court proceeding to award guardianship, meaning that the Guardianship Agreement must be signed by both the guardian(s) and Children’s Director or designee prior to final award of Guardianship. The Agreement, however, cannot go into effect until after the guardianship is awarded and the fund code “06” has been entered by the worker in FACES. A copy of the order of legal guardianship shall be sent to the Procurement Unit with the Subsidized Guardianship Agreement. If negotiated prior to the guardianship being established, the order shall be sent to CMU when the Alternative Care Client Information screen is changed. The legal guardianship begin date on the Alternative Care Client Information screen shall be the date the guardianship was awarded. The fund code will be determined by the Eligibility Analyst in cases of subsidized guardianship. Expenses to be paid under the Subsidized Guardianship Agreement will only occur after the legal guardianship has been granted by the probate court to a qualified relative as defined by Missouri Statute 453.072. Prior to subsidy funding being utilized a referral must be made to the IV-E Eligibility Analysts to determine the fund code for subsidy. A child’s placement type must be changed just before the referral to the Eligibility Analysts for determination of the subsidy fund code is made. At the time of the placement change to ADF, ADO, ADR or FAH the fund code should be changed to 12 for the placement change to be accepted. These changes must be indicated on the child’s Alternative Care Client Information screen in FACES for the Eligibility Analysts to make a determination. In addition, the subsidy contract must be approved and in the contracting system. The petition pursuing guardianship must be filed. Termination of Parental Rights (TPR) of at least two parents must be shown on the Alternative Care Client Information screen and the adoption petition must have been filed. Within 5 days of this placement type change, the referral must be made to the Eligibility Analysts. At this point the child’s plan is adoption or legal guardianship, the necessary steps have been taken for adoption or guardianship subsidy funding, and foster care funds are no longer appropriate. Prior to the subsidy funding determination, the worker may have indicated the pre-adoptive placement on the Alternative Care Client Information screen without changing the placement type. The Eligibility Analyst needs the following information in order to complete a determination. If the child is from a private agency, the worker from the private agency is to obtain this information for the CD’s referring worker: A copy of the Title IV-E/FFP Referral, (CS-IV-E-FFP-1) is to be filed in the family’s subsidy record to provide documentation of the eligibility determination. Information about the home from which the child was removed; Removal petition; Court order that placed the child in the agency’s custody; Date the adoption or guardianship petition was filed; Date TPR occurred; Date adoptive placement began; and Begin date on the adoption subsidy contract. The Eligibility Analysts may determine fund code eligibility and authorize payment from subsidy fund codes (fund codes 03, 04 and 05) (fund code 06 for state only funded guardianships and fund code 16 for Title IV-E eligible guardianship subsidy) and are the only staff that have authority to change adoption subsidy fund codes and may only do so after the following criteria have been met: Termination of Parental Rights has been granted on at least 2 parents or the parents are deceased; The family has been identified as the adoptive or guardianship placement as shown in the placement information section of the Alternative Care Client Information screen. An adoption petition or guardianship petition has been filed with the court; and A Subsidy Agreement has been approved and entered into the contract management system. Subsidy Agreements may be reassessed at the request of the adoptive parent(s) or guardian when changes in the needs of the child or the circumstances of the family are indicated. Adoptive parent(s) or guardian are expected and required to cooperate in the review process for services that expire and need to be re-authorized. Such cooperation includes supplying information regarding the family and the eligible child’s circumstances as determined by the Division to be needed. This information will be used to establish the services and amount of payment for the services included in the agreement. This information must be supplied to the Division within 30 days of the request. Relatives, with the exception of a biological parent or step-parent, are eligible for an adoption subsidy. Such subsidies are to be handled as if an unrelated family was adopting the child. To meet costs for a service that may be needed any time after the final decree, but before the child’s 18th birthday, adoption subsidy Agreements including only MO HealthNet should be completed prior to the granting of the final decree. These are considered deferred Agreements and are intended to serve those children with a guarded prognosis because of drug exposure, familial history of mental illness or other genetic predisposition, for whom an adoptive family may need future assistance in meeting the cost of special needs, but who may not require such assistance at the time of placement or adoption completion. It is important that the condition or special needs or the circumstances of the guarded prognosis of the child exist at the time the child is placed with the family, and are well documented on the Application for Adoption Subsidy, CD APP AD. An amendment to the Agreement must be processed to authorize payment for additional services when/if they are needed. Upon a change in the subsidy Agreement via an amendment, the worker shall note the change and negotiation around the change in the narrative section of the subsidy file. For confidentiality purposes, the child’s name used in all business and record keeping transactions should be the name stipulated in the final decree of adoption. This includes the records of the Children’s Division as well as the records used by vendors from whom we are purchasing a service as a part of the Adoption Subsidy Agreement. All records should be changed after the final decree except for the first Application for Adoption Subsidy, CD APP AD, and the Adoption Subsidy Agreement, CD AD. When preparing a new amendment there is space indicated to include the adopted name as well as a new DCN, if applicable (Departmental Client Number). When reviewing an Agreement after the final decree of adoption or legal guardianship is granted, information from other treatment and rehabilitative service providers may be required by the Division. This information must be obtained by the adoptive parent(s) and provided to the Division within 30 days of the request being made as indicated in the Agreement. Agency staff should refer adoptive parents or guardians who request information regarding reporting subsidy payments for income tax purposes to the Internal Revenue Service or their individual tax preparer.

If a child enters a Level B Foster Home, the worker should manage the case the same as if the child were in residential treatment. The CD-137 is to serve as the referral form for placement in Level B Foster Care. Supporting documentation from appropriate professionals is also required. The parent(s)/guardian(s) are to complete the CD-137 and provide documentation, obtaining assistance from the worker as needed. Level B Foster Care placements may be authorized for six months at a time. Upon the sixth month, the need for placement and level of care must be reviewed in a family meeting. The review team should consist of the family, child, worker, supervisor, Level B resource providers and any other persons involved in the treatment of the child.

The TLP is not a treatment program but is for the purpose of preparing youth to live independently in their community. It is not for youth who need community adult services to manage their day to day life. Youth under the age of 18, which represent the adoption subsidy population, are only eligible for the Transitional Living Group Home services. As these placements have been youth in the custody of the Children’s Division, consideration must be given to place a non-custodial youth with a custodial youth. If a youth is a danger to other children in the adoptive home such as a current offender, Transitional Living may not be a “fit” for the adoption subsidy youth as our role of custodian is to ensure safety of the youth in the TLP. Prior to a referral being made, all options must be explored and documented in the case record. Individual assessment and consideration must occur for youth who receive adoption subsidy to enter into a TLG to ensure the youth is not being set up for exit to homelessness as the youth must exit the program at age 18 in most cases. If the adoptive parent(s) or guardian(s) is unwilling to be a part of this process and has no desire for the youth to be returned to their home, the TLP may not be authorized through subsidy. If accepted, the family shall develop a plan for successful reintegration back into the home of the adoptive parent(s) or guardian(s). Steps to Be Taken: The family will contact the Adoption Specialist for out of home placement consideration for youth 16 and older. The Adoption Specialist will begin discussions with the Older Youth Transition Specialist (OYTS) as to feasibility of TLP as an option. All resources will be explored and exhausted. The Transitional Living Program will be a last option. A referral will be made to the OYTS via email or fax. Contact information for the OYTS may be found here: https://dss.mo.gov/cd/older-youth-program/files/map-older-youth-transition-specialist.pdf The referral shall include the following documents provided by the Adoptive Parent: Youth’s Statement of Understanding of TLP Parent’s Statement of Understanding of TLP, Involvement, and Plan for Youth to Return Home Most Recent Psychological Evaluation – If Applicable Criminal History – If Applicable Current School Report Current IEP – If Applicable Medical History Immunization Records Copy of Birth Certificate Social Security Card Completed CS-9, including section E Completed Adolescent FST Guide (CD94) Completed Individualized Action Plan Goals (CD94) Copy of Approved Subsidy Agreement or e-mail from Adoption Subsidy Program Specialist indicating approval to explore TLP placement. The OYTS will determine if there is space and compatibility for the youth to be placed in the TLP. As TLP is a contractual program in which all referrals must come from the OYTS and the service provision is for youth in care, if there is not space or a safety concern for an adoption subsidy youth to be around other youth exists, the referral will be denied by the OYTS. If the youth is accepted into the program, a Family Centered Service case will be opened to assist the youth and family towards reunification and preparation of a successful exit plan for transition from TLP. It is expected that the family would visit the youth and be fully engaged in transition planning at placement and throughout the time the youth is it the program. The Adoption Specialist will continue communication with the OYTS throughout the placement of the youth in the TLP.

The amendment must be signed by the Authorized Signature of the Department of Social Services before residential services may begin and payment for such services made. Any time the subsidy worker receives a request to place a child in residential treatment, the worker shall make a referral to IIS as an attempt to divert placement out of the home. This is to be treated as any other IIS case, and to be paid for out of county funds. If the IIS intervention is unsuccessful, or the parent(s)/guardian(s) refuse to use IIS, the worker is to begin working with the family towards other alternatives such as the use of community resources or residential treatment. Community resources are to be researched by the parent/guardian, with assistance from the worker, and efforts documented, prior to making a residential treatment referral. The worker shall notify the parent(s)/guardian(s) of services that are available within the community which might prevent the child from being removed from their community and being placed in residential treatment. The worker shall ensure the parent(s)/guardian(s) tried to access these services before seeking residential care. The worker may complete the Initial Referral – Residential Subsidy (CD-233) form with the parent(s)/guardian(s) in order to evaluate the child’s need for residential services. This is an optional form staff may use to help guide the discussion with the family during an initial meeting regarding residential services. The parent(s)/guardian(s) must complete the Residential and Specialized Placement Referral, CS-9, with the assistance of the worker. Documentation of the child’s condition from appropriate professionals (psychological, psychiatric, etc.) is required and must be obtained by the parent(s)/guardian(s). The CS-9 must be sent through the appropriate channels to the Authorized Designee for ASRT approvals in the region. The Authorized Designee will determine the child’s need for residential treatment; the level of care needed, and assist the parent(s)/guardian(s) in obtaining a residential treatment facility for the child in close proximity to their home to allow involvement by the parent(s)/guardian(s) in the child’s treatment. The Adoption and Guardianship Subsidy Residential Referral (CD-302) must be completed, signed by the Authorized Designee, and included as supporting documentation when submitting an initial subsidy contract, amendment, or attachment that includes a request for residential services. The parent should be provided with a letter of approval indicating the amount which will be paid. The parent/guardian is responsible for making arrangements for actual placement into the residential facility. The letter to the parent(s)/guardian(s) should also include information as a reminder that: Residential level changes require a new approval. Documentation provided by the facility on behalf of the parent/guardian must support the level being requested and be no more than 90 days old and include an estimated discharge date and prognosis, a monthly treatment summary, why a continued need for residential respite exists, and a description of parental involvement with the facility/treatment plan. Once a child has been approved for residential treatment and it is on the subsidy contract, the worker will no longer refer the family to FCS unless there has been CA/N or significant needs to warrant an FCS case.  Staff should consult with their supervisor. Once the child has been placed, the worker may complete an initial home visit with the family as best practice, to gather information from the family about the child, their experiences, etc.  If the worker is unable to complete a home visit, they will communicate with the family by phone or email.  Monthly home visits may occur if the family and worker feel it is beneficial. Monthly meetings are expected to keep the family engaged and accountable.  Meetings may be provided and facilitated with the residential treatment team.  Both parent(s)/guardian(s) and subsidy workers will participate.  These can be held in conjunction with the facility’s treatment team meetings, or be held separately if a treatment team meeting isn’t held that month.  These can be done in person or by conference call. Staff may use the Ongoing Meetings – Residential Subsidy (CD-232) form to document the progress of the child and family.  This form is to help guide discussions regarding the progress of the child and transition back into the home. Staff should document all communication via Case Member screen using the active case number. Subsidy may be authorized for the cost of residential treatment at the level determined by the Authorized Designee. As with all services, payment for residential treatment will not be made until the service has been approved by the Authorized Signature of the Department of Social Services and shall not be backdated Payment for these services must be made under the terms of the contracts the Division has with Missouri providers. Whether in state or out of Missouri, the Missouri contract rate will apply. Placements for children who are residents of Missouri will only be sought with Missouri residential facilities or facilities in bordering states because of the proximity to the adoptive home, or when the necessary treatment cannot be provided by a Missouri facility. Residential placements may be authorized for only six months at a time. Upon the sixth month, the documentation supporting the need for placement and level of care must be reviewed in a family meeting and the documentation provided to the Authorized Designee. The meeting should consist of the family, child, worker, supervisor, facility and any other persons involved in the treatment of the child. These reviews, along with the approval of the Authorized Designee, are to be submitted to Central Office with the amendment indicating a continued need for funding for residential treatment. No payment should be made until the amendment is approved by signature of the Authorized Signature of the Department of Social Services and approval should be given at least 30 days prior to expiration of the prior amendment to avoid any interruption in services. Requests for out-of-state residential treatment are to be reviewed by the Residential Service Manager in consultation with Central Office, if necessary. The Residential Service Manager must have already determined a level of care. Residential treatment will be reimbursed at the rates of contracted providers located within Missouri. When using out-of-state residential or Missouri non-contracted facilities, the worker is to contact the Residential Service Manager in order to request that a child-specific-contract be sent to the vendor. The worker and the Residential Service Manager are to work together with the vendor in order to negotiate the monthly rate. Contract Management Unit (CMU) are available for technical assistance while completing this process. Out-of-state providers being utilized for families who reside out of state must have a child-specific contract with the Division in order to receive payment. The provider must submit a child-specific contract to the CMU for negotiation. Update the Alternative Care Client Information screen in FACES new placement by leaving the adoptive parent(s)/guardian(s) Departmental Vendor Number (DVN) and placement type, but entering the sub-placement code of “S”, and changing the maintenance code to no maintenance. In the sub-placement type indicate the residential facility where the child is residing. In certain circumstances use may be made of residential treatment services which are not currently covered by a contract with the Division. A contract must be developed between the facility and the Division by the facility, proposing a child-specific contract regarding the proposed care for the child. Payment shall not be made directly to the adoptive parent(s) or guardian(s). In the case of children attending different school districts, the school district where the parent(s)/guardian(s) reside should be charged for any special education services needed. The subsidy worker shall meet with the adoptive or guardianship family to discuss the child’s needs while in residential treatment, and explore the possibility of reducing the maintenance payment while the child is in treatment determining only the amount necessary while the child is in residential care (i.e. toiletries, clothing, and travel for visitation and therapy.) If the family agrees to suspend maintenance while the child is in the facility, this should be indicated in the narrative of the subsidy file and the maintenance code should be changed to no maintenance. According to federal policy (ACYF-CB-PA-O1-01) the agency cannot lower an adoptive family’s amount of maintenance without the family’s concurrence. If the family does agree to lower their maintenance, this is to be documented in the narrative section of the subsidy record and the reduced amount indicated on the alternative care client information record. If the family is unwilling to be a part of this process and has no desire for the child to be returned to their home, residential treatment may not be authorized through subsidy and the subsidy worker is to discuss other permanency options with the family. If the child enters the custody of the Children’s Division, the Division will pursue child support from the adoptive parent(s)/guardian(s). Day treatment services may be considered on a child-specific, time-limited basis. Adequate documentation must support the need for day treatment. The adoptive or guardianship family must first inquire as to the ability of their private insurance to pay for all or part of this treatment prior to the agency approving this service through subsidy. In addition, a self-referral to the Department of Mental Health (DMH) may be appropriate to determine if they can assist in funding any or all of the day treatment services. Based upon their assessment, DMH may be able to provide services to the family which are not available through the Division. Services may only be approved for up to six months at a time, and a family meeting must occur.

Staff is encouraged to utilize the behavioral consultants to assist in determining eligibility Children in foster care, who receive Level A or Medical maintenance, are required to have regular six-month reviews. If a regular review is overdue, or if a review is due within 60 days, the review must be completed within one month upon the determination that adoption or guardianship is the goal for the child. The purpose of this staffing is to verify a continued need for above base maintenance. The child must then be staffed every six months until adoption or guardianship is finalized. The subsidy worker must submit the approved staffing results with the request for above base maintenance, in order for the child to be approved for and receive Level A or medical maintenance. The Medical Foster Care Assessment, CS-10, serves as a referral for medical foster care. Children who are referred for Level A maintenance will follow the local procedures that apply when foster children are referred to this program. These forms are to be completed by the adoptive/guardianship family, with help from staff if needed, and signed by a supervisor. The Division Director will need to approve all above standard maintenance payments via the subsidy Agreement, prior to any payment being authorized. When children need a Level A maintenance rate to meet their special needs, the adoptive parent(s)/guardian(s) are required to attend Level A foster parenting classes. Training must be completed prior to payment of the above standard rate. No back payments to the date of placement will be approved. For families who live out of state, 18 hours of equivalent training may be substituted. The family will need to provide the worker with the curriculum from the training they plan to receive. The worker will review this information with their supervisor to determine the appropriateness of the training. Adoption/guardianship subsidy will reimburse the out-of-state adoptive parent(s)/guardian(s) for training up to $90.00 per hour if there is a charge. This charge must be approved on the subsidy Agreement prior to reimbursement and a receipt provided. Children receiving above base maintenance rates are not eligible for the incentive payment for charting that is provided through the Youth with Elevated Needs-Level A foster care program. Families of children receiving the medical maintenance rate must undergo individualized medical training by the child’s health care provider, which is individualized to the child’s specific health care needs. The health care provider who provides the training must provide documentation of this training. As of July 31, 2002, Youth with Elevated Needs-Level B rates were no longer approved in new subsidy Agreements. Families who are currently receiving Level B maintenance on their subsidy contract as approved prior to July 31, 2002, are not required to undergo yearly reviews, and may be automatically approved to age 18, unless the parent/guardian agrees to reduce the maintenance amount. Above Base Maintenance may be approved for up to two years at a time or up to the child’s 18th birthday, if it is determined that the child’s condition will not improve and/ or that the adoptive/guardianship family will not be in agreement to lowering the maintenance amount as the maintenance rate may not be reduced without the consent of the adoptive parent(s)/guardian(s). In the case of medical subsidy where the medical condition of the child is permanent as indicated by documentation from medical professionals, medical subsidy should be approved to age 18 as the condition is not expected to improve.

"MO :: Section 4, Chapter 9 (Adoption And Guardianship Process), Subsection 6 – Subsidizing An Adoption/Legal Guardianship :: 9.6.4 Nonrecurring Adoption Or Legal Guardianship Expenses",Missouri,Rules,"2023, 2022","Administrative process, Adoption, Legal process, Placement, Reporting requirements, Subsidies - Other",,,"These different types of nonrecurring expenses should be listed individually. The expenses should be reasonable and customary. All receipts submitted for reimbursement must be submitted within 6 months of the service being provided: Nonrecurring placement related expenses (NROT) may be reimbursed up to $1,000.00 and are limited to: Pre-placement transportation: This expense is paid at the current customary rate established by the Children’s Division for use of a personal automobile, or the charge of air or ground transportation; and Lodging and food: Reimbursed using Division travel guidelines for both in-state and out-of-state travel. Private agency fee reimbursement up to $3,500.00 is allowed. Such costs may include the adoption study, including health and psychological examination, and supervision of the placement prior to adoption finalization. Payment for nonrecurring expenses does not include those paid for or provided through resources available to the adoptive parent(s) or guardian(s), court or the agency facilitating the placement. Examples of these resources include: A private agency waives the cost of the family assessment (home study) or the placement support services; The family claimed the Missouri adoption tax credit for nonrecurring adoption expenses; The family has private insurance providing payment for certain services included in an adoption/guardianship; and A service provider has waived the cost for the service. Nonrecurring Adoption Expenses for Special Needs Children NOT Eligible for the Missouri Adoption Subsidy. The U.S. Tax Reform Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-514) requires states to assist adoptive parent(s) with payment of nonrecurring adoption expenses of up to $2000.00 related to the adoption of a special needs child. This attachment provides staff with procedures to follow for children not eligible for the Missouri Adoption Subsidy Program (MASP). This attachment will primarily be used for independent or inter-state adoptions. It is not necessary for the child to have been in the custody of the Children’s Division (CD), Department of Mental Health (DMH), Division of Youth Services (DYS) or a child-placing agency to qualify for payment of nonrecurring adoption expenses. If the child is eligible for MASP, refer to this chapter and Attachments A and B for instructions. As in MASP, stepparent and international adoptions are not eligible for this service. Payment of nonrecurring adoption expenses only for eligible children can be made when the following criteria are met: The adoptive parent(s) must apply for payment and sign an agreement with the Division. The agreement must be approved by the Director or Designee before the adoption is final; The child must meet all the eligibility requirements (as described in this attachment); The adoptive parent(s) must provide documentation that the expenses claimed were incurred by the adoptive parent(s); The adoptive parent(s) must not have received payment or credit from other sources for these expenses; i.e., employee benefits, the Missouri Adoption Tax Credit, and other public or private funds; and The Division will not pay nonrecurring expenses which exceed $2000.00 per child. The amount exceeding the limit for which the Division makes payment may be eligible for the Missouri Adoption Tax Credit. The adoptive parent(s) should be referred to the Missouri Internal Revenue Service for this determination. Juvenile and Circuit Courts are expected to refer the adoptive parent(s) to the Children’s Division office in the adoptive parents’ county/circuit of residence. This referral should occur immediately after the petition is filed. This will allow time for approval before the adoption is final. A Missouri child going to another state may be eligible for payment of these expenses in the receiving state. Contact the ICPC Coordinator, if necessary, for assistance in determining the receiving state’s requirements. Eligibility Criteria for Non-Reoccurring Subsidy Expenses To be determined eligible for payment of nonrecurring adoption expenses, all of the following conditions must be met: (Also, see the Application and Agreement for Payment of Nonrecurring Adoption Expenses, CS-SA-4 and its instructions.): The state has determined that the child should not or cannot be returned to the home of the parents; Documentation: The adoptive parent(s) must provide a copy of the adoption decree. This decree affirms that all appropriate legal steps have been taken and that the adoption was completed according to Missouri law. NOTE: The decree will not be available until after the agreement is signed and the adoption is granted. Staff should explain that this copy will be needed when the family submits the request for payment (2nd page of the CS-SA-4). It must be received before any payment is made. The state has determined that: A specific factor (special need) exists for the child and because of this it is reasonable to conclude the child cannot be placed without a subsidy; Documentation: The child meets this eligibility factor if the child meets any of the MASP special needs criteria. When the child’s special need or condition is not readily observable, documentation must be provided via a statement from the child’s physician, and/or an educational, psychological or psychiatric evaluation. A reasonable but unsuccessful effort has been made to place the child without a subsidy: An effort to locate a family who would not need a subsidy was unsuccessful and there was no “readily available family.” A family is “readily available” when the agency or person responsible for the child’s adoptive placement did not need to make an effort to locate a family who would adopt without financial assistance. Efforts to locate a family who would not need financial assistance do not include those situations in which a child is “found” for a family; i.e., a family is ready to accept a child recruited for them. For example, most foreign children entering this country for adoption must have a family ready to accept them. Applying this principle makes the child ineligible although the child meets the other eligibility requirements. Documentation: The family must provide documentation through a written description of the efforts made by an intermediary to locate a family who would not need a subsidy. This written description must be signed by the intermediary or a representative of the agency or organization acting as an intermediary. An intermediary is a person or agency who arranges the child’s placement between the birth parents and the prospective adoptive parent(s). A reasonable, but unsuccessful, search for a family who would not need a subsidy is not required if the adoptive parent(s) was a licensed resource provider for the child and it is in the best interest of the child to be adopted by this family. Documentation: The family must provide documentation that they provided foster/kinship care to the child immediately before filing the adoption petition. The placement and the adoption are in accordance with state adoption laws. Documentation: The family must provide a copy of the decree of adoption after the adoption is granted. Payment Criteria The Application and Agreement for Payment of Nonrecurring Adoption Expenses, CS-SA-4 is used as the application and to obtain payment. Upon determination that the child is eligible, the family is eligible for payment based on the following requirements: Total payment for all nonrecurring adoption expenses shall not exceed $2,000 per child. All expenses must be reasonable and customary for the services provided. If expenses included in the application appear extraordinary, staff should obtain Regional Office approval for any of these expenses. Nonrecurring adoption expenses are defined as: Court filing fees; Publication fee; Attorney fee; Guardian ad Litem fee; according to 453.020 RSMo, the GAL may be awarded a reasonable fee for such services to be sent by the court. The court, in its discretion, may award such fees as a judgment to be paid by any party to the proceedings or from public funds. Such an award of GAL fees shall constitute a final judgment in favor of the GAL. Other expenses incurred by the adoptive parent(s) which are directly related to the child’s adoption and limited to: •The adoptive family assessment (adoptive home study), including health and psychological examinations, if necessary for the assessment and required by the private agency; Placement supervision before final adoption; and transportation, food and lodging for the adoptive parent(s) and the child when necessary to complete a child’s placement or adoption. Documentation must be provided by the adoptive parent(s) through a stamped “paid receipt,” a cancelled check, or money order receipt, invoice or other material, which verifies he/she incurred and has paid the expense. Limitations: Transportation: This expense is paid at the current rate established by the Children’s Division for use of a personal automobile, or the actual charge of air or ground transportation. Lodging and food: Reimbursed at the amount paid for by the adoptive parent(s). The state travel guidelines should be used to judge the reasonableness of the costs. Legal (attorney, court, publication and GAL fees): This expense is paid at the rate paid by the adoptive parent(s). Attorney fees up to $100.00 per hour may be reimbursed to the family with the maximum reimbursement amount being $1,500.00 per child in uncontested and up to $3,000 in contested matters. Health or psychological examinations, if required for the adoptive family assessment by the private agency. This will be paid at a reasonable and customary rate. Adoption Agency Fees: This expense will be included at the amount paid. Eligible nonrecurring adoption expenses do not include those paid for or provided through resources available to the adoptive parent(s), court or the agency facilitating the placement. Examples of these resources include: •A private agency waives the cost of the adoptive family assessment (home study) or the placement support services; The family claimed the Missouri Adoption Tax Credit for nonrecurring adoption expenses; The family has private insurance providing payment for certain services included in an adoption; and A service provider has waived the cost for the service. Payment Procedure for Non-Recurring Expenses Receive a referral from the court or inquiry from the family; Explain the program to the family and provide a CS-SA-4; Receive the CS-SA-4 from the adoptive parent(s); Receive a completed CS-SA-4 from the private adoption agency, DYS, or DMH; Set up the case record in the name of the adoptive parent(s); Assist the applicant(s) or the other agency in obtaining any required documentation, if necessary; Follow the CS-SA-4 instructions to review and approve or reject the application: For court referrals, provide the adoptive parent(s) an opportunity to correct or add any information; If the application is rejected, inform the family verbally and in writing utilizing the Notification Letter for Adoption and Guardianship Subsidy Denials, CD-87 which includes the following: The reasons for the rejection; The right to appeal the decision through a fair hearing; and Instructions on how to file an appeal. If a fair hearing request is received a copy is to be sent to Division of Legal Services. Submit approved CS-SA-4 to the Contract Management Unit (CMU); CMU will obtain the Division Director’s signature and approval, enter the contract number, and return the original to the county/circuit office; After the adoption is final, the adoptive parent(s) must complete the “Request for Payment of Nonrecurring Adoption Expenses” section of the CS-SA-4 and submit it to the county/circuit office for approval. Once approved, the worker will assure appropriate receipts and invoices are received and then complete a CS-65 sending it and an Inter-Office Communication (IOC) to the Children’s Services Payment Unit (CSPU) indicating that a copy of the final adoption decree is on file in the county/circuit office. Staff will complete the Children’s Services Integrated Payment System Invoice, CS-65 for these services as indicated in the CS-65 instructions. At no time should the “Other” code be used. CSIPS will automatically pay nonrecurring expenses through the Title IV-E fund category; When making a payment to a vendor other than the adoptive parent(s), it is necessary to use that vendor’s Departmental Vendor Number (DVN) or assign a DVN to such vendors. Briefly record all action related to processing the CS-SA-4 in the narrative section of the subsidy file; File copies of the CS-65s, which indicate payment was made, in the case record or the county/circuit office’s business files when received; Contact the adoptive parent(s) or the other agency to inform them that payment has been made or will be made; Close the record when all necessary action is complete; File the record in a designated section in the closed files and retain for five (5) years after the date payment is authorized.

"MO :: Section 4, Chapter 9 (Adoption And Guardianship Process), Subsection 6 – Subsidizing An Adoption/Legal Guardianship :: 9.6.3.1 Subsidy Basic Package",Missouri,Rules,"2023, 2022","Adoption, Guardianship, Legal process, Placement, Subsidies - Other",,,"All children who are adopted or children who are placed for legal guardianship with an eligible relative or qualified close nonrelated person through the Children’s Division are eligible for the following basic subsidy services: Maintenance (daily living expenses including room and board, clothing and incidentals) at standard rate to age 18. At the time of placement, no payment may exceed the maintenance rate paid if the child had remained in out-of-home care, even when used in combination with other benefits available to the child. Standard maintenance Agreements should be written to expire on the last day of the month of the child’s 18th birthday. Medical and Youth with Elevated Needs-Level A maintenance are approved according to the Above Base Maintenance Section in this chapter. At the time of placement, the amount paid is determined by information obtained from the family as to what financial assistance they need to meet the needs of the child and the resources available to the child such as OASDI, VA or SSI, etc. The purpose of maintenance is to contribute toward those items as defined in Section 4 Chapter 11 (room and board, clothing and incidentals). The definition of maintenance should be explained to the adoptive or guardianship family at the time of negotiation of a new subsidy. In the event that a child becomes eligible for OASDI due to the adoptive parent’s /guardian’s disability after adoption or guardianship, the family may receive both. MO HealthNet coverage to meet the healthcare needs of the child to age 18 or maximum of age 21 on a yearly negotiated 18 and above Agreement. A child, eligible for adoption subsidy IV-E, adoption subsidy-HDN, SSI, or guardianship subsidy is automatically eligible for MO HealthNet within the policy and procedural requirements of this program. This eligibility is included in the Agreement. Services covered by MO HealthNet do not require special approval in the service section of the Agreement. <p”>In the MO HealthNet program, a child who has an adoption/legal guardianship subsidy monthly maintenance payment may be eligible for a MO HealthNet vendor payment (which includes daily living expenses and an allowance for personal incidentals). Vendor payments are made to a facility providing 24-hour care, such as a regional diagnostic center, nursing home, convalescent center, etc. If so, the maintenance payment from adoption/legal guardianship subsidy will be counted against the MO HealthNet vendor payment on a dollar-for-dollar basis. It is to the family’s advantage to allow MO HealthNet to use the entire vendor payment and drop maintenance from the Agreement. Families may have expenses relating to support of a child’s placement in a MO HealthNet contracted facility. These may be negotiated and included in the Adoption Subsidy Agreement, CD AD, or the Subsidized Guardianship Agreement, CD SG as a special expense to support the family relationship. Payment will not be made from Division funds to supplement payment made from MO HealthNet, except in certain extreme circumstances, determined on a case-by-case basis. Important MO HealthNet procedural requirements include: A Third Party Resource Form, TPL-1, must be submitted to MO HealthNet Division (MHD) by the worker as soon as the child is eligible for coverage under the adoptive parent(s) or guardian(s)’ private insurance. The information needed for this form is located on the family’s insurance card. The child’s inclusion in the family’s private insurance will usually occur at the time of the final decree of adoption or granting of the guardianship. Some policies may exclude eligibility for the child with a pre-existing condition. In this instance, the child’s needs will be covered by MO HealthNet within the limitations of this program. Families are not required to add their adopted or guardianship children to their private insurance, although it is encouraged. Payment for an insurance premium as prescribed by their private health insurance plan is the responsibility of the adoptive parent(s)/guardian(s). Medicaid can be used as the secondary insurance.  However, non-Medicaid services are the responsibility of the adoptive parent(s)/guardian(s). If a family has added the adopted or guardianship child to their private health insurance, they must use their private health insurance, if the child is covered in their policy, before using MO HealthNet. However, the family must indicate to the provider that the child is also eligible for MO HealthNet. Showing the card and informing the provider of MO HealthNet eligibility should prevent the provider from charging for services above the MO HealthNet rates. Providers will bill the adoptive parent(s)’ or guardian(s)’ insurance company for payment before they bill MO HealthNet for payment. If full payment is not made by the private insurer, MO HealthNet may be billed. MO HealthNet will then pay any balance of service charges within their allowable rates for the specific service. If a balance of charges remains, the provider may not bill the adoptive parent(s)/guardian(s) for the service, except in certain allowable circumstances. Adoptive parent(s) and guardian(s) should be made aware of the HIPP-Health Insurance Premium Payment Program through the MO HealthNet Division. This program pays the cost of health insurance premiums, coinsurances and deductibles. The program pays for health insurance for MO HealthNet eligible persons when it is cost effective for the state. Information about this program or the HIPP-1 application may be obtained from Family Support Division, or by calling the HIPP Unit at (573) 751-2005. You may write to them at: Third Party Liability Unit HIPP Section PO Box 6500 Jefferson City, MO 65102-6500 MO HealthNet providers must be utilized whenever possible. The Division acknowledges that specific circumstances/conditions may arise that require payment to be made for care not covered by MO HealthNet. Medically necessary orthodontic services when a MO HealthNet provider is not geographically accessible (over 100 miles round trip), or not paid entirely by private insurance may be included in an Agreement and approved up to the amount MO HealthNet would pay for the same service. These approvals are obtained through a prior approval process through the MO HealthNet Division and a MO HealthNet consultant. The MO HealthNet consultant must review and certify requested services as eligible for prior approval to be given. If prior approval is not obtained prior to the orthodontic treatment being completed the family will be financially responsible for treatment costs. The following information is required for prior approval through a MO HealthNet consultant in the approval of orthodontia: A statement from the Orthodontist recommending the procedure and providing the following information: Orthodontic records that consist of cephalometric x-ray, panoramic x-ray or full-mouth survey in addition to dental study models, properly occluded and trimmed; and A diagnosis and prognosis which includes an itemized listing with the procedural codes and an estimate of the number of months treatment will be required; Documentation regarding the lack of accessible MO HealthNet orthodontic providers within the area where the family resides; A letter from a Physician which indicates the treatment is medically necessary; and Documentation of all other sources explored: the family’s insurance and community resources. This information should be sent to the Adoption/Guardianship Program Development Specialist in Central Office, who will review the packet of required information and if all required documentation has been submitted, will forward the packet to MO HealthNet Division. If the required documents are not enclosed, the packet will be returned to the worker. The MO HealthNet Division will have the information reviewed by the State Orthodontic Consultant, who will determine if the procedure is medically necessary and would be reimbursable through MO HealthNet, if a MO HealthNet provider were available. Notice of this review and the consultant’s worksheet, will be sent back to local staff. If the request for orthodontics is denied, the orthodontist may bill for an office visit, x-rays, and diagnostic casts. These costs may be approved for reimbursement by amendment to the subsidy Agreement. If the request for orthodontics is approved, the amount indicated as acceptable through the MO HealthNet program and as indicated on the consultant’s worksheet may be added to the subsidy Agreement by amendment. Families should be advised that “Orthodontics is only for the most handicapping malocclusions. A handicapping malocclusion is a condition that constitutes a hazard to the maintenance of oral health and interferes with the well-being of the patient by causing impaired mastication, dysfunction of the temporomandibular articulation, susceptibility to periodontal disease, susceptibility to dental caries and impaired speech due to malposition of the teeth.” “Assessment of the most handicapping malocclusion is determined by the magnitude of the following variables:  degree of malalignment, missing teeth, angle classification, overjet, overbite, openbite and crossbite.” NOTE: Requests for services for cosmetic purposes will not receive approval. Emergency care not covered under MO HealthNet or private insurance which is less than $500.00 may be included on an amendment to the contract without prior authorization. The evaluation and recommendation of MO HealthNet Division must be secured for charges over $500.00. This approval is obtained by submitting the invoice and treatment summary to the Adoption/Guardianship Program Development Specialist in Central Office who will forward the information to the MO HealthNet Division for review, evaluation and recommendation. Upon receipt of the recommendation, the local office will be notified and if approved the amount may be included on an amendment to the Agreement and approved by the Division Director. Child Care to age 13 as long as both parent(s)/guardian(s) or the single parent/guardian is working. Child Care Services are regulated by Early Childhood and Prevention Services. Child care policy is available at the Child Care Policy Manual Web site on the Children’s Division Intranet. A subsidy Agreement may include childcare services as a part of the basic subsidy package for children up to age thirteen (13) when both parent(s)/guardian(s) are working. Childcare is to be included on the Adoption Subsidy or Subsidized Guardianship Agreement as service code DAYC. In the maximum amount box the words, “State Contracted Rate” are to be entered. In the explanation section the statement, ”Childcare may be approved at the state contracted rate to age 13 when both parents/guardians are working. Payment may only be made to licensed/contracted or registered providers” must be included. Due to the extreme needs of some children covered by subsidy agreements, exceptions may be made for childcare payment authorizations for children over age 13, and outside the eligibility of approval for childcare through the Office of Early Childhood. These requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Requests for exceptions must be sent to the Adoption/Guardianship Program Development Specialist in Central Office accompanied by verification of the child’s special need, which includes a statement from a physician or mental health professional explaining why childcare is required. A statement regarding the parent(s)/guardian(s) inability to locate community programs to assist with supervision of the child, a statement including the hours of care needed per day/week, and anticipated duration of care shall be included in these requests. Contracted childcare facilities receive financial incentives for providing care to special needs children. These incentives are automatically generated to the provider when a child is authorized through the SEAS system, or when a Children’s Services Integrated Payment System Invoice, CS-65, is entered using childcare service codes. These incentives and their service codes are as follows: SPND – Special Needs. This incentive is paid whenever a child has been in the custody of the Division. All children who are adopted/under a guardianship Agreement qualify for this incentive payment if they are being cared for by a licensed/contracted or registered provider. The payment system automatically generates a payment which is 25% over the total cost for the month the child was in childcare. For instance, if the child’s total childcare bill is $300.00, the provider will automatically receive a payment of $75.00 in addition to the $300.00 they charged. Other incentives may be available to the childcare facility based on their qualifications. These incentives will be automatically calculated into the “State contracted rate.” Contracted services are authorized using the SEAS Request and Eligibility Form, CS-67, and SEAS Authorization Form, CS-67A, completed in the county/circuit of the child’s residence by the authorizing worker. Approval from the authorizing designee must be received. The CS-67 and CS-67A will be completed and entered into SEAS after a provider is located and a referral completed. After entry of the CS-67 and CS-67A, both the provider and the adoptive or guardianship family will receive system-generated notifications detailing the childcare authorized. The Services Eligibility and Authorization Provider Invoice, CS-65A, will be generated by the system directly to the provider(s) for all authorized services. Upon receipt of the Services Eligibility and Authorization Provider Invoice, CS-65A, it will be the responsibility of the county payment designee to check the invoice for completeness, reasonableness, and accuracy. The system will not allow payment for rates that exceed those specified in the provider’s contract. Childcare expenses reimbursed on a Children’s Services Integrated Payment System Invoice, CS-65, for registered childcare must use the service codes ASDC (Adoption Subsidy childcare) and LGDC (Legal Guardianship Childcare) and will not be affected by the incentive payments, DISP and ACRD. Respite services for all levels will be approved to the end of the month of the 18 th birthday. Adoptive or guardianship families may receive respite as a basic service. All paid receipts submitted for reimbursement must be submitted on the Respite Provider Payment Invoice for Adoptive/Guardianship Parents (CD-262) form within 6 months of the service being provided. Respite units may only be approved according to the child’s level of maintenance. One unit is a time period of between 12 – 24 hours. A half unit is a time period of between 6 – 12 hours. The following eligibility rates apply: Base Maintenance is 12 units at $25.00 per unit-maximum of $300, or $12.50 per half unit. Above Base Maintenance is 19 units at approximately $26.25 per unit-maximum of $498.75 or additional units as approved or $13.13 per half unit. (The daily rate of maintenance they receive. Level B respite units may only be approved for contracts that have Level B maintenance that was approved prior to July 31, 2002. Respite on these contracts is approved for 24 units at $40.00 per unit. There are no two-week vacations approved through subsidy as are available to Level B Resource Providers. Level B respite will not be approved as a new service. Legal Attorney Fees at $100.00 per hour and court fees. In adoption cases, the maximums are up to $1,500.00 in non-contested cases, and $3,000.00 in contested cases. In guardianship cases, the maximum legal expense per guardianship is $2000 in non-contested as well as contested cases. This is a nonrecurring expense and include the entitlement of GAL fees per 453.025 RSMo. According to 453.025 RSMo, the GAL may be awarded a reasonable fee for such services to be sent by the court. The court, in its discretion, may award such fees as a judgment to be paid by any party to the proceedings or from public funds. Such an award of GAL fees shall constitute a final judgment in favor of the GAL. Legal fees include attorney’s fees, court costs, publication expenses, and Guardian Ad Litem (GAL) costs for the adoptive parent(s) or guardian(s) in adoption or the guardianship case filed in a court of competent jurisdiction. The payment is intended to aid in the development, adjustment and continuity of the formation of the “new” family created by adoption or legal guardianship. Significant to the use of an adoption/legal guardianship subsidy is the realization that without this resource a family would not otherwise have the resources to provide permanency to a special needs child. NOTE: Adoptive parent(s) may decline any or all of these services; guardian(s) may decline services as well, however are required to receive maintenance of at least one dollar. In the event that services are declined, the parent(s) or guardian(s) must sign a dated statement indicating specifically which services they are declining. This statement is to be filed in the subsidy record and documented in the explanation section of the agreement. Basic services declined cannot be approved at a future date. All basic subsidy services must be addressed in the explanation section in some manner.

For the Division to subsidize an adoption or legal guardianship, the adoptive parent(s) or guardian(s) must sign an Agreement. This Agreement will cover only those services for which the Division has agreed to pay. In many instances services may be purchased only from a provider with whom the Division has a contract. In other instances a child’s needs may require a service that is not available from a provider with whom the Division has a contract. Such services must be included in the Agreement and approved by the Division Director prior to the services being utilized. These services will be reimbursed to the adoptive parent(s) or guardian(s) or, whenever possible, a child-specific contract will be developed with the service provider to allow payment to the provider directly from the Division. Subsidy agreements are to be signed only by the adoptive parent(s)/guardian(s) and the DFAS Director/DFAS Designee. In the event that a two parent family has an active foster home license/contract, but only one parent will be pursuing guardianship/adoption; only the guardian/parent pursing guardianship/adoption will sign the subsidy agreement. Both names, however, will remain on the DVN and in FACES for the duration of the foster care period.  Once the guardianship/adoption finalizes, the second parent will need to be removed from the DVN and the foster care license/contract closed.  IF both parents are continuing to foster other children together or have an active subsidy, a new DVN will need to be created for the one parent on the guardianship/adoption subsidy. A new AD approval will need to be added under the new DVN for the adoptive parent/guardian to be associated with the guardianship/adoption subsidy. If the parent with the primary tax ID in FACES is the one who needs to be removed from the DVN, it can only be removed by the payment unit.  This can be completed by emailing your request to DFAS.FACESPaymentUnit@dss.mo.gov. Payment for services included in the Agreement must not begin until the DFAS Director/DFAS Designeehas signed the Agreement. Providers will be reimbursed directly if they have a contract with the Division. Adoptive parent(s) or guardian(s) will be paid for the service after an invoice or a “paid” receipt has been submitted. All receipts submitted for reimbursement must be submitted within 6 months of the service being provided. Payment for maintenance, MO HealthNet, childcare, respite and other special services are authorized through an adoption or guardianship subsidy Agreement. There is to be no means test utilized in developing these Agreements. Adoption and legal guardianship Agreements may continue until the child reaches age 18. All subsidy Agreements are reviewed by staff at least annually to insure best services to children and families are provided, and more frequently at the request of the family when changes are necessary because of the needs of the child/youth. Additionally, this Division assists the Division of Youth Services (DYS), the Department of Mental Health (DMH) and licensed child-placing agencies by authorizing an adoption or legal guardianship subsidy for eligible children who are in their custody and are placed for adoption or guardianship. These children must meet eligibility requirements for the subsidy programs. It must be remembered that, although there may be a subsidy in place, the family is an adoptive or guardianship family. Therefore, we must recognize that the family, like other families, has the same rights and responsibilities to manage their own lives and that of their child after the final decree of adoption or legal guardianship is granted. The family, like other families, may utilize any appropriate community service or resource (including the Division) to assist with service needs which develop at a later time. However, with the Division’s commitment to seek permanency for children with special needs through adoption or legal guardianship, it is recognized that families providing permanency for these children may need placement support services beyond the granting of a decree of adoption or legal guardianship. We are to extend to these families our assistance to make the adoption or legal guardianship a success. The family should be informed that staff will be available to provide needed and appropriate services, i.e., the family may request additional adoption or guardianship support services be added to their subsidy any time after the decree of adoption or legal guardianship. The adoption subsidy and subsidized guardianship Agreements are contracts and are considered legally binding. Because these documents are contracts and are legally binding, no pencil, white out, or other alterations may be made in the pre-printed template of the Agreement. In the event that a requested service entered on the Agreement or any Amendment is not approved by the Division Director or the amount of payment is changed, or a correction needs to be made, the change may be handled by “crossing out” the item, writing in the change and requesting the adoptive parent(s)/guardian(s) to initial the change and date their initials. If more than one change must be made on the Agreement or Amendment, a new Agreement or Amendment will need to be prepared and signatures obtained again. NOTE: changes of any kind cannot be made to the pre-printed template contents or the four pages of the adoption subsidy agreement, cd ad. Scanned copies of the Agreement will only be accepted by the Adoption Subsidy Unit with prior approval and must be legible. NOTE: the adoption subsidy agreement and legal guardianship agreement must be approved by the division director or designee prior to the final decree of adoption or award of legal guardianship.

At the time of planning for adoption or legal guardianship, the child must meet one of the following circumstances: Be in the custody of the Children’s Division. Children in the care and custody of the Children’s Division are considered special needs, and are in turn automatically eligible for Missouri Adoption Subsidy; OR Be in the custody of a child-placing agency licensed in accordance with sections 210.481-210.531 RSMo, the Division of Youth Services (DYS), or the Department of Mental Health (DMH) or child with special needs. Special needs child placed in Missouri through a private child-placing agency and is Title IV-E. Missouri is required by federal rule to provide adoption subsidy to these children. A Missouri IV-E Eligibility Analyst must determine the fund code eligibility. It is the responsibility of the private agency to obtain the necessary documentation for the Eligibility Analyst. If the child is not IV-E eligible, Missouri is not responsible for subsidy coverage. Children who have a subsequent adoption because of the dissolution of their adoption or the death of their adoptive parents continue to be eligible for assistance under Title IV-E or Missouri funded subsidy in a subsequent adoption if they were previously eligible. If payment of medical expenses is not included in the subsidy, the adoptive parent(s) is financially responsible for their child’s medical expenses. Ineligible Children for Missouri Adoption or Legal Guardianship Subsidy The following children are ineligible for Missouri Adoption and Legal Guardianship Subsidy: Children in a subsequent guardianship if the legal guardian was not named the successor guardian in the initial or amended agreement and; Children who did not re-enter foster care prior to the establishment of a subsequent guardianship. Children being adopted internationally or children adopted from other states who are not IV-E eligible and in the custody of a private child-placing agency; Children in the custody of Missouri juvenile courts even though they may receive a payment while in other types of out-of-home care; Step-parent adoptions; Step-parent guardians. Ineligible Placements for Missouri Adoption and Legal Guardianship Subsidy Felony Convictions Staff may not approve the adoption or guardianship subsidy application of any person in which a record check has revealed a felony conviction for child abuse or neglect, spousal abuse, a crime against children (including child pornography), or a crime involving violence, including rape, sexual assault, or homicide, but not including other physical assault or battery as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. Staff may also not approve the application of any person who in the past five years has had a court of competent jurisdiction determine a felony conviction for physical assault, battery, or a drug-related offense. For the purpose of this policy, a “felony conviction by a court of competent jurisdiction” is defined as a criminal court conviction for a felony offense as defined by law in the jurisdiction that the offense took place. In the unlikely event that it is determined that the best interest of a child would be served by providing subsidy in a IV-E ineligible placement setting, written approval must be obtained through supervisory lines to the Regional Office. The Regional Office must review the request and, if in agreement, forward with their recommendation to the Deputy Director for Children’s Division for final consideration. Written requests should include a thorough description of the applicant’s situation and why it would be in the child’s best interest for an exception to be granted. If approved by the Deputy Director, IV-E funding may not be used for the adoption subsidy and the Children’s Service Worker will be responsible for notifying the Eligibility Analyst who will ensure that state-only funds are used. Federal funds may not be used for adoption assistance payments if any of the aforementioned conditions exist. It is imperative that in those circumstances the Children’s Service Worker notify the Eligibility Analyst who will enter the correct fund code for state-only funding.

"MO :: Section 4, Chapter 9 (Adoption And Guardianship Process), Subsection 6 – Subsidizing An Adoption/Legal Guardianship :: Intro",Missouri,Rules,"2023, 2022","Adoption, Legal process, Subsidies - Other",,,"An adoption subsidy is available to a child who is designated as having special needs (section 453.065, RSMo) and who does not have an adoptive family readily available. Guardianship subsidy is available to a qualified relative or qualified close nonrelated people (section 453.072, RSMo) who are granted legal guardianship of the child in the same manner as such subsidies are available for adoptive parents. Subsidies are available to children in the care of the Children’s Division, Division of Youth Services, Department of Mental Health and licensed child-placing agencies at the time of placement for guardianship or adoption. Adoption subsidy services may be used to assist in providing permanency for children through adoption who, because of their special needs, might not otherwise be adopted, and for whom a family is not readily available. Subsidized guardianship services may be used to assist any grandparent, aunt, uncle, adult sibling of the child, adult first cousin of the child, or any other person, whose life is so intermingled with the child such that the relationship is similar to a family relationship; who has obtained legal guardianship for eligible children. Legal Basis and Funding Source The Missouri Adoption Subsidy Program is authorized by sections 453.065, 453.073 and 453.074, RSMo, and permits the Division to make subsidy payments on behalf of eligible special needs children to adoptive families to cover maintenance, medical and dental care, and other special expenses. This program was first effective September 28, 1973. Legislation passed by the 83rd General Assembly and effective September 28, 1985, authorized the Division to use adoption subsidy funds also for children in the custody of the Department of Mental Health (DMH) and the Division of Youth Services (DYS) at the time of their placement for adoption. This legislation also clarified that children in the custody of a dually licensed private child-placing agency are eligible for an adoption subsidy. A subsidy authorized for such children uses Division adoption subsidy appropriations and Division guidelines to administer the program. Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, modified through the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-272), authorized Federal Financial Participation (FFP) in an adoption subsidy if the child, while in the custody of the Children’s Division, was eligible for IV-E alternative care. Also, this eligibility automatically causes the child to be eligible for the Missouri Medical/Dental Services (MO HealthNet) program. Children, eligible for SSI and covered by an adoption subsidy Agreement, are also eligible for MO HealthNet. The Consolidated Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (COBRA), also known as P.L. 99-272, authorized several amendments to Titles IV-E and XIX of the Social Security Act, effective October 1, 1986. These amendments permit the child who is eligible for adoption subsidy IV-E to receive Title XIX (MO HealthNet) and Title XX services in the state of residence as long as there is an adoption subsidy Agreement in place with the original state of residence. Also, these amendments eliminated the requirement that a Title IV-E child must receive a maintenance payment to receive MO HealthNet. The Missouri legislature enacted legislation, effective September 28, 1985, permitting the Division to become a signatory state to the Interstate Compact for Adoption and Medical Assistance (ICAMA). Missouri became a signatory state in January 1986. For the member states, this compact authorized the IV-E child to receive medical assistance through Medicaid from the resident state. The intent is to assure that no break occurs in the child’s receipt of medical assistance when the child moves to another state. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-514) also authorized, effective January 1, 1987, payment for maintenance for eligible Title IV-E children to begin with the date of placement as long as there is an adoption subsidy Agreement signed by the Division Director. This amendment to Title IV-E of the Social Security Act eliminated the previous requirement that eligible children be in the custody of the adoptive parent(s) for the purpose of adoption to use Title IV-E funds. P.L. 99-514 requires states to pay certain nonrecurring expenses of all special needs children who meet the eligibility requirements. The Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) of 1997 requires that state medical assistance coverage or MO HealthNet is provided for children who have a state-funded adoption assistance agreement. A child who has been determined by the state to have special medical, mental health or rehabilitative need cannot be placed for adoption without medical assistance. This is also part of the requirement for waiver demonstration incentive payments. Funding for the Division’s program is derived from three (3) sources: Appropriations made from Missouri’s general revenue; Appropriations authorized through Title IV-E of the Social Security Act; and Appropriations authorized under Title XIX of the Social Security Act. Other possible funding sources for a subsidy plan are Veteran’s Assistance (VA) administered by the U.S. Veteran’s Administration, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and the Old Age Survivors and Dependents Insurance (OASDI) programs administered by the federal Social Security Administration (SSA). In rare instances, a specific child may have other sources of income that will follow the child into adoption. The Legal Guardianship Subsidy Program is authorized by Missouri legislation. Senate Bill 1 was effective August 28, 1999. The Foster Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act HR6893 effective October 1, 2008 modified Title IV-E of the Social Security Act authorizing Federal Financial Participation (FFP) in guardianship subsidy if the child, while in the custody of the Children’s Division, was eligible for IV-E alternative care. The guardianship subsidy program is authorized by 453.072 RSMo, which was modified by Senate Bill 47, which changed the individuals eligible for guardianship subsidy. According to this statute, any subsidies available to adoptive parents pursuant to section 453.073 and section 453.074 shall also be available to a qualified relative of a child or a qualified close nonrelated person who is granted legal guardianship of the child in the same manner as such subsidies are available for adoptive parents. Legal guardianship ends when the youth reaches age 18, therefore the legal guardianship subsidy is only available through a youth’s 18th birthday. As used in this section, “relative” means any grandparent, aunt, uncle, adult sibling, adult first cousin or any other person related to the child by blood or affinity As used in this section, “close nonrelated person” means any nonrelated person whose life is so intermingled with the child such that the relationship is similar to a family relationship. Successor guardian provisions, authorized by P.L. 113-183, were signed into law on September 29, 2014 which amended titles IV-B and IV-E of the Social Security Act. P.L. 113-183 requires continuation of title IV-E guardianship assistance payments if the guardian dies or is incapacitated and a successor legal guardian is named in the agreement or any amendments to the agreement (section 473(d)(3)(C) of the Act).

This goal is to be used when a caregiver plans to become the guardian of a child under the age of 18. As like adoption the priority should be to place siblings together, whenever possible. CD must make reasonable efforts to place siblings in the same placement unless doing so would be contrary to the safety or well-being of any of the siblings. Persons interested in serving as a child’s guardian must file a petition in probate court in accordance with chapter 475, RSMo. If the court makes a determination that the child is a minor or incapable of caring for himself and managing his affairs, a guardian is appointed. The guardian becomes legally responsible and obligated to take care of the child. The guardian must make all necessary decisions regarding the child’s affairs including medical care, education and finances. Also, the guardian is under a duty to provide the child with necessary food, clothing and shelter. The guardian is directly supervised by and answerable to the court which granted the petitioner’s request for guardianship. Children who are 16 years of age or older at the time of the guardianship are eligible for Chafee older youth services, even after the Guardianship is completed. These services shall be monitored by the family subsidy worker. There are two forms of guardianship available to caretakers interested in this permanency option for children. The first is guardianship by a qualified individual. Qualified individuals achieving guardianship may be eligible for guardianship subsidy through the Children’s Division. The second form of guardianship is guardianship – no subsidy. Staff is encouraged to discuss these options with caretakers interested in legal guardianship and to explain the eligibility criteria for subsidy benefits. Staff will also have the responsibility for entering information into FACES appropriately for guardianship in the placement section of FACES. Guidelines for Assessing Guardianship Guardianship should be considered for a child only after both reunification and adoption have been ruled out as feasible options. This option is for children who are under the age of 18 and have an identified caregiver willing to pursue the legal course of Guardianship. If a child has a plan that involves an adult guardianship or conservatorship, the child’s permanency goal is considered to be APPLA (and the child must be 16 years of age or older). A comparison chart has been developed to help facilitate discussion during Family Support Team Meetings regarding the difference between adoption and guardianship. The chart can be found on e-forms listed as Adoption and Guardianship Comparison. The Family Support Team has determined that family reunification is not likely in the foreseeable future and termination of parental rights is deemed inappropriate; Adoption is not an option ; Current placement provider is able to meet the needs of the child including financial; Current placement is stable; The child’s caretaker family is willing to pursue guardianship; The child, if over 14 years of age, consents; The juvenile court having jurisdiction supports guardianship as an option and is willing to terminate its jurisdiction when such is granted; and The child’s Family Support Team is supportive of plan for guardianship. The Division’s legal relationship, as well as services and foster care payments to the child/family, would terminate once guardianship is established, however, support services may continue as needed/desired and available. Procedures for Pursuing Guardianship Discuss prospects of guardianship with the Family Support Team including the child, if age appropriate, birth parent(s) and caretaker(s); If guardianship appears a viable option, the caretaker family should be directed to consult with legal counsel; Once the case plan has changed to guardianship, the Children’s Service Worker responsible for case management should notify the Children’s Service Worker responsible for the subsidy immediately to ensure that the subsidy worker has time to negotiate the Legal Guardianship subsidy agreement prior to the award of guardianship The Children’s Service Worker responsible for the subsidy has the responsibility to meet with the prospective guardian to discuss services available through guardianship subsidy, including the option to name a successor guardian at the time of the initial subsidy agreement or any amendments thereafter For the prospective guardian to be eligible for guardianship subsidy, they must be a qualified relative of the child or a qualified close nonrelated person. A Relative is a grandparent or any other person related to another by blood or affinity or a person who is not so related to the child but has a close relationship with the child or the child’s family; Close nonrelated person, is defined as any nonrelated person whose life is so intermingled with the child such that the relationship is similar to a family relationship. The caretaker family also must comply with all licensing requirements including training, background checks and the home study process. Once a petition for guardianship has been filed, write a letter of recommendation with rationale to probate court and juvenile court and coordinate with courts, if separate, to ensure child is not without a legal custodian during the transition; and Continue with services as needed or desired by family and available through agency. Children age 16 and older are eligible to continue Chafee services once the guardianship is completed. Procedures for Closing Case The following procedures are required by the Children’s Service Worker after the court has issued an Order for Guardianship and the family will not receive a guardianship subsidy: Close necessary functions in FACES such as service authorizations and KIDS account. Ensure all case information in FACES is accurate and updated. Place copy of Order for Guardianship in record. Send family letter advising the case has been closed and offering services if needed by the family in the future. Guardianship Placement Support Supporting a guardianship takes coordination of services and systems designed to help maintain the stability of the placement as well as assisting the family through fiscal benefits. Chafee Services Youth, age 16 and older, are eligible to continue Chafee services once the guardianship is completed. Please refer to Chapter 5 of this section. Family Resource Centers Missouri Resource Parents have the benefit of having Family Resource Center services available. The motivation for these centers is the prevention of disruption in a child’s placement and support to resource families. The centers utilize local and regional partnerships with other agencies providing similar services to maximize the funds available and avoid duplication or gaps in services. Successor Guardian A successor guardian is a person(s) named in the guardianship agreement or amendment who becomes the alternative legal guardian in the event the legal guardian’s death or physically or mentally incapacitation to the point they can no longer care for the child(ren). At the time of initial negotiation of the agreement, staff must discuss and advise the guardian(s) the option to name a successor guardian in the agreement. If the guardian(s) dies or is physically or mentally incapacitated and a successor guardian is not named in the agreement, the child may not be eligible to receive guardianship assistance payments in a subsequent guardianship. If after being advised of the option of naming a successor guardian, the guardian(s) elect not to exercise the option, staff shall document this refusal in the narrative section of the subsidy file. However, the guardians may name a successor guardian or change the named successor at any time the current agreement is active in their name. To assist in this discussion, the Successor Guardian Information letter (CD-222), may be given to the family. This letter may be given to the family, completed, signed and placed in the file. Once completed, this letter should be retained as documentation this discussion occurred and the option was given. The successor guardian must be able to pass all background screenings required by the Children’s Division and the courts. Children who have a subsequent guardianship because of the incapacitation or the death of their guardian(s) may be eligible for assistance under Title IV-E or Missouri funded subsidy in a subsequent guardianship if: They were previously eligible and the successor guardian was named in the agreement or They are placed in the legal custody of the Children’s Division and a new IV-E eligibility determination is completed prior to the establishment of a subsequent guardianship. Fingerprints for successor guardian CD will assume financial responsibility for fingerprints to be completed on the named Successor Guardians in the child’s LG agreement at the time it is determined they will be assuming guardianship of the child. The fingerprints are to be completed at the time the named successor guardian is planning to petition the court to assume guardianship and prior to an approval in FACES being entered. In the event the named successor guardian’s fingerprint results indicate they have a felony conviction for one of the crimes which makes them an ineligible placement for subsidy funding a subsequent LG agreement may not be negotiated. Staff may not approve the adoption or guardianship subsidy application of any person in which a record check has revealed a felony conviction for child abuse or neglect, spousal abuse, a crime against children (including child pornography), or a crime involving violence, including rape, sexual assault, or homicide, but not including other physical assault or battery was determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. Staff may also not approve the application of any person who in the past five years has had a court of competent jurisdiction determine a felony conviction for physical assault, battery, or a drug-related offense.

The work that is facilitated from the beginning can lead to successful adoptive placements throughout the child’s life. Preparing the Child and Adoptive Family for Adoption Adequate preparation of the child is critical to the lasting success of the adoption. The child should be allowed ample time and opportunity to deal with his feelings related to his separation from his current family, i.e., birth and/or foster family. The Children’s Service Worker should engage the child in all stages of the adoption process beginning with identifying the type of family the child would most like to be a part of. Also, the worker should carefully observe the child’s behavior and encourage the child to talk about his perceptions about the adoptive family during the pre-placement phase. Most children will provide clear clues about their readiness and comfort level in proceeding with the adoptive placement. The following is a list of activities the worker should do to ease the child’s transition into the adoptive family’s home: Share information with the child about the adoptive family. Sharing can be in the form of discussion, photographs, videotapes and letters from the family, etc. Give child’s profile of non-identifying information to the adoptive parents and acknowledge receipt by signing and dating the Adoption Placement Summary. Facilitate pre-placement visits between child and adoptive family. The frequency, length and setting will vary based on the child’s age, development and comfort level. Discuss each pre-placement visit with the child, foster family and adoptive family individually. Discuss separation and grief issues and potential behavior problems with the adoptive family. Emphasize the child’s ethnic/cultural needs with the child and family. Encourage child to share/discuss his life book with adoptive family. Encourage the adoptive family to allow the child to talk about the people who have cared for him and those he has cared about in the past. Negotiate with the child and family a plan for post-placement visits for the child with siblings if applicable, foster family and/or significant others. Engage child’s therapist in the placement process. Arrange a closure “good-bye” visit between child and foster parents. Inform adoptive family about available support groups and encourage their participation. If age appropriate inform the child about their right at age 18 to request non-identifying information about their biological parents and adult siblings. If age appropriate inform the child of their right at age 18 to request from the court which finalized the adoption identifying information from their adoption record. If age appropriate inform the child of their right at age 18 to register with the Missouri Adoption Information Registry. Explore with the child about their understanding and acceptance of what has occurred in the past, separation from their birth family and present resource family, their desire for adoption, how they feel about being placed or not being placed with siblings. With the child, continue developing the “Lifebook”, integrating significant events, accumulated memorabilia, birth and medical history. Utilize the current resource family in preparing the child for placement via discussion and participation in the following areas; Feelings toward biological parents Entitlement to a new family Reasons why the child cannot stay with the current resource family Giving the child permission to leave the foster family Obtaining information about the child’s behavior patterns, daily routine, and parenting needs Assist current resource family in making the transition to the permanent adoptive home as thoughtfully as possible taking into account the feelings of the resource provider and the child. Finalizing Adoption through court Proceedings Chapter 453 of Missouri law sets forth the requirements and procedures for the adoption of a child which includes the following provisions: Any person desiring to adopt a child may petition the juvenile division of the circuit court of the county where either the child or family wishing to adopt resides. A Guardian ad Litem will be appointed by the court to represent the child when the child is under 18 years of age. In all cases where the child being adopted is 14 years or older, his written consent to the adoption is required, except where the court finds that the child does not have sufficient mental capacity to do so. No transfer of custody of the child to the petitioner nor a final decree of adoption will be made by the court until a full investigation has been made. This investigation may include, but not be limited to, an adoptive home study on the potential adoptive parent, an investigation as to the child’s readiness and suitability for adoption, and the child’s eligibility for adoption subsidy. “453.077. 1. When a child has been placed with the petitioner for the required six-month placement period, the person conducting the pre-placement assessment of the adoption or other persons authorized to conduct assessments pursuant to section 453.070 shall provide the court with a post-placement assessment. The specific content of which shall be determined by rule by the Department Of Social Services, Children’s Division. The post-placement assessment shall include an update of the pre-placement assessment which was submitted to the court pursuant to section 453.070, and a report on the emotional, physical and psychological status of the child. If an assessment is conducted after August 28, 1997, but prior to the promulgation of rules and regulations by the department concerning the contents of such assessment, any discrepancy between the contents of the actual assessment and the contents of the assessment required by department rule shall not be used as the sole basis for invalidating an adoption.” NOTE:  The format and content of these investigations may vary depending upon the requirements of the local court. Adoptions may be finalized in one of two ways: through a one-count or two-count petition, depending on the interpretation of the statue by the local judicial circuits. A one-count petition is a formal, legal document filed pursuant to chapter 453, RSMo, requesting the adoption of a child by the petitioner. A one-count petition is used when the child has already been placed in the actual (or physical custody) of the petitioner, such as an adoptive placement by the Children’s Division. This usually follows the termination of parental rights. The petition usually requests an adoption decree, and the adoption decree may only be entered after there has been actual custody for a period of at least six (6) months. A one-count petition may also be used in stepparent adoptions and in the more rare adult adoptions. A two-count petition is a formal, legal document which requests in the first count the placement of actual and legal custody of the minor child with the petitioner(s) and, in the second count, requests an order of adoption. Again, the child must be in the lawful and actual custody of the petitioners for a period of six (6) months prior to the entry of an adoption decree. Custody of a child may not be transferred to the adoptive family prior to their filing a petition in the appropriate court. There may be a hearing held for placement of custody, but it is not necessary if all parties agree or stipulate to the placement. A hearing is held, after nine (9) months of actual custody, to ensure that the adoption is in the best interest of the child. Two-count petitions are more likely to be contested because the parental rights of the birth parents have not always been terminated by that time. They may be contested on either or both counts:  placement or adoption. Again, the procedural requirements may vary depending upon the interpretation of the statute by local judicial circuits. To complete the adoption process the worker will: Prepare and submit a written summary to court for transfer of custody hearing and final decree hearing according to local requirements. Assist child and family’s attorney in completing “Agreement to Adoptive Plan” when child has reached 14th birthday if adoption is not finalized before this age. Appear in court for decree of adoption hearing. Make one face-to-face in-home visit with child and family after court hearing for the purpose of: Referral to community support groups, if needed. Reinforcing lifetime commitment of adoption. Maintaining links to any needed rehabilitation services. Reinforcing agency’s commitment to the success of the adoption. Completing subsidized adoption agreement, reminding family of yearly review of subsidy and necessary maintenance activities, if appropriate. Making a final assessment of the child’s safety in the placement. Close case with a closing summary upon receipt of decree of adoption: Maintain active case services if continued services are needed. Maintain subsidy if this service is utilized and record subsidy transactions as needed. Placement Support The primary purpose of support services is to assist the child and new family to become integrated as a family unit. Reciprocal and open communication between the Children’s Service Worker, family and child is essential to identifying the services needed for integration to occur. Children placed in the temporary custody of the adoptive parents remain in the CD’s legal custody. Support services, visitation and timely PPRT meetings should continue until the finalization of the adoption and the court has released the child and CD from jurisdiction. Services should be consistent with the needs of the family and may be provided by the worker and/or through referrals to community resources. The following represents the minimum expectations for worker contact with the adoptive family: Visit face-to-face in the home with the family and child once a week for the first month of placement. Visit face-to-face in the home, at a minimum, once a month thereafter, until the adoption decree is issued. Contact by telephone as needed. Face-to-face in home closure visit with the child and adoptive parent(s) after the adoption has been finalized .Issues which the Children’s Service worker should discuss with the family and child during contacts should include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: That emotional attachment between parent and child is not simultaneous with the physical move. The progressive periods of adjustment for children in placement, i.e., separation and grief, honeymoon, testing, normal child behavior and/or attachment. Adoptive parents normally experience ambivalent feelings, emotional letdowns, and periods of uncertainty. This can be a normal reaction following both crisis and success. The child may respond to each parent in different ways. The adjustment of the child and parents may occur at different rates. The child may compare his present family unfavorably with his former family. The child’s feeling of being safe in the placement. Child’s needs related to his/her cultural/racial background, if different than the adoptive parents. The Children’s Service Worker should continually assess and offer guidance to the family in the development of the parent-child relationship and problems unique to the adoption. The following topics shall be discussed with the family during the worker’s contact with the adoptive parents: Effect of the child’s placement on the marital and family relationship. Child’s adjustment to new school and community. Child’s current behavior and continuation of past behavior and how family is coping with the behavior. Effect of child’s continued contact with foster parents and/or significant others. Availability of resources to assist family in learning about and coping with child’s special needs, i.e., support groups, organizations, community agencies, etc. Family Resource Centers Missouri adoptive parents have the benefit of having Family Resource Center (FRC) services available through Foster & Adoptive Care Coalition , Central Missouri Foster Care and Adoption Association , and Fosteradopt Connect . The purpose for these centers is the prevention of adoption disruption and support to resource families. The centers create and utilize local and regional partnerships with other agencies providing similar services to maximize the resources available and avoid duplication or gaps in services. Adoption Disruption The vast majority of families succeed in establishing permanent homes for children they have adopted. However, in spite of the best intentions of the family and the agency some placements fail. According to the findings of a survey conducted by the University of Maine less than ten (10) percent of adoptions disrupt within the first three (3) years of the placement. There are a number of factors which may contribute to a disruption. These factors include: Mismatch – Adoptive family is unable to tolerate child’s characteristics, behavior or personality due to incompatibility with parental values and/or lifestyles. Also, the child’s characteristics, behavior or personality, are in conflict with adoptive parents’ stated preferences. Inadequate preparation – Child has not adequately resolved past losses or future expectations. Also, the adoptive family has accepted a child for placement without the knowledge/skills necessary to cope with the child’s special needs. Lack of support services – Either the agency has failed to provide or the family has not made use of services needed to support and sustain the placement. Also, the family may not have or is unable to seek out support from friends and relatives or kin. Failure to form emotional attachments – Parents personalize and misunderstand the child’s behavior. Child’s past experiences, relationships and/or emotional problems impede his ability to bond with a new family. Marital/family relationship problems – Children with special needs may place heavy demands on the time and energy of the parents which affects the relationship of family members. Developmental stage of child – Parents may be quite competent in caring for a child until he reaches a certain developmental stage, i.e., adolescence. Many adoption disruptions can be avoided through adequate preparation, support services and through open communication between the Children’s Service Worker and the family. However, on occasion the first indication of difficulties in the placement occurs during a crisis, i.e., the family requests that the child be removed or a child abuse/neglect report is made. When such a crisis occurs, the worker should respond immediately and take the following steps: Assess safety of the child Assess family’s interest and/or ability to preserve the child’s placement.  Assessment should include individual interviews with the parent and child Ask the family and the child to identify what they want/need to keep family intact. Some services which are available to the family include: Individual/family therapy Support group Mentor Respite Care Family Preservation Parent education including youth with elevated needs Level A and B resource provider training Assistance in obtaining additional information regarding child’s needs/condition Out-of-home placement, i.e., foster care, residential care, etc. If all efforts to preserve the family unit fail and the placement disrupts, the Children’s Service Worker should do the following: Involve family in plan for child’s removal from the home including explaining to the child why the placement did not succeed. The plan should include: Placement options including another adoptive placement Plan for continued contact between child and family. Closure with the family, if appropriate Maintain close contact with child following disruption. At least, weekly if geographically feasible. Evaluate what you learned about the child, family and self and how this information can be applied in making future child/parent matches. Schedule a FST meeting to reassess the goal for the child. Placement disruption can be a very stressful situation for the Children’s Service Worker as well as the child and family. The worker may assume blame and responsibility for the disruption. Supervisors should acknowledge these feelings and provide supports necessary to cope with/resolve these feelings.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/mo-section-4-chapter-9-adoption-and-guardianship-process-subsection-4-adoptive-placement-and
"MO :: Section 4, Chapter 9 (Adoption And Guardianship Process), Subsection 3 – Selecting Adoptive Families",Missouri,Rules,"2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019","Administrative process, Adoption, Court system, Definitions",,,"The process of selecting a family creates an opportunity to choose the ideal home and family for the child. By following the follow steps, you will gain a better understanding of what kind of home and family might be best for the child. One of the most important factors to consider when choosing a family is every child is unique and you will need to consider what each of the families can offer the child as they grow up.  Do they need two parent household or is single parent household fine?  Do they need a strong male influence?  Does the child need to be an only child? Do they need to be placed with siblings? What about pets?  The answers to some of these questions may lead you to the adoptive family for the child. Preliminary Screening Process The Children’s Service Worker, adoption specialist, supervisor and/or Circuit Manager will screen the Adoptive Family Assessments according to staffing criteria and select at least three (3) and no more than five (5) for consideration by the staffing committee. Those involved in the screening include: Direct Children’s Service Worker, if applicable Adoption specialist Children’s Service Supervisor I or Circuit Manager Case manager Criteria to consider during preliminary screening, but not limited to, is as follows: Ability to meet the needs of the child Ability to accept the physical, emotional, and mental conditions of child Acceptance of legal risk, if applicable Acceptance of continued contact with siblings, and significant others when beneficial to the child Acceptance of the background of the birth parents Commitment to encourage and preserve the child’s cultural identity Availability of and acceptance of use of community resources required by the child Acceptance of supervision during adoption process In certain instances, it may be appropriate and necessary to hold an adoption staffing for a child when only one family becomes available as an adoptive placement resource for the child or sibling group at the request of the FST or Regional Director. Adoption Staffing Team The purpose of this team is to apply a Consensus Building approach to the practice of selecting a permanent family for a child in Children’s Division (CD) custody who is in need of an adoptive placement. Additionally, CD recognizes the child’s placement provider and other foster/adoptive families along with professional staff are essential, vital members of this selection process. Team Membership – The following persons are mandatory members and shall be invited to participate in the Adoption Staffing: Child’s Children’s Service Worker and his/her supervisor Case manager and his/her supervisor Adoption specialist and his/her supervisor, if applicable Child’s placement provider (if placement provider is not an adoptive applicant for the child) Other foster or adoptive parents of special needs children CASA/GAL Juvenile officer Child’s counselor, therapist, psychologist, etc. Community representative Any other person who has vital significance in the child’s life Prospective adoptive family’s Resource Development Worker, if geographically feasible Other members – While the membership is mandatory as is notification of each member of the formal staffing meeting, it is not mandatory that all be in attendance. There shall be at minimum 80% of invited members present for the Adoption Staffing to be considered an official Adoption Staffing. Opinions, in writing, must be sought from any members unable to attend the Adoption Staffing and utilized in the staffing discussion. Member participation may be obtained via conference call during the meeting or by asking them to submit their preferences in writing prior to the meeting. To achieve consistency for all prospective family interviews, the same members must be present for each interview. If that is not possible the team member may submit their preference in writing for all prospective families. The basic intent is to obtain as much participation as possible from those who have significance in the child’s life while recognizing practical issues of busy schedules and geographic constraints. Conflict of interest: If a relationship between a member of the team and the person being staffed exists, that precludes them from being objective, that member of the team shall be excused from the discussion and selection process. The child’s placement provider must be invited to the staffing and every possible effort should be made to include them in the staffing decision. When geographic constraints exist, conference calls are an option. If the placement provider cannot participate in the staffing, staff should request the placement provider review the prospective families’ information and provide recommendations as to the family they selected as well as their first alternative and second alternative in writing. Staff should work hand-in-hand with placement providers to obtain their feedback and participation.  However, If the placement providers have indicated an interest in adopting the child, they are not members of the decision making process but provide information of the child to the team before being excused. The foster or adoptive family appointed to serve as standing members of the team should be well versed in the philosophy of permanence and achieving the best interests of the child. Additionally, they shall not be Children’s Division staff members. They should be chosen on the basis of: Their skill/knowledge about out-of-home/permanency planning for children Demonstrated ability to successfully foster/adopt special needs children Availability to participate on a regular basis Ability to effectively participate as a team member The representative of the child placing agency should be the staff member who has the greatest rapport with the child. The community representative should be one who is interested and knowledgeable about public child welfare services. All members of the Adoption Staffing Team shall sign the Statement of Confidentiality for Adoption Staffing Team Members, (CD-135). Preparing for the Adoption Staffing Prior to an Adoption Staffing being scheduled the Child’s Summary for Adoption should be provided (with identifying information- if any, blacked out) to the pre-adoptive families selected through the preliminary screening process. The families should then be given ten (10) business days to review the Child’s Summary and provide their written responses on the Family Response Form (CD-192). Once the Children’s Service Worker has received the Family Response Forms back from the prospective adoptive families, the Children’s Service Worker shall mail Child Information Packets to the team members participating in the Adoption Staffing. The Child Information Packet should contain the following information: A Cover Letter with the following information: The Adoption Staffing Meeting Time and Location (should be scheduled a minimum of two (2) to four (4) weeks in advance to allow for maximum participation) A reminder to the team members about confidentiality of the information contained in the Child Information Packet A request that if they are unable to attend that their recommendations in writing be provided five (5) business days before the scheduled meeting so that copies can be made for all staffing team members in attendance A request they return any copied material to the CD office at the time of the meeting or when they mail in their written recommendation, if they are unable to attend the Adoption Staffing. All written material copied and shared with non-CD members must be returned to the Adoption Specialist for destruction. The Child’s Summary The Statement of Confidentiality for Adoption Staffing Team Members (CD-135) The Family Response Form (CD-192) The Adoptive Family Home Assessment A blank copy of the Adoption Staffing Prospective Adoptive Family Interview Questionnaire (CD-134) should also be included in the packet so that the team members can review and come prepared to offer suggestions as to which questions on the Questionnaire they would like to ask of the potential adoptive families during the Adoption Staffing interview. Explain to the Team that they are not required to ask the prospective adoptive families every question on the tool; however they shall use the same set of questions for every family being interviewed for the same child or sibling group. If the Adoption Staffing Team has additional questions specific to an identified family, they can include questions that are not posed in the questionnaire in order to make an informed decision regarding the family that is selected to adopt the child or sibling group. Appropriate notice shall be given to the prospective adoptive families to allow them to make arrangements to participate in an interview either in person or by phone. Families are not required to participate in the interview process, however if they elect not to participate they should be informed of the possibility of an interviewed family being selected. Workers shall also explain to prospective adoptive families as well as to all members of the Adoption Staffing Team, how they may request a review of the decision made by the Adoption Staffing Team, given there was a perceived error during the process or the requestor provides specific examples of perceived bias which precluded consensus from being reached. The request must be submitted within three (3) working days of the Adoption Staffing Team decision. Requests received after the prescribed time frame will not be considered. The request is submitted on the Request for Review of Family Support Team or Adoption Staffing Team Decision, CD-190. It must be recognized that most families will be ill at ease and sensitive to the competition with other families. Every effort must be taken to make them comfortable upon their arrival at the office and during the interview. Plans should be made to conduct the interviews on the same day if possible; all the same members of the staffing team must be present for each interview in order to achieve consistency in the interview process.  Families should be prepared to bring their own children if this is important to the decision to place a child with a particular family. Have the following documents available at the Adoption Staffing: The Statement of Confidentiality for Adoption Staffing Team Members (CD-135) The Child’s Summary for Adoption Placement The Adoptive Family Assessments The Family Response Forms (CD-192) The Adoptive Staffing Prospective Adoptive Family Interview Questionnaires (CD-134) The Adoption Staffing Decision Worksheet (CD-189) Statement of Legal Risk (CD-191; optional at time of staffing) Conducting the Staffing and Utilization of the Consensus Building Approach Although operating as a team, at least one (1) person must be designated to facilitate the meeting. This should be the adoption specialist, but in the event there is no adoption specialist involved, the child’s A/C worker, CD Supervisor or Children’s Service Specialist may facilitate the meeting. Conducting the Adoption Staffing: State the purpose of the meeting, and review and remind the membership of the importance of maintaining confidentiality of the information shared. The facilitator will need to have all team members sign the Statement of Confidentiality for Adoption Staffing Team Members form (CD-135). Introductions should be made of all Adoption Staffing Team Members. The facilitator, child(ren)’s A/C worker, and child’s current placement provider, present information about the child(ren), using the Child Summary for Adoption as a guide, including a recommendation regarding characteristics of the type of family who can best meet the needs of the child. This information should be concise and provide adequate information about the child’s needs, behaviors, background, etc. Answer any questions about the information provided. Share information about each prospective family. The Family Response form (CD-192) should be discussed along with information contained in the Adoptive Family Assessment. Explain to the Team the purpose of the interview and the use of the Adoption Staffing Prospective Adoptive Family Interview Questionnaire (CD-134). Team members should be made aware each questionnaire will be collected at the end of the staffing and retained in the child’s file. The Adoption Staffing Team should utilize the same set of questions for each family interested in and being considered for the same child or sibling group. The prospective adoptive families shall be given the opportunity to ask questions about the child and if selected what the transition plan may look like. Prospective families should also be given the opportunity to speak with their Adoptive Worker privately (away from the staffing) to ask any further questions related to the staffing process or the child and their background. Interview the family either in person or by phone utilizing the Adoption      Staffing Prospective Adoptive Family Interview Questionnaire (CD-134). Use the following guidelines for adoption staffing where prospective adoptive families are to be interviewed before making a final recommendation regarding the placement choice for a child. This interview should serve to enhance the information included in the adoptive family assessment and the Family Response Form (CD-192). The purpose of the interview is to enhance the staffing team’s ability to make an informed decision about which family can best meet the needs of the child. The Adoption Staffing Interview: Confidentiality expectations will be discussed. The Statement of Confidentiality for Adoption Staffing Team Members, CD-135, must be signed by all participants. A Brief overview of the child will be provided, utilizing the Child’s Summary for Adoption Placement, as a guide. At a minimum, the presentation must include the child’s legal status and a clear, but concise description of the child’s condition, including any changes or updates since the Child’s Summary for Adoption Placement was completed. The child’s desires in an adoptive family and any special requirements established for the child by the child’s jurisdictional court must be discussed. Examples of requirements of the jurisdictional court include the right to make the final selection of the adoptive family or a review of the CD recommendations before allowing the family to know of the final decision. At the end of the staffing meeting, the prospective adoptive family should be asked directly whether they continue to be interested in the specific child. Explain that there are no negative consequences to their status if they elect not to accept the child. Information should be given to families of when they will be notified of the selection decision. Consideration should be given to what is involved in making the final decision and approximately how long it will be before the decision is made. After the interviews are complete, the Adoption Staffing Team should discuss each prospective family, discussing their strengths and identify skills needed to be successful with the child to determine if they will be able to meet the needs of the child. Discuss questions and comments to achieve consensus on the family selected, first alternative family and, second alternative family with the skills to meet the needs of the child(ren) being placed using the following criteria: Ability to meet the needs of the child Ability to accept the physical, emotional, and mental conditions of the child Acceptance of the background of the birth parents Acceptance of continued contact with siblings, and significant others when beneficial to the child Acceptance of legal risk, if applicable Commitment to encourage and preserve the child’s cultural identity and religious beliefs Availability of and acceptance of use of community resources required by the child Acceptance of supervision during the adoption process Ability to rear the child to adulthood or make an alternative plan Consideration of what may happen to the child in the event of the prospective adoptive resource provider’s death or incapacitation Consensus is a decision-making process that fully utilizes the resources of a group. It is more difficult and time consuming to reach consensus than a democratic vote or autocratic decision. There may be trade-offs and the various decision alternatives will not satisfy everyone. Complete unanimity is not the goal and this is rarely possible. However, it is possible for each individual to have had the opportunity to express their opinion, be listened to, and accept a group decision based on its logic and feasibility considering all relevant factors. This requires mutual trust and respect of each team member. A consensus decision represents a reasonable decision that all members of the group can accept. It is not necessarily the optimal decision for each member, however it represents a decision that is in the best interest of the child(ren) being staffed. Guidelines for reaching Consensus: Make sure everyone is heard from and feels listened to. Avoid arguing for your own position. Present information as clearly as possible. Listen to each other’s reactions and comments to assess understanding of the position being presented. Do not assume that someone must win and someone must lose when a discussion reaches a stalemate. Instead, look for the most acceptable decision to meet the child’s needs. Try to think creatively. Team members should not change their mind simply to avoid confrontation, conflict, or to reach an agreement or maintain harmony. Explore the reasons and be sure that everyone accepts the solution for similar or complementary reasons. In this environment, the best interest of the child should be the primary focus. Avoid conflict reducing techniques such as a majority vote, averaging, coin tosses or bargaining. Differences of opinion are natural and expected. Seek them out; value them, and try to involve everyone in the decision process. Disagreements can improve the group’s decision. The facilitator shall obtain the consensus of the team with the recommendations as to why they have selected a specific family as well as the team’s recommendation on a first alternative family and second alternative family. This information shall be recorded on the Adoption Staffing Decision Worksheet (CD-189) and maintained in the child’s record. Before adjourning the meeting, obtain all the copies of the adoptive family assessments shared with the membership. Destroy all copies except one set of those considered and retain this set in the child’s file. The leader shall notify all prospective adoptive families Resource Development Workers of the decision, if not already present at the staffing.12. The family’s Resource Development Worker should notify the family of the decision reached by the Staffing Team. Notify the families not selected by the Adoption Staffing Team of their ability to request an Adoption Staffing Decision Review. Although, the committee should reach a decision within one (1) meeting, in unusual circumstances it may be necessary to reconvene another staffing for a specific child to arrive at a final recommendation of the families considered. This process should be repeated as often as necessary until the child is placed for adoption. The Leader should seek supervisory consultation and review if consensus is not met. Activities Following Selection Once an adoptive family has been selected the case manager/direct Children’s Service Worker will: Present complete information about the child to the pre-adoptive family using an updated child’s summary within seven (7) days of selecting the family. Have the family sign off on the child’s summary in acknowledgment that they have received the information. Obtain commitment from family within seven (7) days of presentation, if they wish to pursue adoption of the child: Explain importance of filing adoption petition within 90 days of approval for adoption. If the family does not want to pursue adoption, present the information about the child to the first alternative and second alternative families. Continue search for new family if none of the alternative families accept the child. Obtain the adoptive family’s signature with date on the child’s summary, give the original to the family and retain a copy for the adoptive family’s case record. Within five (5) days of obtaining commitment from the family, with the support of the Family Support Team, develop specifics of pre-placement plan which accommodates the wishes of the child, current foster family and pre-adoptive family, including the following: First meeting Additional visits Other relationship building activities Filing of adoption petition if licensed as a foster/adoptive family Place child with the family after obtaining any required authorization from court. Comply with ICPC and/or ICAMA requirements if applicable Update the Placement Screen in FACES to reflect the correct type of adoptive placement and financial assistance (if the family is the current resource provider, DO NOT change the placement type) Review with the family and child, if age appropriate, any concerns and issues that have evolved during pre-placement activities. Inform pre-adoptive family of the availability of adoption subsidy, if needed, for the child’s care. Decide on the appropriate financial assistance plan using out-of-home care funding sources or adoption subsidy according to procedures related to each of these funding sources. If there are no other competing petitions anticipated or filed, and the juvenile office and legal services have declined to file the TPR, consult with the family regarding their willingness to proceed with a petition for adoption and termination of parental rights. Explain child’s right to make a written request to the court that finalized the adoption to obtain identifying information about the biological parents or adult siblings at the time the child reaches age 18 as well as the right to register with the Missouri Adoption Information Registry to permit contact with biological parents or adult siblings.  Contact will be made by the registry if a match is made. Explain adoptive family rights to obtain non-identifying information about the biological parent or child after adoption. Explain child’s right to obtain non-identifying information regarding the biological Prepare child and family for adoption, including discussion of the following issues: Understanding and acceptance of the past Separation from birth family Meaning of and desire for adoption Placement with siblings, if planned Plans to continue to encourage and preserve the child’s cultural identity Assess and process child and family’s readiness to complete the adoption through scheduled visitation in pre-adoptive home.Once the Division has committed to adoption by the family, removal of the child can occur only at the family’s decision that they do not wish to adopt the child, or the child’s emotional and/or physical safety is at risk (i.e., a child abuse and neglect investigation has found “preponderance of evidence” and the child is not safe in the home). Prepare child and family for court hearings. Prepare and submit necessary reports to the court for transfer of custody and/or final decree hearings. Interpret confidential nature of adoption to child and family: Develop plan for visits with siblings after adoption, if it is part of the adoption plan for the child. Develop plan for continued parental or relative contact if the plan is in the best interest of the child. Attend court hearings, being prepared to testify if so ordered. Make one visit with family and child after final decree hearing to: Make a referral to community support groups, if needed Reinforce the lifetime commitment of adoption Maintain links to any needed rehabilitation services Remind family of yearly review of subsidy and necessary maintenance activities Plan for continued counseling, if needed Assure that services will be extended if at any time in the future the family or child determines they are in need of services related to the adoption Record all activities every 30 days. Once the adoption is finalized, change the legal status of the child to LS-5. Prior to the LS-5 being added on the AC function the following must be in place: Child’s DCN on adoption subsidy contract TPR/Death entered on biological parents Adoption Petition(Adoption Hearing) entered Adoptive Placement (same DVN as on the adoption contract) The alternative care case will close once an LS-5 Adoption Assistance is open in FACES.  For cases without adoption subsidy, manually close the case with the change of legal status.  Close the alternative care case record with a termination summary and copy of final decree: Keep case open if continued services are required, closing case at mutually agreed upon point (if subsidy is not active) Copy information needed for the Adoption Subsidy case file, either adding it to the family’s existing subsidy file or begin a subsidy case file for the family Assure case has been transferred to subsidy worker. Case should be transferred from A/C to subsidy within thirty (30) working days after receiving the adoption decree and/or release or award of legal guardianship. Adoption Staffing Team Decision Review for Family Not Selected Request for Review A family not selected as the adoptive resource or a team member may request a review of the decision made by the Adoption Staffing Team, if the family believes the following regarding the staffing: There was a procedure error per Adoption Staffing Team process The requestor provides specific examples of perceived bias which precluded consensus from being reached. The family must submit the request for review: Within three (3) business days of the Adoption Staffing Team Meeting Decision In writing using the CD-190d, submitted to the Circuit Manger of the Case Manager of the child If the case is managed by a Foster Care Case Management, (FCCM), contractor, submitted to the FCCM Director. If there are no safety concerns regarding the foster youth(s) remaining in the home, they should not be moved from the home until the decision is finalized. Independent Reviewer Qualifications The Independent reviewer is appointed by the Regional Director.  The reviewer must meeting the following qualifications: Current Children’s Division Staff No connection to the case No personal or perceived interest in the outcome of the case Successful completed of Mediation Training Demonstrates skills with handling emotionally charged situations Demonstrates skills in problem solving Demonstrates skills in effective questioning Demonstrates skills in active listening Demonstrates an excellent understanding and practice of the best interest of the child per Missouri Revised Statutes Chapter 210, 210.001, 210.112 4(3), 210.565, 210.720, 210.762 All families reviewed will be notified of the decision within one business day of the decision.

The Waiting Child Registration will serve as the referral for the Heart Gallery, Raise The Future and the AdoptUSKids website.  For the child to be placed on the Heart Gallery website, an electronic copy of the registration and the court order or CD-AE-1b should be sent via email to Vickie.Stoneberger@dss.mo.gov with Heart Gallery typed in the subject line. Raise The Future has the responsibility of adding children to the AdoptUSKids.org website; however, each Adoption Specialist must have access to this site assigned by a designee from Central Office. If you need access, contact Central Office Adoption Unit and access information will be assigned. The worker is responsible for making changes to the child’s profile, updating the child’s picture as needed or making changes to the profile as needed.  If assistance is needed, Central Office Adoption Unit staff are available to provide technical assistance.  Training is also available through AdoptUSKids tutorials accessible after login or by signing up for free web training at Web-Training@adoptuskids.org . Creating AdoptUSKids Case Identification Numbers: Children entered on the AdoptUSKids web site must have an identification number. By registering the child(ren) with Raise The Future, the child, will automatically be added to the AdoptUSKids website and they will assign a number for the child.  No agency should use any part of the child’s DCN, SSN, Call Case Number or JO number as the child’s AdoptUSKids case number, as this identification number is viewable to the public. The child’s DCN should be used in the last name field with the child’s last name so that the child can easily be located.  If the child is not registered through Raise The Future website, Foster Care Case Management and Specialized Care cases should create their own system to determine AdoptUSKids case identification numbers. The Children’s Division staff should use the following as a breakdown of how the case identification number should be created: The child’s case number will ALWAYS begin with “MO”, which stands for Missouri. The next two numbers are to represent the area which has jurisdiction of the child (see area assignment codes below). The next three numbers are to represent the FIPS County code for the county that case manages the child. The next five numbers are to represent the employee’s worker number. The last two numbers are to represent the chronological order in which the child was entered onto the web site. NOTE: The following are the Area Assignment Codes as listed on AdoptUSKids.org: 01 = Central Office                                         05 = Area 1/Northwest Region 02 = Area 5/Jackson County                         06 = Area 6/St. Louis City 03 = Area 3/Southeast Region                       07 = Area 7/St. Louis County 04 = Area 4/Southwest Region                     08 = Area 2/Northeast Region Example Case Identification Number for Lisa: MO080071234501 Lisa is from Northeast Region, Audrain County, her worker’s # is 12345 and she is the first child to be listed on the worker’s log. Case Identification Assignment Log: Workers are to maintain a log of children who appear on AdoptUSKids, Raise The Future and the Heart gallery that contains the date registered and the child information.  This will allow the worker to keep track of children entered on the web sites, as well as provide a listing of children that workers can staff with their supervisors in regard to recruitment for permanency. Photographs: A clear, attractive picture of the child(ren) should be used to recruit for the child.  A school or professional picture is best; however a clear snapshot will work.  Photos for AdoptUSKids, Missouri Heart Gallery and Raise The Future should be formatted in jpeg or jpg image files. Photographs should be: Current, within six (6) months Good, realistic, age appropriate representations of the child Smiling, positive photo Clear color pictures Face/head shots will provide the clearest view of the child Professional photographs when possible Pictures of siblings as groups if possible Modest clothing Photos should reflect the professionalism of the agency Photographs should NOT include: Identifying clothes/information in background Polaroids Questionable attire “Glamour” shots type of pictures Shadows or bright shots Special effects High gloss professional shots which present difficulty in scanning Paper print outs from digital cameras or Xeroxed reproductionsA photo is required before the child’s profile can be viewed by families and public users. One photo can be added to each child profile. For workers who are adding the child only to the AdoptUSKids website, a digital photo may be sent to photos@AdoptUSKids.org , or mail a hard copy to: AdoptUSKids Photos 520 Pike Street, Suite 1350 Seattle, WA 98101 You may also add a video or audio clip to a child profile on the AdoptUSKids website. The video or audio clip is viewable by all website visitors. Media Profile Outline: Please follow the Media Profile Outline provided below.  This profile may be used when providing brief profiles for recruitment purposes: Purpose Statement (to be used at the beginning): “The purpose of the information provided below is to briefly introduce you to the child(ren) for whom our agency is recruiting an adoptive placement.” INCLUDE: At the top of the profile, list separately the child’s first name, date of birth (mo/yr), race and gender. School grade information can be added if necessary. Within the narrative, be creative, energetic, use descriptive words Use an attention-getting phrase to begin the narrative and draw readers in. Include likes, hobbies, interests, what they want (family, life, goals, pets, church) Describe the child’s personality. Provide information about the child’s educational accomplishments. Positive quotes from the child caregiver (don’t refer to the “residential” caregiver) Quotes from the child describing themselves (i.e. favorite things about themselves, etc.) A description of the child’s need for a family with particular skills or family configuration (don’t limit to a two-parent family if that is not necessary). Legal Status Add the date updated/completed at the bottom of profile. The profile needs to be at least three paragraphs, and 120-150 words. NO more than 1 – 1 ½ pages in length. If you have a photo, state it is available upon request. Special concerns– contact with siblings, family or past placement providers. DO NOT INCLUDE: Identifying information within the narrative(i.e., child’s last name, school’s name, city where child resides, parent’s names, date and reason the child is in care, and history of abuse/neglect (any significant information may be included in the confidential narrative section). Serious medical diagnosis and treatment involved. Information about the child’s educational needs. Details about failed past placements (any significant information may be included in the confidential narrative section). Anything that might be embarrassing to the child. Ask yourself, “Would I feel comfortable showing this to the child and would it make them uncomfortable?” Full date of birth s , age or grades in school as a part of the narrative. Serious medical diagnosis and treatment involved. Information about the child’s educational needs. Worker Responsibilities for the Recruitment of Children on Raise The Future Website, Missouri Heart Gallery and AdoptUSKids: Gather and send information to Raise The Future so that they may create a child profile; Create a child profile to use on all three websites (if appropriate); Obtain photos of the child(ren); Workers are to answer all inquiries within 3 business days of receiving the inquiry; Make status changes, for example, FIP-Family In Progress, when necessary; and Update the profile information for children when needed. Managing Child Profiles on AdoptUSKids: AdoptUSKids provides the worker with a “My Home” page. This page is specific to the worker who signs in, and will provide the worker with information regarding the children they have entered onto the site. AdoptUSKids will provide reminders when a child is in need of a photograph, how many open inquires there are, and how many inactive cases the worker may have. It is recommended that workers check the AdoptUSKids site on a weekly basis, answering all inquiries within 3 business days of the inquiry so that prompt response can be provided to families who inquire about a specific child. If the child’s profile is not updated yearly, AdoptUSKids will automatically take that child’s photo off the public site and place them in “inactive” status. This will cause the recruitment efforts for this child to be put on hold until an update can be entered. If a child’s case is re-assigned to a new worker (that already has access to AdoptUSKids) the current worker or Location Administrator will have the responsibility to reassign the child’s AdoptUSKids case. To obtain initial access to the AdoptUSKids website for new workers the supervisor will need to notify Central Office Adoption Unit, providing the worker’s name, correct e-mail address and contact information so that the worker can be added as a case manager with access to AdoptUSKids. In the event that the child’s case is transferred to a contracted or specialized case management agency, the new worker for the case will be responsible for contacting AdoptUSKids IT or Central Office Adoption Unit with the correct contact information for that child. Each agency is responsible for managing their own cases on the AdoptUSKids website.

It involves sequential activities designed to utilize all possible resources in Missouri, the region and the nation in finding a permanent family for a child. No later than the end of the first month following the decision that a child is available for adoption, the worker shall carry out the steps outlined below: Workers shall complete the Consent for Special Recruitment Efforts – CD-AE-1b and obtain a court order allowing special recruitment for the child. Workers shall write the Child’s Media Profile . Workers shall obtain a photograph of the child or sibling group available for adoption. Please attempt to utilize professional photographers for pictures of the children. You can utilize the photographers from the Heart Gallery or Raise the Future is able to assist in connecting workers with photographers in their geographical location. Supervisors shall review the adoption profile. Workers shall complete the Waiting Child Registration on-line via Raise the Future. The Waiting Child Registration will also serve as the referral for the Heart Gallery, Raise the Future and AdoptUSKids.  Once the registration has been filled out on Raise the Future website, an email should be sent to Vickie Stoneberger with Heart Gallery typed in the subject line and the court order or CD-AE-1b attached to signify that media recruitment by the court has been ordered. Workers are responsible for the referral of children with a goal of adoption that do not have an identified adoptive placement to Raise The Future.  Raise The Future has the responsibility of adding the children to the AdoptUSKids website and Raise The Future website. Send a statewide e-mail request for adoptive assessments of approved families including the following information: Name and county of sending worker or agency; First name only, gender, cultural identity, and age of child for whom you are seeking an adoptive family placement resource; Brief description of child’s legal status, appearance, health and handicap status, background and interests/hobbies; Preferred characteristics of family sought for child; Information about screening/formal staffing plan including date, time and place. Refer minority children to any Children’s Division (CD) special recruitment projects. Worker shall write Child’s Summary for Adoption Placement . A thorough and accurate pre-placement study of the child is a critical component of the adoption process. The information provided assists potential families and the Adoption Staffing team members in making an informed decision regarding the child. Prior to an Adoption Staffing being scheduled the Child’s Summary for Adoption should be provided to the pre-adoptive families selected through the preliminary screening process. The families should then be given ten (10) business days to review the Child’s Summary and provide their written responses on the Family Response Form (CD-192). Also, this information may be important to the child if/when he has questions regarding his heritage. The Children’s Service Worker may contact a number of resources to complete the pre-placement study including birth parents/relatives, physicians, placement provider, teacher and the child. The Children’s Service Worker completing the child’s summary is not to include identifying information of the birth parents. The outline that should be followed when preparing the child’s summary for adoption placement can be found in E-Forms under Child’s Summary for Adoption Placement. Within the first two months when needed; the worker shall initiate other child specific recruitment activities, i.e. Wednesday’s Child appearances, A Place to Call Home appearances or involvement in the Linking Hearts Adoption Event. Requests for assistance and additional information are to be made directly to the Adoption Unit in Central Office. Following the establishment of the goal of adoption, there will be regular supervisory reviews of each child for whom an appropriate resource cannot be located. The review will be conducted weekly for children 12-months and under, and monthly for children over 12-months. This procedure includes: Reviewing recruitment activities and responses to recruitment, Identifying barriers to placement, Reviewing the child’s narrative profile to ensure that the child’s strengths are presented in an appealing manner, Determine additional plans and activities for continuing to meet the child’s goal of permanency through adoption, such as: participation in various adoption fairs/carnivals around the state; and Record in the child’s narrative in FACES under supervisory consult that the supervisor has reviewed the recruitment efforts and documented any additional efforts that will be utilized. The supervisor should review and approve the narrative. When required procedures have not been implemented, the immediate supervisor must outline with the worker a process for recruiting families for any child waiting for adoptive placement. It is the Division’s preference that children obtain the permanency of adoption rather than permitting the child to remain indefinitely in out-of-home care. Therefore, the following activities should be carried out on a regular basis for any “waiting” child: Follow-up immediately on any subsequent referrals from exchanges, recruitment activity, etc. Initiate additional e-mail requests at reasonable intervals; i.e., every three months.

In making the selection of an adoptive family, consideration must be given to all the child’s current and future needs. Since adoption is a lifetime commitment for both the family and the child, attention must be given to assessing the many issues involved in meeting the child’s needs and the ability of a prospective family to meet those needs. Once this match has occurred, the placement, if not with the present foster family, should be made as soon as possible.

This process is mandatory for a child being placed with a new family; however it is an optional process for the selection of the current resource provider family as the adoptive parent, unless required by the Family Support Team or recommended by the Regional Director or designee, and then must be completed.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/mo-section-4-chapter-9-adoption-and-guardianship-process-subsection-1-adoption-planning-6

It is imperative that the Children’s Service Worker address these issues with the child and family to ensure a smooth transition from a temporary to a permanent relationship. The issues which must be discussed include the following: Adoption requires a permanent commitment by all parties and should be thoughtfully considered and agreed to by the child and family. The foster parent shall inform the caseworker within sixty days of the caseworker’s initial query if they desire to adopt the child per RSMo 210.566. The family/child might need a third-party intermediary or therapist to assist them in making the decision. The role of Children’s Division will change from case management to placement support.

The agency and court shall give preference and first consideration for adoptive placements to foster parents. However, the final determination of the propriety of the adoption of such foster child shall be within the sole discretion of the court.” In addition, RSMo 210.566 states:  “If a foster child becomes free for adoption and the foster parents desire to adopt the child, they shall inform the caseworker within sixty (60) days of the caseworker’s initial query. If the foster parents choose not to pursue adoption, they shall make every effort to support and encourage the child’s placement in a permanent home, including but not limited to providing information on the history and care needs of the child and accommodating transitional visitation, per RSMo 210.566. The Division implements this requirement when the child is legally available for adoption or when it appears very likely the child will be legally available for adoption by assessing the interest and capacity of the present family to adopt the child. Additionally, it is important to note that neither the Division nor the statute provides a guarantee that the present resource provider family will be approved or granted the right to adopt the child in their care. As in any adoption, only the juvenile court has the final authority to approve the adoption of a specific child by a specific family. During the staffing process the worker/team making adoption plans for a child should consider the foster parents’ capacity to meet the child’s long-term needs through adoption prior to considering other adoptive families. In making the selection of an adoptive family, consideration must be given to all of the child’s current and future needs.  Since adoption is a lifetime commitment for both the family and the child, attention must be given to assessing the many issues involved in meeting the child’s needs and the ability of a prospective adoptive family to meet those needs. In assessing resource provider families who currently have the child in care, the Division will assess the following factors: The length of time the child has been in the family’s care The attachment of the child to the family and the ability of the child to make new attachments The age of the child at placement with the specific family The child’s medical, educational, emotional, social, cultural identity and the family’s demonstration of meeting these needs as a predictor for successful parenting throughout the child’s growth to adulthood The family’s understanding of the purpose and meaning of the adoptive relationship The child’s desire to be adopted by the specific family The child’s acceptance as a member of the immediate family and understanding of the child’s role in the extended family The child’s assimilation into the family, including the family’s ability to encourage and preserve the child’s cultural identity and religious background Whether the child has siblings that will need placement with the child The need for continued contact (after adoption) with siblings, other relatives/kin and significant others The family’s acceptance of legal risk The child’s unique parenting needs When adoption becomes the permanency goal, the worker shall inform the current resource family of: The nine month preference statute and placement selection policies. This can be waived for supervision or desertion of the judge The required completion of an adoptive family assessment The required filing of the adoption petition within 90 days of the Division’s recommendation/approval for the family to adopt the child The Division’s willingness and desire that they have full opportunity to express their interest in adoption and to provide assistance in reaching this decision The range of factors that are assessed in determining their capacity to parent the child The availability of an adoption subsidy to assist in meeting the immediate and long-term costs of the child’s needs The child’s right, after age 18 to file a request with the court granting the adoptee to obtain identifying information about the biological parents or adult biological siblings Their right, legal guardian’s, and the child’s right, at age 18, to secure non-identifying information regarding the biological parents and siblings via completion of CS-50 The child’s right to register with the Adoption Information Registry via CD-51a at age 18 if he/she wishes to indicate a desire to be contacted by the biological parents or adult biological siblings The Family Support Team may serve as an Adoption Staffing if the only family being considered is the current placement providers. Use of a formal staffing team is still required if recommended by the Family Support Team or Regional Director. If the resource provider elects to adopt the child, they will not be a member of the staffing team.  When the resource parent chooses not to pursue adoption, they shall make every effort to support and encourage the child’s placement in a permanent home, including but not limited to providing information on the history and care needs of the child, accommodating transitional visitation and participating in the Adoption Staffing as a mandatory team member. Confirm the family’s interest in adoption within seven (7) days of explaining the permanent plan.  If the family is not interested or appropriate, seek another adoptive family to achieve permanency.  If interested, refer the family for adoptive application and family assessment to adoption specialist. Record any factors that resulted in the decision that the current resource family is appropriate as an adoptive parent within five (5) working days of decision.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/mo-section-4-chapter-9-adoption-and-guardianship-process-subsection-1-adoption-planning-process-912
"MO :: Section 4, Chapter 8 (Permanent Outcomes), Subsection 5 – Another Planned Permanent Living Arrangement",Missouri,Rules,"2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019","Permanency, Placement",,,"Another Planned Permanent Living Arrangement (APPLA) is meant to be a planned permanent placement with a person that has a strong connection and bond with the child. The child must be 16 years of age or older to choose this permanency option. Choosing this option is appropriate when there is a specific, long-term placement for the child and when it has been documented to the court that compelling reasons exist which make the other permanency options unacceptable. The compelling reasons must be clearly identified and documented in FACES. As with Placement with a Fit and Willing Relative, APPLA is not a legal final permanency option. Therefore, the court must continue to hold annual permanency hearings until such time that the court enters a legal final permanency order reunification, adoption, or guardianship) or the child reaches age 21. The case manager shall continue to schedule regular FST meetings and provide support services as identified by the FST. A goal APPLA should be selected as the most appropriate permanency option under these circumstances: The child objects to TPR, and the juvenile court and/or Division believes it is in the best interest of the child not to pursue termination Adoption has been ruled out Guardianship or transfer of custody has been ruled out Placement with a Fit and Willing Relative has been ruled out There is an identified appropriate planned permanent living arrangement in which the child wishes to continue living All possible additional services are explored with the child and/or the placement provider to provide permanency The child is age 16 or older The out-of-home care provider will make a formal Planned Permanency Agreement with the Division for this purpose. NOTE: Ruling out more permanent options based only on a child’s age is contrary to the goals of ASFA. Individual determinations about each child’s needs and circumstances are necessary. Criteria for Continuation of APPLA as a Permanency Option For youth with a goal of APPLA, for the case review and the continued approval of the case plan for the youth, the Children’s Service Worker must do the following: Document steps taken to ensure the youth’s out-of-home care provider is following the reasonable and prudent parenting standard Consult with the youth, in an age appropriate manner, about the opportunities and activities he/she could participate in regards to extracurricular, enrichment, cultural, and social activities; Document at each permanency hearing for the youth per PL113-103, the intensive, ongoing, unsuccessful efforts made for family placement including returning home, securing a placement for the youth with a fit and willing relative (including adult siblings), a legal guardian, or an adoptive parent. Efforts should include search technology (including social media) to find biological family members for the youth and should be as of the date of the hearing At each permanency hearing, the appropriateness of the placement will be re-determined by the court by ascertaining the permanency plan for the youth through the following: Youth is asked about the desired permanency outcome for him/her; The judicial determination explains why as of the date of the hearing, another planned permanent living arrangement is the best permanency plan for the youth; Compelling reasons are provided why it continues to not be in the best interests of the youth to: return home be placed for adoption; be placed with a legal guardian; or be placed with a fit and willing relative. There is evidence of support for engaging the youth in age or developmentally appropriate activities and social events: The youth’s out-of-home care provider is following the reasonable and prudent parenting standard and The youth has regular, ongoing opportunities to engage in age or developmentally appropriate activities (including consultation with the youth in an age appropriate manner). Permanency Pact A Permanency Pact should be completed whenever either of the two permanency options, Placement with a Fit and Willing Relative or Another Planned Permanent Living Arrangement (APPLA), is selected for a youth. The purpose of the Permanency Pact is to identify permanent supports for the youth who will continue to play a permanent role in the youth’s life. Establishing permanency is a federal requirement and a guiding principle of the Children’s Division. It is critical to the youth’s success to identify those adults who will continue to provide various supports through and beyond the transition from care. Clarifying exactly what the various supports will include can help to avoid gaps in the youth’s safety net and misunderstandings between the youth and the supportive adult. The Permanency Pact is a tool to be used for the ongoing conversation regarding permanency planning. It is a pledge by a supportive adult to provide specific supports to a young person in foster care. Developed by FosterClub, the Pact provides the structure that is needed to help both youth and adults establish a positive, kin-like relationship. It is important that both the youth and the permanent connection identified understands their involvement with the youth. Youth transitioning from foster care are often unsure about who they can count on for ongoing support. Many of their significant relationships with adults have been based on professional connections which will terminate once the transition from care is completed. A Permanency Pact provides: structure and a safety net for the youth a defined and verbalized commitment by both parties to a long term supportive relationship clarity regarding the expectations of the relationship A Permanency Pact creates a formalized, facilitated process to connect youth in foster care with a supportive adult. The process of bringing the supportive adult together with youth and developing a pledge or “Permanency Pact” has proven successful in clarifying the relationship and identifying mutual expectations. A committed, caring adult may provide a lifeline for a youth, particularly those who are preparing to transition out of foster care to life on their own. Participants in a Permanency Pact In addition to the two primary parties in a Permanency Pact (the youth and the supportive adult), it is recommended that a Facilitator assist in developing the Pact. The Facilitator may be a Case Worker, Resource Provider or other adult who: is knowledgeable in facilitating Permanency Pacts is familiar with the youth, and can provide insight into the general needs of the youth transitioning from care The Supportive Adult is an adult who: has been identified by the youth has a relationship with the youth is willing to commit to a life-long relationship with the youth is a positive role-model, and is able to provide the youth with specific support on an on-going basis The Facilitator then: makes initial contact with the identified adult(s) updates them regarding the youths current situation gauges their level of interest assists the adult in identifying possible supports they will provide, and schedules and facilitates the Permanency Pact meeting Working with the Supportive Adult, the Facilitator can use the list of 45 Suggested Supports to draft a list of supports that the adult wishes to offer the youth. The list is then presented to the youth who will acknowledge the offer and accept those supports that they feel would be most beneficial. Additional supports may be suggested by either the youth or the supportive adult. The final list may then be hand written on the Permanency Pact available in e-forms. The youth and Supportive Adult sign the Pact and the Facilitator provides a witness signature. Copies of the Permanency Pact are provided to the youth, the Supportive Adult and maintained in the case record. All other members of the youth’s Permanency Planning/Family Support Team receive copies of the Permanency Pact. Taking a step toward trusting a relationship is often a very great accomplishment for a youth with a background where relationships are broken, promises are often not kept, and disappointment in caretakers prevails. The gift that a Supportive Adult contributes by way of a life-long commitment to the relationship is heroic. The impact of the forged relationship may be profound to all parties.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/mo-section-4-chapter-8-permanent-outcomes-subsection-5-another-planned-permanent-living

Placement with a Fit and Willing Relative, without adoption or guardianship, is not a legally secure permanency option. Therefore, the court must continue to hold annual permanency hearings until such time that the court enters a legally final permanency order (reunification, adoption, or guardianship) or the child reaches age 21.

"MO :: Section 4, Chapter 8 (Permanent Outcomes), Subsection 3 – Guardianship",Missouri,Rules,"2023, 2022, 2021","Guardianship, Permanency",,,"Guardianship is a permanency option for children for whom reunification or adoption is not feasible. In Missouri, orders of guardianship are entered by the Probate Court. Guardianship requires the caretaker to assume a high level of responsibility and authority over the child. Once guardianship is awarded by the probate court, the Division’s legal responsibility for case management services is terminated. However, with the passage of H.R. 6893: Fostering Connections and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008, youth who enter guardianship after the age of 16 are eligible for Chafee Foster Care Independence Program Services and these services must be monitored. This plan has limited application, and should be selected under the following circumstances: The Family Support Team has determined that family reunification is not likely in the foreseeable future and termination of parental rights is deemed inappropriate Adoption is not an option Current placement provider is able to meet the needs of the child including financial Current placement is stable The child’s caretaker family is willing to pursue guardianship The child, if over 14 years of age, consents The juvenile court having jurisdiction supports guardianship as an option and is willing to terminate its jurisdiction when such is granted The child’s Family Support Team is supportive of plan for guardianship. There are two forms of guardianship available to caretakers interested in this permanency option for children. The first is guardianship by a qualified relative or a qualified close nonrelated person in accordance with 453.072 RSMo. Qualified individuals achieving guardianship may be eligible for guardianship subsidy through the Children’s Division. The second form of guardianship is guardianship – no subsidy. Staff are encouraged to discuss these options with caretakers interested in legal guardianship and to explain the eligibility criteria for subsidy benefits. Staff will also have the responsibility for entering information into FACES appropriately as there will be two options available for guardianship in the placement section of FACES. These two options include guardianship-subsidy and guardianship-no subsidy. As used in this section and defined by 453.072 RSMo: Relative means any grandparent, aunt, uncle, adult sibling of the child or adult first cousin of the child, or any other person related to the child by blood or affinity; Close nonrelated person means any nonrelated person whose life is so intermingled with the child such that the relationship is similar to a family relationship. A priority should be made to place siblings together, whenever possible. CD must make reasonable efforts to place siblings in the same placement unless doing so would be contrary to the safety or well-being of any of the siblings. Children who are 16 years of age or older at the time of the guardianship are eligible for Chafee older youth services, even after the Guardianship is completed. These services shall be monitored by the family subsidy worker. The Division’s legal relationship, as well as services and foster care payments to the child/family, would terminate once guardianship is established. However, support services may continue as needed/desired and available, such as guardianship subsidy. Note: Adult Guardianships and Conservatorships are not the same as these types of guardianships and are considered for children between 18 and 21 who have a permanency goal of APPLA. Procedures for Pursuing Guardianship: Discuss prospects of guardianship with the Family Support Team including the child, if age appropriate, birth parent(s) and caretaker(s). If guardianship appears a viable option, the caretaker family should be directed to consult with legal counsel. Once the case plan has changed to guardianship, the Children’s Service Worker responsible for case management should notify the Children’s Service Worker responsible for the subsidy immediately to ensure that the subsidy worker has time to negotiate the Legal Guardianship subsidy agreement prior to the award of guardianship. The Children’s Service Worker responsible for the subsidy has the responsibility to meet with the prospective guardian to discuss services available through guardianship subsidy, including the option to name a successor guardian at the time of the initial subsidy agreement or any amendments thereafter. For the prospective guardian to be eligible for guardianship subsidy, they must be a qualified relative of the child or a qualified close nonrelated person. The caretaker family also must comply with all licensing requirements including training, background checks and the home study process. Procedures for Closing Case The following procedures are required by the Children’s Service Worker after the court has issued an Order for Guardianship and the family will not receive a guardianship subsidy: Close necessary functions in FACES such as service authorizations and KIDS account. Ensure all case information in FACES is accurate and updated. Place copy of Order for Guardianship in case record.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/mo-section-4-chapter-8-permanent-outcomes-subsection-3-guardianship
"MO :: Section 4, Chapter 8 (Permanent Outcomes), Subsection 2 – Adoption",Missouri,Rules,"2023, 2022, 2021","Adoption, Permanency, Termination of parental rights",,,"Adoption offers the most stability to the child who cannot return to their parent(s) and is the second most legally binding permanency plan. Adoption should be considered an appropriate permanent plan when: The goal of reunification has been ruled out There is clear, cogent and convincing evidence that one or more grounds for TPR exist and CD has determined that there are no compelling reasons not to file a TPR. The evidence for these grounds must be clearly documented in the case record The parent(s) has failed to correct those problems and or conditions which contributed to the child’s placement in out-of-home care and are not likely to do so in the near future The parent(s) wants the child to be adopted, or termination of parental rights has been completed or is being pursued The child wants to be adopted Termination of parental rights has serious and lasting consequences to parents and children. Therefore, it is often difficult for Children’s Service Workers and others to recommend termination of parental rights. Conversely, courts may be hesitant to terminate parental rights. However, section 211.447, RSMo, sets forth the grounds for involuntary termination of parental rights and should be used by the worker and others in deciding when to recommend termination of parental rights. If the worker is unsure whether statutory grounds for filing an involuntary TPR exists in a case, the worker may request that their supervisor request a case consultation with a Division of Legal Services attorney. Once TPR occurs, a child is potentially available for adoption until court releases the Division from custody and/or supervision of the child.

The worker shall continue to provide any specialized treatment services needed to maintain family stability and prevent recurrence of the behaviors, which resulted in the original placement. Preparing the Resource Provider As a member of the FST, the resource provider participates in making significant decisions in the child’s life. The resource provider will also assume an active role as mentor and helper to the parent to facilitate a successful family reunion. The goal of reunification should not come as a surprise to the resource provider. However, the bonds that develop between some resource providers and children are so significant that both the child and the adult may grieve the loss. Therefore, it is important that the Children’s Service Worker recognizes the signs of grieving and assists the child and resource provider through this difficult transition. The Children’s Service Worker and resource provider should discuss: Resource provider’s fears or anxieties regarding the child’s return to the parents Anticipated changes in the child’s behavior during the transition phase Resource provider’s role in helping/supporting the parent and child make the transition Updating the life book and other records maintained by the resource provider Continued contact, if any, with the child and parent Preparing the Non-Custodial Parent In preparing the non-custodial parent for reunification with the child, the Children’s Service Worker should consider the non-custodial parent’s awareness and involvement in the child’s placement, (i.e. communication and visitation and his/her previous role in the child’s life). In addition, the worker and non-custodial parent should discuss anticipated issues and methods for coping with those issues. If necessary, an aftercare plan may be developed with the non-custodial parent to ensure successful reunification. If the family/juvenile court terminates jurisdiction, legal custody will revert to the prior legal custodian. The non-custodial parent must obtain legal custody through civil court.\ Post-Reunification Support Reunification support services are critical to a successful family reunion. Reciprocal and open communication between the Children’s Service Worker, parents, child, resource provider, and external agencies providing services to the family or child is essential to identifying services needed for successful family reunification.

Review documents furnished by the parents, if any. Determine current treatment needs of individual family members and the family as a unit, and incorporate them into the Social Service Plan. Determine what progress has been made with the family’s involvement in any services or support systems. Determine if current placement provider can continue to meet the child’s and/or sibling group’s needs or if additional services are needed to maintain the placement. Inform FST members that they can have access to pertinent medical records and/or medical information of the child. Provide FST members with the CD-287 Learn Your Rights brochure. Inform the FST members if the child has been prescribed or administered a psychotropic medication as defined in Section 4, Chapter 4 (Working with Children), Subsection 3 – Medical and Behavioral Health Planning 4.3.1 Definitions.

The Initial Family Assessment of the family shall be utilized to develop a Social Service Plan, including the permanency and concurrent goals, with the family and team within 30 days of case opening. The worker shall also begin gathering information from the family, natural supports and placement provider(s) to determine the initial needs of the child(ren). These needs shall be documented in the Social Service Plan Child Section and continually updated throughout the case. If the recommendation is for the child(ren) to remain in custody, the Children’s Service Worker will involve the Family Support Team in identifying those extended family members (as well as unrelated persons) who may have had an ongoing, significant relationship with the child to determine potential placement resources for the child(ren). A preliminary visitation plan should be developed at this time to assure visitation between the child, their parents, and/or siblings.  Any documents provided to the family should be recorded on Verification of Receipt of Documents & Information (CD-301b) by an initial and date of the family. For youth age 14 and older, the Adolescent FST Guide (CD94) and Individualized Action Plan Goals (CD94) must also be completed. See Chapter 5 for more information on Older Youth. When possible, with the best interest of the child in mind, arranging for the child to continue to attend the same school should be discussed during the 72-hour Family Support Team meeting. 30-Day Family Support Team Meeting – The Family Support Team (FST) meets within 30 days to solidify the Social Service Plan , finalize the Initial Family Assessment, and assess progress on resolving issues that led to  removal.  By the 30 day FST, the Children’s Service Worker should have engaged all members of the team and any additional sources of information to more fully assess and document the reason(s) for Children’s Division’s involvement, the harm and impact to the child(ren), everyone’s worries, the threats of harm, safety goals, the parent/caregiver/guardians protective capacities, the child(ren)’s vulnerabilities, the family’s strengths/needs, the child(ren)’s strengths/needs, next steps, along with formal and natural supports to reach the safety goals. All information gathered should be contained in the Social Service Plan and reviewed at every FST meeting. The completed Social Service Plan should be shared with the members of the team, keeping in mind that appropriate releases need to be obtained and/or the information on the Social Service Plan may need to be redacted dependent on who is receiving and entitled to the information. Continual reassessment of progress towards safety goals by the Family Support Team will then determine whether the child can be returned home safely and/or what additional services are needed toward resolution of issues. 60-Day Family Support Team Meeting – The Family Support Team (FST) should review and assess progress on the Social Service plan. The Progress Assessment portion of the Social Service Plan should be utilized during every FST to gather each participants (all parents, children, natural supports, resource providers, professional supports and service providers) current response to ‘What good things are you seeing this Parent/Caregiver/Guardian doing and what progress have you observed toward the safety goal? ?’, their response to ‘What concerns do you still have regarding the progress or behaviors of the Parent/Caregiver/Guardian? ?’, their response to ‘What more needs to happen in relation to the Parent/Caregiver/Guardian behavioral changes to bring them closer to the safety goal? ?’ and any next step suggestions to help the family reach their safety goal(s). When gathering this information, be specific about documenting observed behavioral changes within the family. These individual responses, including those of the family, all natural supports, other members of the FST and Children’s Division shall be documented thoroughly in the Social Service Plan Progress Assessment section. Progress documented at the meeting will help the Family Support Team formulate a recommendation about any changes to the child’s permanency plan and placement, including reunification. 90-Day Family Support Team Meeting – Repeat from 60 day FST. Subsequent Team Meetings – Repeat from 60 and 90 day FST. 6, 12, and 18-month Family Support Team meetings – These meetings must be held prior to six months from the date the child entered care, and then every six months thereafter for as long as the CD maintains custody.  The purpose of these meetings is to determine: The safety, health and well-being of the child and their adjustment to placement The continuing necessity for and appropriateness of the placement The extent of compliance with the case plan The extent and progress which has been made in alleviating or mitigating the causes necessitating placement in foster care The quality and compliance of the visitation plan To project a likely date by which the child may be returned to and safely maintained in the home or placed for adoption or legal guardianship Review of educational stability of the child Discussion of normalcy and age-appropriate activities the child has been involved in All information provided at meetings or administrative hearings regarding removal of a child is confidential except: A parent or a party may waive confidentiality for himself or herself. Any parent has the absolute right to record or videotape such meeting to the extent allowed by the law. No parent or party shall be required to sign a confidentiality agreement before testifying or providing information at such meeting or hearing. Any person, other than a parent or party, who does not agree to maintain confidentiality, may be excluded from any portion of the meeting during which he/she is not testifying or providing information. The Children’s Service Worker should ensure that accommodations are made for any special needs of Family Support Team members (i.e., English as second language/sign language interpreters, accessibility for physical disability or handicap). Placement Stability FST Meetings A team meeting shall be held prior to taking any action relating to a change in placement of a child in the Division’s custody. The FST should review the Foster Family Profiles of potential resource providers in determining and selecting the most appropriate placement for the child. When the welfare of a child in the custody of the Division requires an immediate or emergency change of placement, CD may make a temporary placement and shall schedule a FST meeting within 72 hours of the temporary placement. The purpose of the placement stability FST is to: Help stabilize the child in the current placement by considering the factors contributing to the request for change of placement and addressing those specific factors with the placement provider; Assess the child’s placement needs, the needs of the placement provider, and identify additional supports or services to maintain the placement; Discuss the need for a different placement only if the current placement cannot be maintained, and evaluate service and treatment needs prior to selecting the next placement provider; Determine the most appropriate placement for the child and ensure that the receiving placement provider has all the information about the child and child’s family (per Section 210.566 RSMo) as well as the services identified by the Placement Stability FST prior to the transition; Discuss the child’s educational needs and work with local school districts to ensure the child remains in the current school district when possible. Educational stability should be a priority when assessing the child’s placement needs and making placement decisions; and Reduce the amount of placements for the child and increase child stability. Separation of Siblings FST meetings An FST meeting is to be held prior to the separation of a sibling group. The Children’s Service Worker should document that reasonable efforts were made to place the sibling group with the same placement provider, and why such placement was not possible.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/mo-section-4-chapter-7-family-support-teams-subsection-1-types-family-support-team-meetings

TPR Not Granted: If the Court denies the petition the worker should evaluate the reasons the court gave for the denial and take appropriate actions, including reevaluating the permanency plan for the child. The worker should promptly schedule an FST to determine an appropriate case plan. Such discussions in the FST should include evaluation of appropriateness of the concurrent plan. If the Court denies the petition and the child was in the custody of the Children’s Division the Division may have the right to appeal the decision to the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court. The decision whether or not to file an appeal must be made in conjunction with the Circuit Manager and the Division of Legal Services. An appeal must be filed within 40 days of the date of the Court’s order denying the petition. To pursue an appeal the Division of Legal Services must prepare and submit a referral to the Attorney General’s Office. If the Division wishes to consider pursuing an appeal the Division must refer the matter to DLS no later than 10 days from the date of the entry of the Court’s order. If the appeal is not filed with the court in a timely manner the judgment becomes final and, in most circumstances, cannot be appealed further. If costs are assessed (such as attorney fees), against the Division, payment must be processed within 30 days. If there is a question about whether the Court has the authority to assess the costs or attorney fees against the Division, or whether the amount charged to the Division is reasonable the worker should initiate a referral for legal advice to the Division of Legal Services (DLS). Court rules impose time limits on the ability of the Division to challenge such orders once they are entered. In most cases challenges must be filed with the court within 30 days of the date of the entry of the Court’s order. The worker and the supervisor must therefore process such DLS referrals on an expedited basis. NOTE:  Section 211.444, RSMo, states: “The written consent required by subsection 1 of this section shall be valid and effective only after the child is at least forty-eight hours old and if it complies with the other requirements of Section 453.030, RSMo.” Related Practice Alerts and Memos: 2-18-20 – PA20-CM-01 – Termination of Parental Rights Referral Form",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/mo-section-4-chapter-6-working-parents-subsection-5-termination-parental-rights-654-outcomes

When the Family Support Team determines that the child’s best interest would be served by pursuing involuntary termination of parental rights, the Family Children’s Service Worker should take the following steps: Review termination of parental rights statutes (Section 211.442 – 211.487) and determine if case information is consistent with TPR grounds for an involuntary action. In cases where the worker or supervisor are uncertain about whether there is a legal or factual basis for filing a TPR petition they should refer the case to the Division of Legal Services (DLS) for a legal consultation through the DLS referral process. CD workers should not be consulting the Juvenile Officer, Juvenile Officer’s attorney, the GAL or other private attorneys for legal advice. Advise the parents of the decision and explore with them the prospects of voluntary relinquishment of their rights. If the parent is represented by an attorney, the worker should not discuss this issue with the parent without first notifying the attorney and asking whether the attorney has any objection to the worker discussing the prospects of voluntary relinquishment of their rights. If the attorney has objections then the worker should work through the attorney. If the worker is represented by DLS the worker should request that the DLS attorney initiate this process. If the parent does not have an attorney the worker should refer the parent to local legal services. Submit a written report in accordance with local juvenile court policy. The Family Children’s Service Worker should document: Efforts expended to identify and locate parents, Services provided to each parent, i.e., intensive in-home services, drug/alcohol assessment, counseling and/or group meetings, parent aid services, family and/or individual counseling, parent training; Response of parent(s) to services, i.e., did parent attend as required, did parent actively participate, has parent demonstrated improved abilities or skills as a result of services; Assessment of child’s needs, i.e., is continuing relationship with birth parent positive or negative for child, prospects for adoption; and Rationale for recommendation, i.e., even if given more time and more services, parents will not in foreseeable future be in position to assume care and custody of child. Receive written decision from juvenile officer regarding intent to file TPR petition: Follow up with a letter requesting decision if written decision is not received within 30 calendar days. All Ordered Evaluations and Reports Shall be made available to the Court 15 Days Prior to the Dispositional Hearing or as Ordered by the Court. Assure DLS attorney is unavailable to file the TPR petition If juvenile officer declines to file petition for involuntary termination of parental rights, cases should be reviewed through supervisory channels. If an adoptive staffing has occurred, a family has been identified for the child, and there are no other competing petitions anticipated or filed, consult the family regarding their willingness to proceed with a petition for adoption and termination of parental rights. If it is determined the adoptive family will, through their attorney, file the petition for TPR and adoption, an Agreement for payment of Litigation Costs in Termination of Parental Rights Cases is appropriate. The worker will make contact with the central office Adoption Unit to initiate the request for an agreement. If petition for involuntary termination of parental rights is filed by the juvenile court, Division of Legal Services or the prospective adoptive parent(s) attorney, cooperate with local juvenile court requirements for interrogatories, depositions, appearances, testimony, etc. Pursuant to section 210.145, RSMo; “16 In any judicial proceeding involving the custody of a child the fact that a report may have been made pursuant to sections 210.109 to 210.183 shall not be admissible. However, nothing in this subsection shall prohibit the introduction of evidence from independent sources to support the allegations that may have caused a report to have been made.”  This means that the fact that the Division has substantiated a hotline report is not admissible in evidence as grounds to support a TPR petition and it should not be a stated ground for filing a TPR petition. The statute, however, expressly permits the use of the underlying evidence to support the allegations which may have caused a report to have been made. This means, for example, that the fact that the division may have a substantiated finding that a parent sexually abused the child is not admissible to prove the child was sexually abused. It is proper, however, for the party to plead and introduce evidence on the fact that the child was sexually abused from independent evidence such as the child’s statements, witness testimony, medical evidence and evidence from the counselor or the therapist. This provision of the law is to limit harassment reports. However, as a result, staff may be denied the ability to enter some evidence. If this becomes an issue, staff may consult with DLS. Collect parental background information, i.e., ethnic/cultural/religious heritage, physical description, health, education, etc. Once case is concluded, obtain copy of any orders entered.

It may come from expectant mothers who wish to place their infant for adoption or parent(s) of one or more children. It may come from parents involved in a child abuse neglect case. It may come from parents involved in private child custody or child support case. When a birth parent approaches the worker about executing a voluntary consent to termination of parental rights the Children Services Worker should determine the basis for the parent(s) request. The worker should inform the parent(s) of the full range of alternatives for providing for the child including services available through the Children’s Division and other agencies and community resources. The worker should explain to the birth parent that deciding whether to sign to sign consent to TPR is a very significant step which has and permanent legal and social consequence for the birth parents, the child and the extended family. The worker should inform the parent(s) that the worker is not giving legal advice about whether or not it is in the birth parent’s legal interests to sign consent to TPR form.  The worker should advise the parent to consult with an attorney before the parent makes a decision to agree to a voluntary termination of parental rights. If the parent does not have an attorney the worker should refer the parent to the legal aid office which covers the area and any other resources such as the Missouri Bar Lawyer’s Referral Service ( www.mobar.org ). The worker should carefully document in the record what information was provided to the parent and that the worker advised the parent to seek independent legal advice before signing the consent. The parents should be given sufficient time to carefully think through their decision and to consult with an attorney. If the parent of the child is a minor, or the worker has information which would indicate that the parent is under a disability which may make it difficult for the parent to understand the legal and social consequences of signing a consent to termination of parental rights, the consent to termination of parental rights may be invalid unless additional procedures are followed. If any of these circumstances apply the worker should refer the matter to DLS for legal advice on what legal procedures may be appropriate. Once voluntary relinquishments become the plan, the following steps should be completed: Written consent forms, authorized by the local juvenile court, should be completed and signed in accordance with court policy. It is preferable that the parent’s attorney be present when the forms are signed. If a custody order is required, follow local juvenile court requirements for obtaining one. Cooperate with local juvenile court requirements for letter/report, interrogatories, depositions, appearances, testimony, etc. Collect parental background information, i.e., ethnic/cultural/religious heritage, citizenship or immigration status, physical description, health, education, etc. It is also important to determine whether the child may have Native American ancestry and whether notice to the tribe is required by the federal Indian Child Welfare Act.

As used in this subdivision, a ‘child’ means any person who was under eighteen years of age at the time of the crime and who resided with such parent or was related within the third degree of consanguinity or affinity to such parent’ or; The child was conceived and born as a result of forcible rape. When the biological father has pled guilty to, or is convicted of, the forcible rape of the birth mother, such a plea or conviction shall be conclusive evidence supporting the termination of the biological father’s parental rights; or The parent is unfit to be a party to the parent and child relationship because of a consistent pattern of committing a specific abuse, including but not limited to, abuses as defined in section 455.010, RSMo, child abuse or drug abuse before the child or of specific conditions directly relating to the parent and child relationship either of which are determined by the court to be of a duration or nature that renders the parent unable, for the reasonably foreseeable future, to care appropriately for the ongoing physical, mental or emotional needs of the child. It is presumed that a parent is unfit to be a party to the parent-child relationship upon showing that: within a three-year period immediately prior to the termination adjudication, the parent’s parental rights to one or more other children were involuntarily terminated pursuant to section 211.447 subsection 2 or 3 or section 211.447 subdivisions (1), (2), (3) or (4) of subsection 4 or similar laws of other states.

Pursuant to 211.447.7, when considering whether to terminate the parent-child relationship, the court shall evaluate and make findings on the following factors, when appropriate and applicable to the case: The emotional ties to the birth parent; The extent to which the parent has maintained regular visitation or other contact with the child; The extent of payment by the parent for the cost of care and maintenance of the child when financially able to do so including the time that the child is in the custody of the division or other child-placing agency; Whether additional services would be likely to bring about lasting parental adjustment enabling a return of the child to the parent within an ascertainable period of time; The parent’s disinterest in or lack of commitment to the child; The conviction of the parent of a felony offense that the court finds is of such a nature that the child will be deprived of a stable home for a period of years; provided, however, that incarceration in and of itself shall not be grounds for termination of parental rights; Deliberate acts of the parent or acts of another of which the parent knew or should have known that subjects the child to a substantial risk of physical or mental harm. The disability or disease of a parent shall not constitute a basis for a determination that a child is a child in need of care, for the removal of custody of a child from the parent, or for the termination of parent rights without a specific showing that there is a causal relation between the disability or disease and harm to the child. Considerations Based on Child’s Best Interest When considering whether to terminate the parent-child relationship the court shall consider all relevant factors of the child’s best interest including: The emotional ties to the birth parents The extent to which the parent has maintained regular visitation or other contact with the child The extent of payment by the parent for the cost of care and maintenance of the child when financially able to do so including the time that child is in the custody of the division or other child-placing agency Whether additional services would be likely to bring about lasting parental adjustment enabling a return of the child to the parent within and ascertainable period of time The parent’s disinterest in or lack of commitment to the child The conviction of the parent of a felony offense that the court finds is of such a nature that the child will be deprived of a stable home for a period of years; provided, however, that incarceration in and of itself shall not be grounds for termination of the parental rights Deliberate acts of the parent or acts of another of which the parent knew or should have known that subjects the child to a substantial risk of physical or mental harm The judge shall make written findings of fact and conclusions of law in any order pertaining to the placement of the child. Section 211.444 allows the court to terminate parental rights of a child if it finds that termination is in the best interest of the child and the parent has consented in writing to the termination. Paternity: It is imperative to identify any man/all men having/claiming interest in the child. Men having an interest could include alleged father, man named by mother as biological father of child; putative father, man who claims to be biological father of child; and, legal father, man, if applicable, married to mother at time child is conceived. See sections 210.817 to 210.853 and 193.225 to 193.325 of the Missouri Revised Statutes for information on establishment of paternity. Section 211.447 allows any person to make a referral to the juvenile office for the termination of parental rights and establishes grounds for termination. This section also requires the juvenile officer or the Division to file a petition for termination of parental rights in certain circumstances.

"MO :: Section 4, Chapter 6 (Working With Parents), Subsection 5 – Termination Of Parental Rights :: Intro",Missouri,Rules,"2023, 2022, 2021","Adoption, Legal process, Permanency, Termination of parental rights",,,"Termination of parental rights should be considered only after full efforts have been made to return the child(ren) safely to a parent. These proceedings may be initiated upon the request of the child’s parent(s) (voluntary relinquishment) or by any other person, including CD, making a referral to the appropriate juvenile office. In certain circumstances the Division is authorized to file a petition for termination of parental rights without making the request to the Juvenile Officer with the assistance of Division of Legal Services. The Family Support Team, in assessing a child’s needs for permanency, should consider termination of parental rights if permanency through reunification with a parent and if adoption is a reasonable expectation and meets the child’s needs. Once it has been determined that TPR and adoption will become the case goal, the Division shall still be required to make reasonable efforts toward reunification (unless an order from the court states otherwise).  As part of the effort to prepare parents for termination of parental rights, The Division shall continue to engage the parents in discussion regarding changing roles and relationships that may occur between the parent and child, discussion of plans for visitation/ family time that are in the best interest of the child(ren) and planning for the immediate future and referral for needed services. The Division shall continue to provide referrals to parents for requested services. These services are based on the specific parent’s needs and may include grief counseling or other efforts to ease the transition during this time. Additionally, parents should receive education on issues related to confidentiality, search and reunion, the Divisions should document any plans for the parent’s participation in the adoption process, when appropriate and desired. Termination of parental rights may be a simple legal process when all parents to the child are identified, located and voluntarily relinquish their parental rights. Conversely, termination of parental rights may be a time consuming and complex legal matter if one or both parents object to his/her parental rights being terminated. In all cases the facts and grounds for termination must be proven by legally admissible evidence in a court of law. Grounds for termination of parental rights must be proven to the court by clear, cogent and convincing evidence. This is the highest standard of proof known to the civil law. It is essential, that all of the facts supporting a termination of parental rights are carefully and thoroughly documented. Individual courts may interpret the involuntary termination statues differently or be reluctant to pursue premature termination of parental rights. Staff may consult with the Division of Legal Services in addition to the juvenile officer on all cases where involuntary termination of parental rights is being considered by the Family Support Team. When considering a petition for termination of parental rights the court must apply a two part analysis: first, the court must determine whether there are statutory: “grounds” for termination in the case under consideration: and second, if the petitioner proves that the statutory grounds exist, whether termination of parental rights is in the best interests of the child. The court may deny a petition for termination of parental rights if the court finds that TPR is not in the best interest of the child even if there are statutory grounds for termination. However, the court cannot grant a petition to terminate parental rights if the petitioner failed to prove by clear, cogent and convincing evidence that the statutory grounds for TPR exist. Section 210.720 states: In the case of a child who has been placed in the custody of the children’s division in accordance with subdivision (17) of subsection 1 of section 207.020, RSMo, or in another authorized agency, by a court, or has been placed in foster care by a court, every six months after the placement, the foster family, group home, agency, or child care institution with which the child is placed shall file with the court a written report on the status of the child. The court shall review the report and shall hold a permanency hearing within twelve months of initial placement and at least annually thereafter. The permanency hearing shall be for the purpose of determining, in accordance with the best interests of the child, a permanent plan for the placement of the child, including whether the child should be continued in foster care, whether the child should be returned to a parent, guardian or relative, or whether proceedings should be instituted by either the juvenile officer or the Division to terminate parental rights to legally free such child for adoption.

These issues include, but are not necessarily limited to: Change in parents’ lifestyle, particularly if they have not had any child care responsibility How current family relationships might be affected Child’s behavior,(i.e., feelings of separation and loss from resource provider, testing rules and limits) Child may compare parents to resource provider Child must adjust to new community and school Child may feel insecure and be “clingy” due to fear of another separation from parents and Parents may have periods of uncertainty about their ability to adequately meet the child’s needs. As the time for the child’s return nears, visits between parent(s) and child should be more frequent and of longer duration (i.e., overnight, weekends, etc.). Also, the parent(s) will likely need additional support during this time. The Children’s Service Worker should attempt to meet face-to-face with the parent(s) at least once per week in the home during this transition phase.

Title XIX MO HealthNet should be open from the time the child enters foster care until the court terminates jurisdiction or returns legal custody to the parents unless the family requests it be closed earlier. The Children’s Service Worker will need to ensure the parent receives the MO HealthNet card to use for the child. If applicable, the worker should encourage the parent to apply for medical insurance benefits through Family Support Division for the child, if needed, prior to the termination of jurisdiction to ensure that there is no disruption in insurance coverage for the child. If the child is going to be approved for MO HealthNet coverage through FSD, the worker should inform the FSD worker when the court is going to terminate jurisdiction or returns legal custody to the parents so they can coordinate the closing of the Alternative Care Client Information screen, SS-61 in FACES with the opening of Mo HealthNet in FSD.Family Support Division staff will not be allowed to open the child’s Medicaid eligibility if the child has an active AC function in FACES.

Both announced and unannounced visits should be utilized. The majority of visits should occur in the parent’s home environment.  The parent’s home is the place they are living, as defined by the parent. Examples of the majority include: If a case has been opened 6 months during October 1 thru September 30, 4 out of the 6 required visits during that time frame must be in the parent’s home. If a case has been open for only 2 months during the Federal Fiscal year, 2 visits must occur in the home as the majority of the visits are required in that setting. If a case has been opened 5 months, 3 of the visits held with the parent must be in the parent’s home During these visits the worker should discuss, through use of the Social Service Plan, the progress of the case, the safety of the child (including safety networks and how they are being utilized), and the parent’s own situation. Updates about treatment activities such as therapy and other services should be discussed and documented using the Monthly Contact Form (CD-300). Notes about parent home visits: If a parent’s rights have been terminated, they no longer are required to be visited. However, there may be situations such as with older youth, that visitation or contact with the that parent is warranted When a parent is incarcerated either locally or through the Department of Corrections, a phone call (including video calls) will count as a visit in that parent’s home If a parent is living in a county outside of the case manager’s county, the parent still must be visited in the home the majority of the time.

Within 24 hours of the child being taken into protective custody, Children’s Service Worker will meet with the parents. The Children’s Service Worker should also determine, at opening of the case, if either biological/legal parent is incarcerated in a Missouri Department of Corrections facility, a local correctional facility, an out-of-state correctional facility or a federal prison.  The Children’s Service Worker should also obtain information regarding the length of the sentence and possible amount of time required to serve the sentence.  The worker should visit the parent (or attempt phone contact with an incarcerated parent) to ensure a smooth transition between workers. All parents should be given the opportunity to be involved in the assessment process, using the Initial Family Assessment and, if necessary, the Initial Family Assessment Attachment, to begin building the Social Service Plan. It is important to assess each parent to obtain a thorough understanding of the family functioning. During this meeting the worker shall provide and explain to the parents the Handbook for Parents of Children in Alternative Care, CS-304, which is written to assist staff in providing this information to parents.  Additionally, the CS-132 (Know Your Rights Brochure) shall be provided at this time.  Parents who are incarcerated should have each of these items mailed to them at the facility, along with the Notice to Incarcerated Parent, CS-2.  The Children’s Service Worker should also attach the Parent Response Form, CS-2 ATT, and include a self-addressed stamped envelope.  All documents provided to parents will be documented on the Verification of Receipt of Documents & Information form by asking the parent to initial and date. The purpose of this meeting is to provide the parents/caretakers with as much information as possible about what will be happening with their child and to engage them in the decision-making process. Continuous parental involvement, including all parents, throughout the child’s placement is significant in early and successful reunification. It is important to remember the majority of families do not voluntarily seek assistance from the Division. The family may view the Children’s Service Worker as an unwelcome intrusion into their life. The family’s perception may manifest itself in a wide range of behaviors, i.e., defensiveness, hostility, resistance, and ambivalence. It is imperative the worker examine the underlying cause of the behavior and understand the family’s reactions may be normal in view of the circumstances. The worker should try to put themselves in the family’s position and think about how they might react in similar circumstances. The following items provide some guidance on topics to discuss with parents: The Children’s Service Worker explains his/her role as helper to the family. The worker will assist the family to identify and resolve those issues which lead to the out-of-home placement of their child Using the Initial Family Assessment, and if necessary, the Initial Family Assessment Attachment, to begin development of the Social Service Plan with the family. The worker will identify the allegations that brought the child(ren) into care, the allegations adjudicated that prevent the child(ren) from safely returning home and the behavioral changes necessary to ensure safety of the child(ren). Each parent and each child shall be individually assessed, their needs and services identified and progress toward behavior changes documented thoroughly throughout the case. These components shall be documented on the Social Service Plan. The Social Service Plan will help lead the family and team through all the components of a forward-focused plan and help bring clarity for the team around the harm, danger and next steps that are determined with the family to help support a successful outcome. Utilizing the Social Service Plan as a foundation of conversations throughout the case is important to maintain focus on behavioral changes observed in the family to keep the children safe and reduce potential risk of harm. Engage the parent to allow them to express their view of the situation Ask how the family has managed up to the time of intervention including what worked and what did not work The parent and family’s perception of their cultural identity Explore with the parent the whereabouts of the other parents and relatives that may be able to assist the family and become part of the safety network How trauma may influence the parent and family When engaging with parents the focus should be on what must change before the child can safely return home. Ask what in-home safety interventions may be put in place to assure that the child is safe. Initial discussions about safety networkers should be held. The Children’s Service Worker should obtain the name of the incarcerated individual and the address of the facility.  This information is available for public use through the Missouri Department of Corrections (DOC) website, at http://www.doc.mo.gov , under the “Offender Web Search” link.  The Offender Web Search application allows users to search by either the offender’s DOC ID or the offender’s first and last name.  The information provided includes a general description such as height, weight, race, and sex, as well as Assigned Location, Active and Completed Offenses, and Aliases.  If the offender has been released from prison on probation or parole, the assigned Probation/Parole Officer will be listed.  All Missouri adult correctional facilities and Probation & Parole offices can be found on the DOC website above under the “Facility Locator” link. This introductory contact between the Children’s Service Worker and family is the foundation for establishing a team with common purpose and goals. As with any other team member, the parent must feel that they are a part of the solution rather than simply complying with the mandates of others. The family Children’s Service Worker also explains that the family (all parents/child(ren)) will be members of a Family Support Team (FST). He/she explains that the purpose of the team is to assist the family to determine their strengths and needs and what type of plan is necessary for the child to return home.

The law also requires the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) to develop a data collection system to track the independent living services provided to youth and to develop outcomes that measure States’ performance in preparing youth for their transition from foster care to independent living.  To meet this requirement, ACF published a proposed rule in the Federal Register in July 2006 and issued a final rule in February 2008.  The data collection system is called the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD). The NYTD regulation requires States to engage in two data collection and reporting activities. First, States collect and report basic demographic data on each youth and the independent living (IL) services provided to them by the State in thirteen broad categories: independent living needs assessment academic support post-secondary educational support career preparation employment programs or vocational training housing education and home management training budget and financial management health education and risk prevention family support and healthy marriage education mentoring supervised independent living room and board financial assistance education financial assistance Life Skills services may be provided for collection and reporting in one of the following ways: Through the Chafee provider if the youth is enrolled. Through the CD Contracted TLP provider if the youth is enrolled through CD. Through TLP services provided via Foster Care Case Management Agencies and reported by the Children’s Service Worker. Through the foster parent or other community service provider if arranged by the Chafee or TLP. Through the foster parent as part of their services and entered by the child’s Children’s Service Worker. Through a community service provider if arranged by the youth’s Children’s Service Worker and entered by the youth’s Children’s Service Worker. Through the youth’s Children’s Service Worker if completed with the youth on a visit. Second, States conduct a baseline survey of youth in foster care at age 17 and conduct a follow-up survey with these youth at ages 19 and 21 to collect and report information about the following youth outcomes: financial self-sufficiency experience with homelessness educational attainment positive connections with adults high-risk behavior access to health insurance States collect the outcomes information by conducting a survey of youth in foster care on or around their 17th birthday. States track these youth as they age and conduct a new outcome survey on or around the youth’s 19th birthday; and again on or around the youth’s 21st birthday. States collect outcomes information on these older youth after they leave the State’s foster care system, regardless of whether they are still receiving independent living services from the State when they are 19 or 21 years old .  All States collect and report outcome information on a new cohort of youth every three years.  All outcome information with the exception of demographics must be obtained directly from the youth and reflect the youth’s provided response and not information obtained from other agency databases. The state will survey youth who reach their 17 th birthday every third year thereafter. The table below illustrates an example of the timeframes utilizing cohort numbers from inception of surveying: Fiscal Year of Implementation All youth receiving services Baseline Outcomes (17-year-olds) Follow-up Outcomes (19-year-olds) Follow-up Outcomes (21- year-olds FFY 2019 X X (Cohort 3) FFY 2020 X X (Cohort 4) FFY 2021 X X (Cohort 3) FFY 2022 X X (Cohort 4) FFY 2023 X X (Cohort 5) FFY 2024 X X (Cohort 4) FFY 2025 X X (Cohort 5) FFY 2026 X X (Cohort 6) The survey consists of 21 questions in which the answers must come directly from the youth. For those youth still in care, the youth’s Children’s Service Worker will be responsible for ensuring that a survey is completed via one of the methods outlined below and entered into FACES.  For youth who need assistance completing the survey, the youth’s Children’s Service Worker should assist with this to ensure survey completion.  For example, if a youth is incarcerated and the youth can be located, the youth could be interviewed by phone. Options for youth to complete survey: At age 17: In person with the Children’s Service Worker. The Children’s Service Worker may enter the survey at the time of completion in FACES, upon return to the office or may submit the survey by mail to the FACES Help Desk. Surveys must be completed within 45 days of the youth’s 17 th birthday in order to be compliant. Completed electronically via a survey link sent to the youth by email.  With this option there is still the expectation the youth’s case manager will meet with the youth regarding the survey.  To send an email to the youth with the survey link, the case manager must add/verify the youth’s email address on the Case Member screen. Once an email is added/verified to the case member screen, the email displays on the NYTD Survey Online Response Tracking (NYTD Tracking) screen next to the youth on the listing. The NYTD Tracking screen includes a ‘Send Email’ button. Once the case manager verifies the email is correct on the NYTD Tracking screen, the ‘Send Email’ button is selected to generate an email to both the youth and the case manager. The email is sent to the case manager as verification the email went through. However, if any individual accesses the NYTD Tracking screen and selects “Send Email” this action will send an email to the youth and the individual completing the action. The email contains a link that when selected will open up the NYTD Older Youth Online Survey specific to the youth. Once the youth completes the survey and clicks submit, the survey responses are saved. At age 19 or 21: Completed electronically by the youth within the six month reporting period from web-based link sent to the youth’s email account. Completed electronically by the youth within the six month reporting period from a letter sent to youth’s last known address containing information on an electronic link to complete survey. Paper copy sent to youth and completed by the youth within the six month reporting period and sent to Central Office for entry in postage paid envelope. Paper copy completed by youth during home/office visit and entered by youth Children’s Service Worker. Surveys must be completed within the six month survey period for the 19 and 21 year old cohorts however, ideally the survey is completed at the beginning of the survey period to ensure the state is compliant. Youth engagement is an important element of successful survey participation.  The NYTD Tips and Reminders available on the CD intranet Older Youth Program page provides additional assistance. By utilizing resources available through the Division, such as Chafee, MO HealthNet and the community, youth who are currently in out-of-home care or left the legal custody of the Division will be: Better prepared to meet the challenges they face on their road to self-sufficiency and independence; Will understand the importance of their role and personal responsibility to self and community; Will be more aware of community resources and how to access them if needed; and Will be able to develop their own support system to enable them to transition successfully to independence.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/mo-section-4-chapter-5-older-youth-program-subsection-12-national-youth-transition-database

For youth who are Missouri residents but are attending an out-of-state school or on a visit outside of Missouri, the out-of-state provider must be willing to enroll in the MO HealthNet program for services to be covered.  Per federal requirements, Medicaid cannot be opened in two states at the same time. When a youth exits CD custody, the case manager will close the Alternative Care Client case in FACES, in order to capture the exit data in our information system.  Upon closing, the system will automatically calculate eligibility and open the Health Care for Former Foster Care Youth coverage the following day, if eligible. Staff should enter the youth’s current address once this occurs. Eligible youth receiving MO HealthNet services through Family Support Division (FSD) will continue with their current health care coverage.  If the youth receiving FSD coverage becomes ineligible for health care through FSD, FSD will close its coverage and the Health Care for Former Foster Care Youth coverage will automatically open. If the former foster care youth already has health insurance or obtains health insurance from another source such as employment, this private or commercial insurance becomes primary and MO HealthNet will serve as secondary coverage. Youth living in Missouri who exited foster care in any other state are eligible for the Health Care for Former Foster Care coverage to age 26 if they: Exited foster care in another state at the age of 18 or later, and are not yet 26; Have documentation from the state they exited foster care verifying they were in foster care and receiving Medicaid coverage at the age of 18; and Are determined ineligible for other mandatory coverage through FSD, such as MO HealthNet for Pregnant Women, MO HealthNet for the Aged, Blind or Disabled, etc. The Family Support Division determines eligibility for youth living in Missouri but who exited foster care in another state. Whether a former foster care youth makes contact with a county office and asks about the extended coverage, or staff otherwise learn a former foster care youth from out-of-state is under age 26 and is uninsured, staff should refer the individual to the designated Older Youth Transition Specialist (OYTS) for that region. Provide the OYTS the youth’s name, date of birth, current address, phone number and email. The OYTS will contact the youth to gather additional information before referring the youth to designated Family Support Division staff for eligibility determination.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/mo-section-4-chapter-5-older-youth-program-subsection-11-aftercare-program-5112-health-care

Youth may also contact the Division for services after they have left care. There may be several avenues former foster care youth take to return to the Division for services.  Youth may directly contact their former Children’s Service Worker or Older Youth Transition Specialist.  Youth may come to the Division for assistance through Family Support Division (FSD) or referrals from other agencies (e.g., homeless shelters, Workforce Development, etc.).  Once a youth contacts the Division for services, a referral for Chafee Aftercare Services should be made via the Referral – Chafee Aftercare Services screen in FACES.  The Older Youth Transition Specialist will refer the youth to the contracted Chafee provider in the region of the youth’s residence and open the youth as an LS-8 in the Chafee Foster Care Program (CFCP) Aftercare screen.

Each county office should have Exit Packets readily available to give to youth.  The Exit Packet should contain MO HealthNet information, the Chafee Aftercare Pamphlet, an Education and Training Voucher (ETV) brochure, MO Reach brochures, the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) Pamphlet, Re-Entry pamphlet, and any additional resources pertinent to their own local communities. Upon leaving care, a letter signed by the child’s case manager shall be provided to the youth on state letterhead verifying the youth’s time in care and exit date. This will aid youth in receiving assistance after leaving care within the state and out of state for services that require eligibility verification.  This is referred to as the “verification letter” and can be found in e-forms under CD-276, Custody Verification Letter. When the young adult’s first contact with the agency after leaving care is through FSD, the FSD worker shall follow procedures instructed through the Income Maintenance memorandum, IM00-191, dated December 27, 2000, on the process of collaborating with or referring the young adult to Children’s Division (CD). FSD staff will refer the young adult to the Children’s Division (CD) liaison/contact person for former foster care youth during the application process. If the liaison/contact person is not available in a county, then the CD supervisor will be responsible for the assignment of the referral. In the absence of, or if there is not a CD supervisor based in the county, the assignment of the referral shall be the responsibility of the Circuit Manager. The assigned CD staff shall meet with and provide the young adult with the CFCP Support Application, CS-ILP-4, to complete. When completed, the form will provide the following information: Identifying information for the young adult; Current housing situation and household composition; Educational level and completion; Employment and salary information; Current and outstanding bills; Medical/mental health needs and access; Available family/community resources; Current/future needs; Ability/inability to reach self-sufficiency and continued independence; Present and future goals; and Willingness to accept personal responsibility. Upon making contact with the young adult and receiving information of the young adult’s need for Chafee Aftercare services, the CD county liaison/contact person for former foster care youth shall immediately notify the Older Youth Transition Specialist assigned to their county by faxing or mailing the CFCP Support Application, CS-ILP-4, to the Older Youth Transition Specialist. The Older Youth Transition Specialist shall open the youth in the Chafee Foster Care Program (CFCP) Aftercare screen as an LS-8 youth and complete the Referral – Chafee Aftercare Services screen. The CFCP contracted agency will assist the young adult in designing a plan that is realistic and supports their efforts to become self-sufficient or to continue to live independently.  The agreement shall be updated or renegotiated as often as needed.  In the event of a crisis, if the Older Youth Transition Specialist is not accessible, the county liaison/contact person for former foster care youth may contact the Older Youth Transition Specialist’s supervisor.  Even in a crisis situation, the county liaison/contact person for former foster care youth will follow the procedure of referring the young adult to the designated Older Youth Transition Specialist by notifying available Older Youth Program staff.  The Older Youth Transition Specialist or Older Youth Program staff shall immediately follow up with the county liaison/contact person for former foster care youth involved with the young adult.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/mo-section-4-chapter-5-older-youth-program-subsection-11-aftercare-program-5111-referral-and

Commonly called “Re-entry,” this legislation is intended to give youth once in custody, but no longer in custody, a second chance. In making a determination on whether the Children’s Division should petition for re-entry, the main considerations should be the youth’s present circumstances, willingness to participate in services and work towards independence, and the Children’s Division’s ability to provide services to address the youth’s needs. Youth seeking re-entry will likely be struggling and may have outstanding debt as a result of decisions made while not in custody. He/she may be in crisis and as a result, not employed, going to school, or otherwise performing tasks to work towards independence; consequently, a decision on whether or not to file a petition for re-entry should not be based solely on current circumstances of youth or lack of efforts, and uncooperativeness while in Children’s Division care and custody the first time, although they may be taken into account. If it is deemed to be in the best interest of the youth, the youth may have his/her custody returned to the Children’s Division through a petition to the Court. The petition may be initiated by the youth, Children’s Division, or Juvenile Officer.  Youth requesting re-entry through contact with a Foster Care Case Management Contractor, Specialized Care Contractor or service provider are to be directed to the Children’s Division office in the community where they currently reside. The petition may be filed: In the court that previously exercised jurisdiction, In the county where the youth resides, or An adjacent county. When a youth returns to the custody of the Children’s Division, normal case-opening procedures will be followed. A new case is to be opened in FACES. A pop up will appear on the case member screen indicating the youth has a role of child but is over age 18 however the case may be open as this is information only. All case management services the youth would have received had she or he remained in care such as placement, adult support, and clothing allowances. The youth may request a Guardian Ad Litem. Court hearings will be held every six months and as necessary while the youth is in care. Services should be provided by the previous case manager when possible and agreeable to the youth if returning in the original jurisdiction. If the youth was previously case managed by the Children’s Division, these services are the responsibility of the Children’s Division where the youth now resides. If the youth was previously case managed by a Foster Care Case Management Agency and returns within the service region served by that agency, the youth should be assigned to the Foster Care Case Management agency for case management. When a youth comes into the office seeking re-entry, it is imperative that the information on the CS-ILP-4 be fully completed and contact information for the youth be provided. A conversation should be held with the youth to determine if the youth is in need of re-entry or aftercare services, if the youth is willing to comply with services, and what services are expected. Youth should provide alternate numbers for contact of where he/she can be reached and of those who will know how to contact him/her. Division of Legal Services will need to know if the youth is employed, where the youth is staying, if the youth wants to go to school, and if the youth understands what coming back into custody means. This should be documented on the CS-ILP-4. The person sending the referral to Division of Legal Services should follow-up within one week of the date of the referral and subsequently as needed. For the purpose of re-entry, a youth is a person who meets all of the following criteria: any person age 17 through 20 who was previously placed in the care, custody and control (LS-1) of the Children’s Division; was released from care, custody and control within the last 24 months; is otherwise competent, and not in a guardianship or conservatorship, and is not in the custody of any other individual or institution; is not incarcerated or committed to any jail, detention facility, or the Department of Corrections. Youth will work in conjunction with the Children’s Division for services to be provided and will: participate in and comply with any transition plan developed by the Children’s Division, Family Support Team, and the youth; meet with his/her Children’s Services Worker, the Juvenile Office representative, and Chafee Provider, as required; participate in any services provided such as Chafee and Transitional Living Program Services; enroll in and attend a “secondary school program of instruction” or an “institution of vocational or higher education,” if determined the program will benefit the youth in his/her efforts to achieve independence. find and maintain employment to supplement the youth’s transition plan work to maintain his/her own efforts toward independent living. The Children’s Division may amend the transition plan from time to time in conjunction with the Family Support Team, as it is in the best interests of the youth. The Children’s Division may request to be relieved of custody when: The youth is unwilling or unable to develop, implement, or otherwise cooperate with the implementation of the transition plan; The youth pleads or is found guilty of any felony, or any misdemeanor in which the youth is sentenced to a period of incarceration; The youth is committed to the custody of any sheriff or the Department of Corrections; Any other circumstance where the youth fails to cooperate with the Children’s Division or the Children’s Division does not have services available or the ability to provide services. If a youth is returned to the Children’s Division custody under section 211.036, and the Children’s Division is consequently relieved of custody for any of the above reasons, another petition will not be filed by Children’s Division on behalf of the youth.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/mo-section-4-chapter-5-older-youth-program-subsection-10-re-entry

However, if guardianship/conservatorship may be the best plan for the youth then a referral should be made to the Division of Legal Services (DLS) to staff the case for legal advice. The legal advice DLS provides is confidential to the Children’s Division. Communication with DLS should begin one year in advance to allow review of the supporting documentation, preparation and filing of legal documents and obtaining a hearing date as matters of guardianship/conservatorship are determined through a court hearing. Evidence must be submitted on the youth’s current mental and physical status and current ability to care for him/her without assistance in order for a determination to be made. The burden of proof is on the person who is seeking to have a guardian/conservator appointed for the respondent, to prove the respondent is totally or partially incapacitated or totally or partially disabled. Therefore, it is essential the medical/professional evaluation meets the requirements of incapacitation.  Guardianship or conservatorships involve time, expense, and continuing court supervision. The guardianship referral and assessment information should be sent to DLS no later than 6 months prior to the youth’s anticipated transition from foster care. The following items regarding the youth must be provided to the Division of Legal Services: DLS Case Referral form Documents Copy of the original Jurisdictional Order; Copy of the most recent court order retaining youth in custody; Current (within the last six months) evaluation/report from physical and mental health medical professionals evaluating the physical and psychological ability of youth to care for himself/herself. Including a statement of the current diagnosis and prognosis; Medical records from all medical professionals; Vocational needs assessment. Vocational Rehabilitation Services may be able to assist with this in some situations; A report/assessment by DMH and/or DHSS of eligibility and services available; Educational needs assessment and records including Individualized Education Plan (IEP), current education level, abilities and needs; Report of any other special needs; Report from child’s Children’s Service Worker of why youth requires a guardianship. Assets and/or necessities: List of youth’s current medications; The sources and amounts of any income available to the youth, including any funds such as SSI payments, OASDI, trust accounts, employment, etc. The estimated value of the youth’s real and personal property (furniture, clothing, DVD’s, CD’s, computer, TV, etc.). The county in which the property of the youth, or a major part thereof, is located. Parties and/or witnesses: The names and addresses of child’s parents and any other adult relatives involved in child’s life including siblings or grandparents. Adult in this instance means anyone 18 years; The name and address of the current placement; The length of time youth has been in current placement; The name of the child’s Children’s Service Worker who works with the youth on a day-to-day basis. There may be additional information DLS will need depending upon the facts of a particular case. The DLS attorney assigned to the case will let the child’s Children’s Service Worker know if additional information is needed. It is imperative all information needed to file a guardianship/conservatorship petition is sent to DLS in a timely manner or DLS will not pursue a guardianship/conservatorship. A clear aftercare plan is needed in order for youth to transition from care into a guardianship or conservatorship successfully after the age of 21. As jurisdiction of the juvenile court and Children’s Division terminate on the youth’s 21 st birthday, planning must begin well in advance of the date of the youth’s 21 st birthday or the date the guardianship is needed to go into effect.

Planning documents which may assist with this process include: Power of Attorney Durable Power of Attorney Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare Possible court actions include: Guardianship Conservatorship Limited guardianship Limited conservatorship The Execution of a Power of Attorney, Durable Power of Attorney, and Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare These documents allow someone to appoint another person to make decisions for him or herself. To execute a power of attorney, durable power of attorney, or a durable power of attorney for healthcare, the youth cannot be disabled or incapacitated. Each of these documents allows the youth to appoint another person, called an attorney in fact, to make certain decisions on his or her behalf. The decisions which can be made by the attorney in fact must be specified in the power of attorney document.  A durable power of attorney for healthcare allows the attorney in fact to make specified healthcare decisions, which may include the decision to withhold or withdraw life prolonging procedures.  Employees of the Department of Social Services and Department of Mental Health are prohibited by law from being appointed as an attorney in fact unless the employee is closely related to the youth. A power of attorney which is not durable expires in the event the youth becomes disabled or incapacitated. A power of attorney which is not durable also expires at the end of one year or when specified in the document if earlier than one year.  A durable power of attorney or durable power of attorney for healthcare does not expire in the event of disability or incapacity and may be of such duration as specified in the document or after the death of the youth when probate issues are resolved. The Missouri Bar has available “ Durable Powers of Attorney ” and “ Guardians and Conservators under Missouri Law ” resource guides and an accompanying HIPAA form which further explains this option. The decision on whether a youth wishes to execute a power of attorney of any type is an important legal decision with important consequences. If the youth is competent to make his/her own decisions and is competent to execute a power of attorney the youth should be given an opportunity to consult with his/her guardian ad litem or his/her own attorney for legal advice before the youth is asked to sign a power of attorney of any kind.  DSS/CD personnel need to be careful to avoid giving legal advice on this issue to the youth involved. Guardianship and/or Conservatorship A guardianship may be pursued by CD/DLS for a youth between the ages of 18 and 21 when the youth has a physical or mental condition so serious the youth cannot make decisions for the youth’s own safety and well-being. A conservatorship may be pursued when a youth between the ages of 18 and 21 is unable due to a physical or mental condition to effectively manage his or her financial resources.  A guardianship and conservatorship often are pursued together, but obtaining both a guardianship and a conservatorship for the youth may not be necessary in all cases.  A guardianship or conservatorship may be full or partial depending on the extent of the physical or mental condition of the youth. A guardianship, under Missouri Law Chapter 475, is when a person is appointed by the Court (typically the Probate Division of the Circuit Court) to have the physical care and custody of an adult who has been legally determined to be incapacitated. A person deemed incapacitated refers to one who is unable by reason of any physical or mental condition to receive and evaluate information or to communicate decisions to such an extent he/she lacks capacity to meet essential requirements for food, clothing, shelter, safety or other care such that serious physical injury, illness, or disease is likely to occur. A conservator is a person or a corporation, such as a bank or trust company, appointed by the Court (typically the Probate Division of the Circuit Court) to manage the property of an adult who has been found to be disabled. A disabled person is defined as one who is unable by reason of any physical or mental condition to receive and evaluate information or to communicate decisions to such an extent the person lacks ability to manage his/her financial resources. In limited guardianship, the judge must specify the extent of the powers and duties of the limited guardian in order to allow the ward to care for himself to the maximum of his ability. The intent is to design the guardianship arrangement to encourage the development of maximum self-reliance and independence of the ward and should be considered before full guardianship. Limited conservatorship is much like limited guardianship, except conservatorship deals strictly with the estate (property and financial resources) of the protectee. If a limited conservator is appointed, the judge must specify his powers and duties in such a way as to permit the person with a disability to manage his resources to the fullest extent of his ability. Furthermore, appointing a limited guardian and/or limited conservator does not impose any legal limitation on the person except for what is specified in the court order. An adult incapacitated or disabled person may designate his or her own guardian and/or conservator if he or she is able to communicate a reasonable choice to the court. Also, any competent adult person can designate a suitable person to serve as guardian or conservator if done in writing and witnessed by at least two witnesses within five years before the hearing.  This is typically done in a durable power of attorney.  If the incapacitated or disabled adult does not have a preference, or is unable to express a reasonable preference, the court will consider appointing as guardian and/or conservative, in order: spouse, parents, adult children, adult brothers and sisters, other close adult relatives. The Family Support Team should follow this list of preferences. Only when there is specific evidence a family member is unable to serve as guardian and/or conservator should the team consider alternative providers.  The team should also consider the appointment of an appropriate kinship resource if a suitable family member is not available.  If there are no relatives or kinship resources willing or able to serve, the court has the power to appoint any suitable person (such as a close friend).  The court may also appoint the Public Administrator, an elected county official whose job is to handle such matters when no one else is available.  A person does not have to be a resident of Missouri to qualify for appointment as a guardian or conservator but this may be taken into consideration by the court when determining who may be suitable.  If they are out of state, they do have to appoint a “resident agent” within the state to serve in the case the out of state guardian cannot be reached. Any person who knows another person may require a guardian and/or conservator can commence the process by filing an application in the Probate Division in the county where the alleged incapacitated or disabled adult resides. The person alleged to need a guardian and/or conservator is called the respondent. Both the petitioner and respondent must be represented in court by an attorney. The court will appoint an attorney for the respondent if the respondent does not have an attorney. After a hearing, the court will decide whether a guardian and/or conservator are needed and make the appointment, if necessary. Notice of the application must be served to: the alleged incapacitated or disabled person, his or her spouse, parents, children or other close relative over the age of 18 years; any person acting in a representative capacity with respect to any of the respondent’s financial resources; any person having care and custody of the respondent. If the court has made a finding of total disability and incapacity, the person is presumed to be incompetent for all legal purposes. Guardians must always act in the best interests of the ward. The guardian of an incapacitated person is responsible for the physical custody of the ward and must make decisions about the ward’s care, treatment, shelter, education, support and maintenance. Guardians may give legal consent for medical treatment of the ward. Guardians must report to the court at least annually on the ward’s physical condition. A conservator is responsible for protecting and managing the protectee’s financial assets. The conservator must properly and prudently invest the protectee’s assets, apply those assets to the protectee’s care and maintenance, and account to the Probate Division for all monies received and expended on behalf of the protectee. Most expenditures on behalf of the protectee must be authorized by prior court order. Guardians and conservators are not personally liable for the debts and obligations of a ward or protectee, so long as they make it clear they are acting on behalf of the ward or protectee in a representative capacity. However, any unauthorized use or misappropriation of the ward/protectee’s property by either the guardian or the conservator will render them liable and result in their removal. Guardianship and conservatorship for an incapacitated and disabled person may terminate when the ward/protectee is found to be competent by the court. It may also be terminated if the court determines the guardian or conservator is not following the duties and responsibilities required by law. Anyone, including the incapacitated or disabled person or someone on their behalf may, at any time, petition the court for a change in who is guardian/conservator, or to increase or decrease the powers outlined in the letters of guardianship or conservatorship. The court may also accept resignations of the guardian or conservator. The court may issue an order terminating guardianship or conservatorship or the order appointing a guardian or conservator may expire unless the court orders an extension of the appointment. Conservatorship may terminate if the assets of the protectee are completely exhausted. Authority is also terminated upon the death of the ward/protectee. Coordination should occur with the Department of Mental Health and the Division of Developmental Disabilities if the youth is currently receiving services or involvement is necessary. Some youth receiving these services while in care may not need continued care or a guardianship arrangement.

"MO :: Section 4, Chapter 5 (Older Youth Program), Subsection 9 – Exit Plan :: Intro",Missouri,Rules,"2023, 2022, 2021, 2020","Exit from care, Expectations for care",,,"The goal of an exit plan is to identify and arrange anticipated services for older youth who are in the process of transitioning out of foster care. Youth who have a comprehensive transition plan are better equipped to transition successfully from foster care to self-sufficiency.  An unintended consequence of not preparing youth to exit from foster care is the youth becoming homeless.  Exit planning is the result of preparation for transition from foster care and although certain steps are taken at “exit” the planning begins at age 14.  Exit planning and transition planning should be viewed as occurring concurrently and interchangeably. Exit planning should be viewed as a collaborative effort between the youth, staff and Family Support Team (FST) members to ensure needed services are in place or the youth is aware of how to access services in their community prior to release. Transition planning should be a purposeful, organized and outcome-oriented process designed to ensure the youth’s quality of life.  Transition and exit planning should be considered a continuum once the youth is eligible for the Older Youth Program. The Council on Accreditation standards requires agencies to provide youth transitioning to independence with at least six months advance notice of the cessation of any health, financial, or other benefits which will occur at transition/case closing. Transition to adulthood can involve complex issues and create anxiety for the youth. To assist with the process, youth involvement in their plan as well as recognizing the youth’s desire to have personal independence and find their own way is essential.  Involving the youth’s other connections and community partners in the process to ensure services are accessible, coordinated and appropriate are also necessary. In order to prepare youth for their exit from the foster care system, the child’s Children’s Service Worker must plan to meet with the youth to complete exit planning ninety days prior to release from custody. The child’s Children’s Service Worker is responsible for meeting with their youth to complete the exit plan interview. The Adolescent Family Support Team Guide (CD94) and Individualized Action Plan Goals (CD94) should be updated to reflect the youth’s plan for successful transition from foster care. Consideration and planning must be conducted for youth who will continue to need supported care after transition to adulthood. The least restrictive environment which will meet the youth’s physical and mental health needs should be considered by the Family Support Team.  For youth with special needs, coordination should occur at least one year in advance with the Department of Mental Health, Division of Developmental Disabilities, Vocational Rehabilitation, Department of Elementary and Secondary Education and other state and local resource providers if the youth is currently receiving services or involvement is necessary.  Some youth may require continued formalized support in the form of guardianship or conservatorship.  In these instances, it is very important to begin transition planning with the Division of Legal Services at least one year in advance to assure the youth will have a plan and funding in place for those supports and services needed. Considerations: The planning process must consider and address all of the following factors: Source of income Educational needs Vocational needs Financial needs, including eligibility for income maintenance programs, credit status needs Legal status needs, including whether a guardianship, conservatorship or other legal custody order is necessary or appropriate Transportation Peer support Caring adult/mentor Family information and involvement Residence Safety concerns Physical health needs Mental health needs Insurance coverage needs (health and automobile as appropriate) For youth with special needs who will require funding upon release: Ensure an application is made for the youth’s Medicaid to be transferred to the Family Support Division. Kids Account income: The Children’s Service Worker should check the KIDS/Dedicated KIDS Account screen in FACES or contact FACES Payment Unit to determine the savings limit due to the youth (up to $999.00). Once an amount is determined, the Children’s Service Worker should complete a CS-KIDS-2 form for the person (payee) to whom money is to be released from the child’s KIDS account.  This person(s) may be the child’s parent, guardian, adoptive parent or him/herself, if an emancipated minor. Ensure youth is provided and assisted with Older Youth Change of Payee Request Form if the youth is receiving Social Security benefits. For additional information, refer to the Child’s Income Disbursement System (KIDS) section in the CWM. The Older Youth Exit Packet and Personal Documentation Checklist is available in e-forms for additional guidance. Upon leaving care, a letter signed by the child’s Children’s Service Worker shall be provided to the youth on state letterhead verifying the youth’s time in care and exit date. This will aid youth in receiving assistance after leaving care within the state and out of state for services which require eligibility verification. A summary of the youth’s plans should be filed in the Older Youth Program Section of the case record as well as a copy of the eligibility verification letter. As staff work with youth who are nearing, or past, their 18th birthday and opting to exit from custody, it is imperative these youth are made aware of resources available to them upon release. The child’s Children’s Service Worker shall inform these youth of their eligibility for MO HealthNet, and, if possible, determine the address where the youth will reside upon leaving care. Each county must designate a liaison/contact person(s) for those youth who have exited care to contact. An Exit Packet is to be provided to those youth currently in care as they exit the foster care system, or to former foster care youth requesting Aftercare services. The Exit Packet includes information regarding: MO HealthNet Chafee Aftercare Education and Training Voucher (ETV) Missouri Reach Tuition Waiver and Credential Completion and Employment Programs Healthcare Treatment Decisions The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) Re-entry Older Youth Change of Payee Request Form if the youth is receiving Social Security benefits. Each county should also include additional resources pertinent to their own geographic areas into the packet. Resources may include, but should not be limited to the following: Employment Agencies; Service/Volunteer Organizations for Mentoring; Faith-Based Resources; Clothing Resources; One-Stop Centers; Transportation Resources; Child Care Resources; Emergency Housing Assistance; Food Pantries; Community Action Agencies; Adult Education Programs; Income Maintenance Programs/Resources; Medical Clinics; and Other State Agencies. Former foster care youth will be required to enroll into a MO HealthNet Managed Care plan for their physical healthcare, if they reside in a geographic area covered by Managed Care. Their behavioral healthcare will be provided on a fee-for-service basis. Further Considerations Some documents are useful as youth develop life skills to prepare them for successful transition and should be obtained as needed and appropriate for the youth’s age and placement type prior to release from care.  Youth should have the following documents in their possession (with a copy in the file) as they prepare to transition from care: Original Birth Certificate Original Social Security Card An up-to-date credit report Financial statements from financial institutions in which youth has an account Driver’s license or ID Card Information regarding any policies of insurance the youth may have access to An accounting showing disposition of all monies received and distributed under the youth’s KIDS account Portfolio and Lifebook Documentation of tribal eligibility or membership Previous placement information Medical Records (e.g. immunizations, current medications) Educational Records (e.g. diplomas, report cards, IEP, list of schools attended) Original documentation of immigration, citizenship, or naturalization, when applicable Death certificates when parents are deceased Religious documents and information A list of known relatives, with relationships, addresses, telephone numbers, and permissions for contacting involved parties A resume, when work experience can be described CD-276, Custody Verification Letter Documentation of receipt of exit packet and personal documents shall occur on the Older Youth Exit Packet and Personal Documentation Checklist.

Because youth in legal custody of the Children’s Division experience challenges in developing long term supportive relationships with trusted adults, they are less likely to have an appropriate co-signer when opening a bank account.  The experience of managing a bank account when youth begin working or handling their own money is an important developmental experience which can help prepare them for independence as adults.  This statute and policy ensure that being in the legal custody of Children’s Division is not a barrier to the opportunity of having a bank account and provides protocol for Children’s Service Workers with youth seeking to open a bank account. Per RSMo 431.056, youth ages 16-17 in the legal custody of Children’s Division may open a checking or savings bank account with the consent of the Children’s Division or the Juvenile Court without a co-signer, and “The minor shall be responsible for paying all banking related costs associated with the checking or savings account and shall be liable for any and all penalties should he or she violate a banking agreement. No state department, foster parent, or entity providing case management of children on behalf of a department shall be responsible for paying any bank fees nor liable for any and all penalties related to violation of a banking agreement.” When a qualifying youth wishes to open a bank account, the Children’s Service Worker must provide a signed consent letter CD-277 verifying that they are in legal custody of the Children’s Division.  This letter will be presented by the youth to the banking institution where they wish to open a bank account.  A paper or digital copy of the letter should also be placed in the youth’s record. The Children’s Service Worker should also ensure that education is provided to the youth about the various types of accounts available and the risks associated with banking, and give the youth the “Checklist for Opening a Bank or Credit Union Account” published by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  For youth who are enrolled in Chafee Services, and applying for a bank account, the Children’s Service Worker should identify and add financially related goals to the youth’s Adolescent FST Guide and Individualized Action Plan.  Examples of banking related goals can be found in the Casey Life Skills Resources to inspire on pages 34-35. Additional financial empowerment training can be found on the ELC. A letter of consent should be provided to the youth upon request unless there are documented physical or mental conditions which would prevent them from entering into other legal contracts.

Building and maintaining credit is vital to successful transition from foster care. Information on credit reports is used to evaluate applications for credit, employment, insurance, and renting a home. Monitoring credit reports is one of the best ways to discover identity theft. For youth who turn age 14, 15, 16 and 17 while in care or come into care at age 14, 15, 16 or 17, the credit history will be obtained by Central Office. Staff will receive notification on their youth via e-mail that the information was submitted through an agreement with TransUnion. This is the date staff will be record on the Adolescent Family Support Team Guide (CD94). Staff will be notified if there are credit discrepancies and/or inaccuracies but will not receive a “report” for youth age 14-17. For youth age 18 and older, free credit reports from three nationwide consumer credit reporting companies can be requested online at AnnualCreditReport.com , by phone at 1-877-322-8228, or by completing the Annual Credit Report Request Form and mailing the completed form to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 303048-5281. All three reports may be requested at once or ordered one at a time. Ordering separately allows monitoring of credit more frequently throughout the year. AnnualCreditReport.com is the only authorized source for the free annual credit report that can be obtained per the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Because the information in credit reports is used to evaluate applications for credit, insurance, employment, and renting a home, the information needs to be accurate and up-to-date. Any information regarding a youth with a credit history should be shared with the youth. For 18, 19, and 20 year olds there may be legitimate negative items due to late payments or debts. Regardless of the reason steps should be taken to help resolve these issues if possible. The Children’s Service Worker should assist youth in interpreting the credit report and resolving any inconsistencies. Information to assist with interpretation and education can be found on the Federal Trade Commission’s website. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, both the credit reporting company and the information provider (the person, company, or organization that provides information to a credit reporting company) are responsible for correcting inaccurate or incomplete information in reports. When reviewing the report with youth, if there are accounts that are not recognized or information that is inaccurate, there is concern for identity fraud. Identity fraud is when a consumer whose means of identification or financial information is used or transferred without authorization from the consumer. Examples of concern would be credit cards that the youth has not opened, utility bills in the youth’s name that were prior to the youth residing on his/her own, or car purchases if the youth does not have a vehicle. If the Children’s Service Worker suspects identity fraud, the Family Support Team and the Division of Legal Services (investigations and/or litigation section) should be consulted to determine if an investigation or referral to law enforcement is necessary. If the youth’s identity has been compromised the worker should send a referral to the Division of Legal Services so the necessary legal steps to correct the problem can be taken. Notice should be provided to the youth’s Juvenile Officer and Guardian Ad Litem about the report findings. If there is a need to further educate youth regarding credit, Children’s Service Workers should address this on the Adolescent Family Support Team Guide (CD94) and Individualized Action Plan Goals (CD94) by creating new goals. The Chafee provider will assist with identified tasks of the new goals. The Adolescent FST Guide (CD94) should be updated to reflect that the credit report has been received on a yearly basis, beginning when the youth turns 14 or comes into care after age 14 and each subsequent year thereafter while in foster care. All documentation pertaining to the credit checks should be filed in the Older Youth Section of the youth’s record i.e. request form, credit report, e-mail correspondence from Central office. As this is life skill teaching, documentation of this service should also be included on the NYTD Older Youth Services and Financial Expenditures Screen in FACES.

The Self-Developed Case Plan for Independent Living Arrangement is used to assist with preparation and budgeting for an initial ILA placement. The Independent Living Arrangement Checklist is completed each time a youth is being considered for an ILA. After reviewing, the CM/PM will indicate whether the placement constitutes an ILA per the criteria in the Child Welfare Policy Manual. A decision as to whether the placement meets ILA criteria should be determined within 30 days after the checklist is initially received. If a youth is determined to not meet the criteria for an ILA placement based on the Independent Living Arrangement Checklist or not adequately prepared based on the Self-Developed Case Plan for Independent Living Arrangements, the coding shall not be used and another placement type sought. If the youth is placed in an ILA after meeting the criteria, the Independent Living Arrangement Checklist is reviewed quarterly by the case manager and the supervisor during case consultation. If the placement does not meet the criteria for an ILA, and the family support team or court wishes to pursue the living arrangement, a different placement code will need to be used (i.e. RHU, CTO, etc.). Prior to placement of a youth, appropriate County Children’s Services staff or contracted case agency staff must approve the suitability of the residence. Staff shall use the TLP Advocate and Independent Living Arrangement (ILA) Checklist, CS-TLP-1, which provides a procedure for documenting health and safety requirements specific to an older adolescent placed in an ILA.

This level of contact helps to improve outcomes and successful transition of youth exiting state custody. It is critical that the case manager assist the youth in identifying and accessing resources to enhance the prospects for success in the ILA. Specifically, the case manager, youth, and other family support team members should identify, to the extent possible and appropriate, the following support systems: Medical/dental services; Educational/vocational training programs/options; Employment opportunities; Emergency contacts within the agency; Family supports; Religious supports; Community sponsor/mentor; and Others as needed.

Whatever option is selected by the youth, it must be stable and safe and in a community setting that allows the youth full access to services and resources in order to fully develop independent living skills.  Housing options include the following: Single dwelling (house, apartment, mobile home); Shared housing; Boarding home; Dormitory (college program); or Subsidized housing (HUD-Section 8). Youth in an ILA are allowed to have roommates, however, ILA is not to be used as a substitute for a relative licensure to provide a form of maintenance for the family, including the biological parent whose rights have been terminated. Placement with a safe, supportive adult is always ideal over an Independent Living Arrangement whenever possible. If placement with an adult caregiver is the plan for the youth, another placement code should be used instead of ILA. ILA shall not be used in situations where the youth is living with a parent. Foster care is a form of substitute care for children whose safety or well-being requires they be removed from the home of their parent(s). If the parent of the foster youth resides in the resource home, the foster youth is no longer “removed from the control of his parents” per RSM0 211.011 nor is the youth “unattended by parent” per RSMo 210.481(4). Maintenance payments cannot be made to the resource provider if the child’s own parent(s) is residing in the resource home per Federal Child Welfare Policy Manual Section 8.3A.3. When youth enter into an ILA, it is an opportunity to discuss living agreements and understandings at the time of placement to promote independence, clarify new roles, and establish mutually agreed up on expectations. ILA shall not be used as a placement with friends or family members who are unable to meet licensure requirements. If an adult exercises authority over the youth or has in the past, or the youth is paying “rent” to a family member or former foster parent while residing in the same residence, this is not an appropriate ILA placement. Youth in an ILA shall not “rent” a room or apartment from a foster parent or parent.  ILA is meant to be a community setting for independence.  Renting from a parent or foster parent can result in complications as these persons have had authority over the youth in the past and leave the youth in a vulnerable position, such as homelessness, should the relationship change. A youth in an ILA shall not be providing supervision or authority over any other youth residing in the home. Consequently siblings of youth in an ILA may not be “placed” with the youth as an ILA placement. If a sibling meets all of the ILA requirements, the siblings may however reside together as housemates. For example, a 15 year old and an 18 year old may not reside together in ILA placements as a 15 year old does not meet the age requirements. However, an 18 year old and a 19 year old sibling may reside together as they both meet the age requirements for ILA. Youth working on their own successful transition from foster care should not be put in a position of having parental authority over a sibling, and youth under the age of the ILA requirements are in need of parental authority. If a youth is case managed by an agency outside of Children’s Division or Foster Care Case Management, such as the Department of Mental Health or a group home program that is not licensed but in which staff reside, this is not an ILA. Youth in an ILA should be able to manage their own physical and mental health needs on a daily basis, are able to come and go on their own, and have entered into a lease agreement to reside in the dwelling. Youth who qualify for an ILA should have a plan to exit to independence, not to the care of another agency. There are some community agencies providing services similar to transitional living program services via an apartment or a group home setting that are not licensed and contracted with Children’s Division to provide this service. These programs are not approved to provide services for youth in foster care so youth should not be placed with them and coded as an ILA. Staff in these facilities are not monitored by Children’s Division. If a youth is in need of a Transitional Living Program, a referral shall be made with an agency who is contracted with Children’s Division to provide this service. If a youth resides in a community program that provides living arrangements such as Job Corp, this is an ILA placement and the youth shall receive maintenance directly to them as they are living independently. The youth may visit a resource family on the weekend however the majority of the time the youth is residing in a program and thus it is not a foster care placement.

Youth in this type of placement receive support and guidance, but supervision is minimal.  To be considered for TLS, youth need to demonstrate the ability to make responsible decisions, maintain employment, and have a clear understanding of the financial and emotional demands of living independently.  Youth entering TLS ideally would be currently enrolled and actively participating in Chafee Program Services. A scattered site apartment is defined as a self-contained furnished (refrigerator, stove, bed, oven, table, chairs, etc.) unit with utilities (trash, sewer/water, electricity/gas, phone accessibility, etc) cooking, sleeping, and bath facilities for no more than one (1) youth per bedroom. Scattered site apartments may include apartments adjacent to other treatment programs, or sites scattered throughout the community and/or apartments clustered together.  The apartment must provide a pleasant, clean, safe and healthful environment.  Placement settings are located in community environments to allow the youth full access to services and resources in order to fully develop independent living skills. The apartment must provide a pleasant, clean, safe (including fire extinguisher and fire alarm), and healthful environment The apartment should be in good repair, including proper screening for ventilation, sufficient window coverings to assure the privacy of each client, and pest controlled.

All sleeping areas must be physically separated by gender unless otherwise pre-approved by the state agency in writing. There should not be more than one (1) resident per bedroom occupying a given living arrangement unless otherwise approved by the family support team, the youth, the state agency case manager, the provider, and the state agency. There are two types of Transitional Living Single/Scattered Site Apartment services: A structured Transitional Living Single/Scattered Site Apartment service is defined as a support being available for the youth to contact twenty-four (24) hours per day and the youth is visited, at a minimum, every seventy-two (72) hours in the youth’s living arrangement. An unstructured Transitional Living Single/Scattered Site Apartment service is defined as a support being available to the youth upon request of the youth and the youth is visited a minimum of one (1) time per week. At least one (1) such visit each month is in the youth’s living arrangement.

In addition, the child’s Children’s Service Worker will submit the Residential and Specialized Placement Referral, CS-9, to their supervisor as part of the referral packet.  The CS-9 must have been completed within the last thirty days. A life skills assessment tool of the Children’s Service Worker’s choice should be completed to assist with youth engagement, assessment, and goal development.  The Adolescent FST Guide (CD94) and Individualized Action Plan Goals (CD94) must have been completed within the last six months. It is the responsibility of the child’s Children’s Service Worker to update the youth’s case in FACES showing a placement type of TLS, with the vendor number of the TLS facility and a maintenance code of no maintenance. NOTE: This is not an ILA placement; therefore, maintenance payments are never paid directly to the youth.  Payment is always made directly to the provider for the youth.  The case manager should be sure that the Alternative Care Client Information Screen reflects no maintenance payment.  If a youth has a child, the child’s Children’s Service Worker would then pay monthly CYAC payments to the youth through a FACES Payment Request (PR).

Transitional living experiences for youth are vital.  The purpose of the transitional living program is to provide a living environment in the best interest of the youth that provides a path for the youth to transition from alternative care to self sufficiency and achieves the outcome of preparing the youth to live independently. The transitional living program is designed to provide youth with more independent types of living arrangements and programs. The transitional living program is distinct as the focus of the program is on life skills teaching while providing housing versus behavioral modification or assistance with emotional health care needs and is intended to serve youth who will exit the foster care system to live on their own.  Services complement the youth’s own efforts to achieve self-sufficiency and to assure that youths recognize and accept their personal responsibility in preparing for and making the transition from adolescence to adulthood. When youth enter into a TLP, it is an opportunity to discuss shared living agreements and understandings at the time of placement to promote independence, clarify new roles, and establish mutually agreed up on expectations. Adolescence is a time of testing, not only one’s abilities but others’ abilities as well. It is a time of trial and error.  Our out-of-home care youth need to be allowed to make mistakes and to learn by natural consequences.  Staff and care providers are to assist the youth with coping and learning from their successes and deficits. When youth in out-of-home care make mistakes, staff and care providers need to exhibit patience, support and guidance. Youth need to feel the security that we will not give up on them, rather, we will work with them as they learn how to live and function in the adult world. Ideally, TLP offers the youth the opportunity to transition smoothly from a more restrictive environment to a less restrictive setting based on the readiness of the youth. TLP allows the youth to apply what has been learned in their life skills teaching to actual daily living.  Based on the particular needs of the youth, they may progress from one setting to another but may enter or exit any living situation at any time when it is felt by staff and the youth that they are ready for a change. When a youth is not successful, staff and care providers should assess the current needs of the youth and modify the case plan accordingly. It is hoped the majority of issues will be resolved in the current placement.  As a last resort, a youth may be returned to a more restrictive setting and receive remedial services as needed.  When the youth is ready to progress again, TLP placement may occur.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/mo-section-4-chapter-5-older-youth-program-subsection-4-transitional-living-program-intro

The product of an assessment is an agreement.  It gives youth the chance to tell their story.  The youth’s independent living competencies will be identified using the life skills assessment tool of the Children’s Service Worker’s choice and the Adolescent FST Guide (CD94) and Individualized Action Plan Goals (CD94).  The purpose of a life skills assessment is to provide the youth, youth’s caregiver, and case manager comprehensive information which will assist the youth with preparing for self-sufficiency. The assessment is to be used in conjunction with other information available to focus specifically on those areas of the youth’s life that are, or will, impact on their preparation for self-sufficiency.  The assessment will assist in gaining understanding of the youth’s strengths and challenges so practical, concrete efforts can be made to achieve the youth’s goals. Adolescent FST Guide (CD94) and Individualized Action Plan Goals (CD94) These tools are comprehensive documents used to guide team members through the Family Support Team (FST) process. The plan will identify the youth-specific team members, the identified individuals for a youth support system, goals for the youth and life skills assessment and continued evaluation. The Individualized Action Plan Goals (CD94) takes the place of the Written Service Agreement if reunification is not the goal and goals can be geared toward life skills and transition. If reunification is the goal, the Individualized Action Plan will be used in conjunction with the family’s Written Service Agreement.  The form will be completed according to the age of the youth.  This is an assessment tool to aid in determining life skills needed and obtained and will aide in documentation.  It is also a tool to capture a thorough assessment of the youth as well as teach life skills.  The entire form does not need to be completed at once.  It is a living document which will be updated constantly throughout the youth’s time in care. The Individualized Action Plan goals and expectations provide the framework for life skills instruction. It is designed to help youth acquire knowledge and understanding about a life skill and then apply the life skill to real life situations.  The individualized action goal represents the overall goal for instruction, and the expectations describe what the youth should be able to do after instruction takes place. The Individualized Action Plan Goals (CD94) can be developed using the life skills assessment tool of the Children’s Service Worker’s choice. The Adolescent FST Guide (CD94) and Individualized Action Plan Goals (CD94) are to be completed within 60 days of a youth coming into care after the age of 14 or turning 14.  The Adolescent FST Guide (CD94) and Individualized Action Plan Goals (CD94) should be started in the first thirty days of a youth coming into care after the age of 14 or turning 14 in conjunction with the youth by the case manager.  It is an on-going document and is presented at Permanency Planning Reviews in conjunction with the Child Assessment and Service Plan, CS-1.  For youth eligible for Chafee in an adoptive or guardianship placement, the family will update the form with assistance of the Adoptive or Guardianship Case Manager and the revised Guide and Plan will be updated in FACES at least every six months. Individual Life Skills Progress Form (CD95) This is a form used to record performance of youth in achieving life skills by using a Likert scale of Got It, Working On It, or Needs Assistance. It is completed through direct observation of the youth’s work during and just after instruction has taken place and helps the youth appreciate what has just been demonstrated.  Together, the youth and the instructor decide where the youth is on the three-point scale.  It also provides the agency with historical data on the youth’s life skill overall development.  This form is completed monthly by the person teaching life skills.  If the youth is not referred to Chafee Program Services or is not in a Children’s Division contracted Transitional Living Program, this is the Children’s Service Worker’s responsibility. The Portfolio This document is a collection of samples that communicate a youth’s interest and give evidence of the youth’s talents. It is used to show others what the youth has accomplished, learned, or produced.  The portfolio is created during life skills instruction and is guided by the learning goals.  Performance is observed and recorded on the Individual Life Skills Progress Form (CD95) so staff may see the concrete results of instruction.  The portfolio process involves the appreciation and evaluation of one’s work.  Portfolio items are completed for each life skill instruction. Some helpful guides for ensuring youth receive the supports and services they need at the ages they are eligible are available in e-forms and entitled “OY Services by Age” and “OY Tasks by Age.”",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/mo-section-4-chapter-5-older-youth-program-subsection-3-chafee-foster-care-program-5

Youth in an adoptive or guardianship placement that were previously referred for services continue to be eligible upon the case plan being achieved if the adoption or guardianship occurred after the age of 16. Youth that have been adopted or obtained guardianship after the age of 16 will follow the same referral process for youth in care if a referral was not previously made, Chafee services are desired, and they are still open in the Alternative Care Client Screen.  However, if a youth is closed in the Alternative Care Client Screen after the adoption or guardianship is awarded, the Chafee referral will close and a new referral will need to be made through the Referral – Chafee Aftercare Services screen if the youth is eligible and desires services.  The youth will have to be reopened in the system and will be categorized at this point as a LS-8 with a flag as an adoptive/guardianship youth in the Alternative Care Client Screen.  Although the legal status will be that of an aftercare youth, the flag will indicate to the Chafee provider that the youth is eligible for full Chafee services versus crisis care.

Transitioning youth with disabilities face the same challenges as their peers without special needs and are at higher risk for many undesirable outcomes such as poverty and victimization. Family Support Teams must consider youth with disabilities versus youth who are incapacitated. Youth with special health care needs include all children who have, or are at increased risk for, chronic physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional conditions and who also require health and related services of a type or amount beyond that generally required.  Incapacitated youth, in reference to consideration of Chafee referral, means unable to participate due to their disability. The youth is lacking the ability to engage or understand their participation. Services should be provided in a holistic manner which addresses not only their special needs but their independent needs as well. Coordination with other service providing agencies is essential in order for youth with special needs to succeed in transitioning out of care.  Youth with special needs require on-going support related to their disability as well as continued support towards self-sufficiency.  This may mean assuring the youth is receiving benefits which they are eligible for such as SSI, connecting them to resources such as Vocational Rehabilitation, or advocating on their behalf.  Youth with special needs are also likely to have or be entitled to an Individual Education Plan (IEP) under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), an Individual Written Rehabilitation Plan (IWRP) through the Department of Vocational Rehabilitation, and a plan of service care and coordination through Title V (Maternal and Child Health Bureau’s Division of Services for Children with Special Health Needs (DSCSHN)).  Depending on the extent of the youth’s needs, services may be coordination or advocacy only.  However, if the youth is able to practice new skills, these opportunities should be made available to them in a format to suit their individual needs. For youth who have been determined ineligible for referral due to disability level, it is understood the forms may not be completed with youth participation. Efforts should be made to complete the assessment tools with the youth if at all possible.  A referral for services should be made as the law requires a personalized independent living plan that is youth driven. If the youth is not able to participate, documentation of the youth’s independent living skills/functioning level should still occur on the Adolescent FST Guide (CD94) after Family Support Team discussion and decision. The Adolescent FST Guide (CD94) should be completed by the worker as thoroughly as possible and filed in the record in the Older Youth Program Section.

Missouri has broadened this to include independent living services to all youth ages 14-21. The Foster Care Independence Act of 1999 (the Act), signed into law December 14, 1999, established the John H. Chafee Foster Care Independence Program, which later became the Chafee Foster Care Program for Successful Transition to Adulthood hereinafter referred to as Chafee.  This Act directs states to include a broad range of stakeholders in the planning, coordination, and delivery of independent living services.  With the passage of H.R. 6893:  Fostering Connections and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-351) Chafee was amended to add the purpose of providing services to youth who after the age of 16 leave foster care for adoption or  guardianship. National statistics indicate about 20,000 youth emancipate from the foster care system each year when they reach age eighteen. These young people leave without emotional or financial support that families provide.  Many of these youth are not adequately prepared for life on their own.  Turning eighteen may mean the beginning of a long and solitary journey toward adulthood if they have no one to turn to for help or support. To strengthen the system of support that contributes to the safety of these young people we must: increase early and consistent access to independent living preparation skills, especially opportunities for realistic practice of life skills; ensure the active involvement of young people in the individual planning and decision-making process that will lead to successful emancipation; ensure no youth is released from foster care to homelessness; and provide access to transitional housing and longer term affordable housing options. Young people who have left foster care say the immediate struggle for day-to-day survival after leaving care makes planning for a good future very difficult. To safeguard the well-being of youth making this transition, a continuum of support and preparation must begin when the youth enters out-of-home care.  The Act enables the division to provide time-limited services and financial assistance to help these young adults as they develop the skills and education needed to move successfully into self-sufficiency and independence. Chafee services should not be used as a substitute for sound permanency planning. In this context, independent living services do not constitute a permanency goal, but form a set of services provided to older youth to assist them in their efforts in reaching self-sufficiency.  Independent Living is not an alternative to adoption for youth.  Enrollment in Chafee shall occur concurrently with continued efforts to locate and achieve placement in adoptive families.  The youth’s case goal should be driven by his/her individualized case plan. For youth who plan to enter into a post-secondary or other educational program, remaining in the state’s care and custody to continue to have access to necessary services may be in their best interest. It may appear that Chafee conflicts with the Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) of 1997. However, ASFA focuses on safety, permanency and well-being for all children, while Chafee focuses on services.  The Division can comply with ASFA and Chafee by ensuring foster care youth in Legal Status 1 have access to independent living services regardless of their current placement or permanency. In Missouri, the Older Youth Program is a set of services and supports provided to youth transitioning from foster care, regardless of case plan. The Older Youth Program incorporates Chafee and reflects the specific philosophy and services offered to youth, ages 14 and older, in the custody or previously in the custody of the Missouri Children’s Division. The Older Youth Program encompasses philosophy through positive youth development and the distinct permanency needs of adolescents. Three services are provided through the Older Youth Program:  The Chafee Foster Care Program for Successful Transition to Adulthood Program services are being provided by a contractor or Community Partnership.  Transitional Living Services are housing options and are also being provided through contracted agencies.  Independent Living arrangements are also encompassed in the Older Youth Program.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/mo-section-4-chapter-5-older-youth-program-subsection-1-mandates-and-rationale

In the majority of cases, youth are only able to access services if they are in DYS custody. However, in some cases, at the request of the circuit court, DYS may provide services for youth who have not been committed if they remain under the supervision of the juvenile court. These referrals must be handled on a case by case basis. A list of the DYS Service Coordinator Supervisors for each circuit can be found on the CD intranet. These supervisors should serve as a point of contact for CD when making referrals to DYS prior to making a recommendation to the court. Staff should invite DYS to Family Support Team (FST) meetings and court hearings when appropriate. When youth are court ordered into the joint custody of DYS and CD for the purpose of obtaining additional treatment services, the following protocol should be utilized: CD staff should send a copy of the court order through the appropriate channels to their Division of Legal Services (DLS) representative for review. All youth determined to be in the joint custody of DYS and CD should be coded in FACES as Legal Status 1. If it is determined by the DYS Service Coordinator Supervisor and CD that the youth should be placed in a DYS facility in which DYS is going to provide the cost of care, CD staff should enter a new placement and select a placement type of CTO on the placement screen in FACES. CD staff will abide by all case management activities as required for LS-1 children including visiting with the child in the placement at least once a month, regardless of the placement type. The agency with physical custody that is providing primary financial support of the youth should be the agency to open the Medicaid eligibility.       If CD has an open Title XIX in FACES and the child is to be placed in a DYS facility, CD should put an end date on the Title XIX field in FACES to allow DYS to open Medicaid for the youth. If a youth is discharged from a DYS facility and is placed in a CD placement, staff may reopen Title XIX in FACES by entering a new Title XIX begin date to allow CD to be reimbursed. Youth Transitioning from DYS to CD Custody It is also important to provide support for youth transitioning from one custodial agency to another, when there is no dual custody.

However, there may be individual cases where the Division may want to explore a request for release of jurisdiction from the court. All requests for release of custodial responsibility should be evaluated on a case by case basis by the case manager, their direct supervisor, and FST team members. During the FST meeting, there should be a thorough review of documented efforts and consideration of the following factors: The age of the child/youth The number and type of previous placements The current and concurrent case plan Whether TPR has or has not occurred The child’s/youth’s progress and compliance in cooperating with the Division’s services The child’s/youth’s run history (one time event verses chronic runs) Whether the child/youth is running to a specific place or person Is there an exit plan in place for the child/youth to provide on-going support? (See memorandum CD04-56 for details on exit planning) It is important that a youth never be released from custody without an exit plan in place as it is our responsibility to ensure that youth leaving the foster care system either have support services in place or know how to obtain them as needed in the future. Non-compliance cannot be used as the sole reason to request termination of custodial duties by the Division. With this understanding, there may be rare situations where it is appropriate to request a release of jurisdiction when it is clear that there is a documented history of chronic and repeated non-compliance on the youth’s part to accept placements and services offered by the Division or in cases where the youth has been missing without contact for a minimum of twelve months. This does not include cases where the youth has run to a non-approved placement and remains in contact with the worker. Placement issues need to be addressed by the worker, youth, FST members and the court.

Some challenges may include the following: They may not view themselves as victims. They may not trust adults due to trauma they have experienced. They may be concerned they will face legal consequences for their role in trafficking. Their trafficker may have made threats to harm the child/youth, their family, and/or friends. Traumatic bonding of the child/youth to their trafficker is often an influential factor that interferes with self-identification as a victim and in severing the child’s/youth’s relationship to their trafficker. Traffickers use power and control tactics to make their victims increasingly reliant on them for emotional and psychological needs. Children/Youth who are emotionally vulnerable due to a history of abuse/neglect are especially vulnerable to the tactics of traffickers. When a runaway or missing child/youth is located, the case manager should complete the following: Immediately assess the safety of child/youth. Notify law enforcement, juvenile office, Guardian Ad Litem, the resource provider, the child’s/youth’s parents, and parent attorney as appropriate of the child’s/youth’s return or recovery. Notify the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) of the child’s/youth’s return. Determine whether to: Return child/youth  to the previous resource provider Place child/youth in new or temporary placement Place child/youth in a more secure or restrictive environment Seek approval for non-traditional placement (i.e. friend of child/youth, older sibling, parents whose rights have been terminated but continue a relationship with child/youth.)

Schedule Family Support Team (FST) meeting within 72 hours of child’s/youth’s return to address: Safety concerns Reason the child/youth ran away  (i.e. did not like the rules, placement issues, could not handle responsibilities in home, ran to be with friends, parents, others) Additional support services the child/youth may need Unexplored or non-traditional placement options Potential changes in the child’s/youth’s case plan Document in FACES all steps taken to: Assess the child’s/youth’s experiences while absent How the child’s needs were addressed upon return (i.e. medical examination, treatment needs, CAC, etc.) Notify relevant agencies of the child’s return It is important for FST members to consider case specific information when addressing these issues or making changes to the child’s/youth’s case plan. Members should consider the specific needs of the child/youth especially when considering alternative placement settings. Any child/youth age 12 or over should be included in the FST meeting. Screening after a Youth Returns or is Recovered Federal law requires staff to determine the primary factors that contributed to the child’s/youth’s running away or otherwise being absent from care, and to the extent possible and appropriate, respond to those factors in current and subsequent placements. This law also requires staff to determine the child’s/youth’s experiences while absent from care, including screening the child/youth to determine if the child/youth is a possible sex trafficking victim. Therefore, once a child/youth is located, the case manager must talk to the child/youth about why they were absent from care and what occurred while they were gone.  The caseworker should document this conversation in FACES. Questions to ask include, but are not limited to: What made you leave your placement? Where did you go when you left? How did you take care of yourself while you were gone? Did you have money? How did you get money? How did you eat? Where did you sleep? Who helped you while you were gone? Did you have to do anything in exchange for their help? Did anyone hurt you? Did you do anything that made you uncomfortable? Are you worried about anything that happened to you while you were away? Chronic Run Away Children/Youth who have run away multiple times are at an increased risk for involvement in commercial sexual exploitation. It may be appropriate to make a referral to the Child Advocacy Center (CAC) for a forensic interview of the child/youth, even if they have made no disclosure or provided information about involvement in trafficking. Local county offices are strongly encouraged to work with their CAC to develop protocols for assessing these children/youth. Suspicion of Abuse or Human Trafficking If a child/youth provides information that may indicate they were abused or involved in trafficking, the following must occur immediately, but no later than 24 hours after receiving the information: The case manager must immediately contact the Child Abuse/Neglect Hotline Unit (CANHU) to make a report of child abuse and neglect. The case manager should inform the hotline of any suspicion of involvement in human trafficking. The case manager should ensure that law enforcement is notified of the concern. A referral to the Child Advocacy Center (CAC) should be made for a forensic interview to further explore the child’s/youth’s experiences in care if there is an indication the child/youth was abused or trafficked. The case manager may contact the National Human Trafficking Resource Center toll-free hotline at 1-888-373-7888 or make an online tip report at www.traffickingresourcecenter.org/report-trafficking .",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/mo-section-4-chapter-4-working-children-subsection-8-missing-person-report-procedure-485

The placement provider has the authority to make the initial report to law enforcement, 210.795 RSMo. Oftentimes they are the first person to become aware a youth is missing and can most efficiently and effectively initiate the report. In the event the placement provider makes the initial report, the case manager should follow up with law enforcement to ensure all necessary information was provided, including the worker’s contact information. Note: In addition to state statute, Federal law requires law enforcement to take a report of missing children/youth under the age of twenty-one (21). The missing child’s entry shall not be removed from any database or system until the child is found or the case is closed. If the local law enforcement agency refuses to take a missing child/person report, staff should contact the Missouri State Highway Patrol for assistance.

The order should contain after-hours phone numbers for whomever CD desires to be called when the youth is located. This order alerts law enforcement to the fact that a youth is under the court’s jurisdiction and is missing. The order gives law enforcement instructions to return the child to CD. The juvenile office may have the ability to enter the order into the Missouri Uniform Law Enforcement System (MULES) or the JO may need to be sent to a law enforcement agency for entry. Without this order being entered into MULES law enforcement may not have knowledge that the child is in foster care. Note: If the juvenile officer will not request a capias order staff should make a referral to the   Division of Legal Services (DLS) to request assistance in filing for an order. Staff should utilize the standard DLS case referral form and be sure to include when the youth went missing, the last time CD received communication from the youth, and any available information about their possible whereabouts. DLS information and forms are located on the DSS Intranet at https://dssintranet.mo.gov/dls/ 6.  Within 24 hours, update FACES to reflect a new temporary location of RUN.

"MO :: Section 4, Chapter 4 (Working with Children), Subsection 8 – Missing Person Report Procedure :: 4.8.2 Definitions",Missouri,Rules,"2023, 2022",Definitions,,,"Missouri statutes 43.400 – 43.410, RSMo., contain provisions for reporting missing persons to the State Highway Patrol. A missing child/juvenile is defined as “any person who is under the age of seventeen years, whose temporary or permanent residence is in the state of Missouri or who is believed to be within the state of Missouri, whose location has not been determined, and who has been reported as missing to a law enforcement agency.” A child/juvenile may be considered missing if they meet one of the following characteristics: If they have run away from the residence of a parent, legal guardian, or custodian; If they are missing under circumstances indicating that the person was or is in the presence of or under the control of a party whose presence or control was or is in violation of a permanent or temporary court order and fourteen or more days have elapsed, during which time the party has failed to file any pleading with the court seeking modification of the permanent or temporary court order. Anyone over the age of seventeen years is considered missing if they are missing and meet one of the following characteristics: Is physically or mentally disabled to the degree that the person is dependent upon an agency or another individual; Is missing under circumstances indicating that the missing person’s safety may be in danger; Is missing under involuntary or unknown circumstances; Is missing under circumstances indicating that the person was or is in the presence of or under the control of a party whose presence or control was or is in violation of a permanent or temporary court order and there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person may be taken outside of the United States. For general purposes, a foster child is considered to be missing or on run status as soon as their physical whereabouts are unknown to CD or their physical custodian. A foster child is under the care and custody of the CD and responsibility therefore lies with the CD staff, contracted service workers, and resource providers to ensure the safety and well-being to the best of their ability.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/mo-section-4-chapter-4-working-children-subsection-8-missing-person-report-procedure-482
"MO :: Section 4, Chapter 4 (Working with Children), Subsection 8 – Missing Person Report Procedure :: 4.8.1 Understanding Runaway Youth with a Trauma Based Focus",Missouri,Rules,"2023, 2022","Administrative process, Safety",,,"Children in the custody of the Children’s Division, particularly considering their trauma history, are at increased risk than other children for running away. Children may run away from any placement type, but their risk is lowest for runaway episodes when placed with family. Risk factors which increase the likelihood that foster children may run away include: frequent placement changes, entry into care as a teenager, a familial history of abuse and neglect, and a documented history of behavioral health problems. When children run away, they are at higher risk for perpetrating crimes, using drugs/alcohol, and being victimized by others. Youth who have run away are especially vulnerable to recruitment into human trafficking. Running away is often a coping mechanism or an impulsive response which may be triggered by the child’s trauma history. It is important to understand what happened prior to the runaway episode and view that through a trauma lens. For example, if a child feels unsafe, that may prompt a flight response. Some children will run away FROM something; some children will be running TOWARDS something. Engaging with the child to try and understand the underlying causes of the behavior may help the child recognize triggers. The focus should be on increasing the child’s safety, not punishing the child through restrictions that could be counterproductive. If the child ran away as a flight response to feeling threatened, assigning consequences to the child could send an unintended message that control is more important to staff than our concern for the child to resolve triggers in a healthy way. Based on the above, it is important to conduct a supportive assessment of the child’s time away from their placement as well as gain an understanding of what prompted the elopement so these factors can be addressed. Staff should make clear to the child that staff are glad they are safe and staff view the runaway episode as a signal that the child’s needs, particularly safety needs, may not be met. When conducting this assessment, provide the youth with some space and time to calm down before participating. The conversation should be held in a safe, relaxed, neutral, non-threatening environment. The questions should be open-ended, and feel relaxed and conversational, preferably conducted by someone with whom the youth has a rapport or trusts. If possible, allow the child to have others present if it would make them feel more comfortable. Staff should be caring, empathetic, sincere, nonjudgmental, and trustworthy. Youth need to feel they are being heard. The information obtained should be integrated into the child’s plan as well as the permanency plan. Integration into Service Planning First, any safety concerns while the youth was on run status should be addressed. For example: Is a medical exam needed immediately; if any illegal behavior towards the youth was experienced, does law enforcement need to be contacted? Please see Section 4.8.5 for more information about procedures when children return from run status. Additionally, research has shown that incorporating the information garnered from this dialogue into the youth’s service plan can reduce the risk of running away and reduce the frequency of placement disruption. By understanding the cause of the behavior, changes can be made to support the child’s needs. For example, staff may have restricted access to family yet the child still desires a relationship with family members. How can staff ensure safety while still increasing family contact? If the child is attempting to avoid restrictions inherent in some placements or being in state custody, staff should assess the restrictions. Risks for Runaway Youth Children who have run away multiple times are at an increased risk for involvement in human trafficking. Traffickers prey on and target vulnerabilities in their victims in order to make promises aimed at addressing the needs of their victims. The following are common risk factors for trafficking in children/youth: Being in foster care Chronically missing or frequently on the run History of childhood sexual abuse History of physical and emotional abuse Single parent home Minimal supervision Low self-esteem Lacks a strong social network Unsupervised online time Seeks online friendships and connections History of substance use issues or those living with someone with substance use issues History of school truancy",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/mo-section-4-chapter-4-working-children-subsection-8-missing-person-report-procedure-481

Explain to the Eligibility Specialist (ES) that these are CYAC parent and child. The system will notify the FSD worker when a child receives Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). Open an AC function through case intake for the CYAC child. Entry instructions can be found in the Step by Step guide under FACES information. The system will automatically enter fund code 12 or 01 (if child’s placement type is ILA) on the AC Client Information screen. Select no maintenance on the child’s Placement Information screen. The child’s eligibility and reimbursability for Title IV-E is based on the CYAC parent’s eligibility. The ES shall update the fund code to Alternative Care IV-E (02). If the CYAC parent is not eligible for Title IV-E, the ES will explore Title XIX (FFP) (12) eligibility and if needed, HDN (01) for the child. Update the Placement Information screen of the CYAC parent. Select a maintenance amount of above standard rate (if the placement is an ILA) and enter the amount (the amount will be the rate for the parent plus the standard rate for the child). The maintenance amount reported on the Placement Information screen of the CYAC parent must take the CYAC child’s income into consideration. Therefore, any income received for the CYAC child must be deducted from the maintenance amount to be paid from the SS-61. One check will be generated to the resource provider or to the CYAC parent when the placement type is ILA. If the older youth and child are placed in a foster home, or a transitional living placement, the resource provider only receives maintenance for the older youth. For foster home placements, the worker should select standard rate as the maintenance amount. For TLS and TLG placements, the worker should select no maintenance. For TLA placements, the worker should select above standard rate as the maintenance amount. Payment for the CYAC child is paid directly to the older youth via a monthly payment request. The worker will select the direct payment to client box on the payment request screen using the service code of MAIN and utilizing the parent’s DCN. In the comment box, the worker should input the CYAC child’s DCN. In transitional living placements, the contractor is responsible for providing oversight to the youth based on the youth’s specific maternity/parenting needs and ensuring the safety of the youth and child through the living arrangement. The contractor must  provide the service needs of the youth in terms of parenting such as education in nutrition, growth and development, and effective discipline. If the CYAC parent is case managed by a private agency, a payment request should be submitted to pay the CYAC maintenance and infant allowance, if applicable. The steps listed above would be followed utilizing the appropriate service code for the service being paid. Outside Income for the CYAC child – Any outside income received by the CYAC child shall not become part of the Children’s Income Disbursement System, KIDS,account. The Division Director shall not become payee for this income. Rather, the Children’s Service Worker should assist the CYAC parent in becoming payee for same. The CYAC parent is expected to use the CYAC child’s income toward the CYAC child’s cost of care. Therefore, the maintenance amount for the CYAC child will need to be adjusted accordingly on the CYAC parent’s Placement Information screen based on the amount of outside income the CYAC child receives. Monthly maintenance received by the youth is not considered income and should not be counted as outside income. Special expenses – Special Expenses for the CYAC child must be invoiced under the CYAC parent’s name and DCN using current procedures, with the exception of child care, which should be authorized using the CYAC child’s DCN.  The CYAC child has his or her own clothing allowance that is paid in addition to the child in CD Custody.  This will cause a payment error that can be overridden in the system. Eligible placements – The Alternative Care Client Information instructions identify eligible placement types that can be used for the CYAC child as well as other special instructions which must be used on CYAC child’s AC function. Division custody of CYAC child – If a CYAC child is placed in the Division’s custody, the system automatically considers the child Title XIX-FFP (12) eligible in the child’s own right. At the time the Division is given custody, the worker should update the child’s legal status to LS-1 and maintenance and special expenses would be paid, using the child’s DCN. The Title IV-E/FFP Information screen in FACES would need to be completed for the child and sent to the Eligibility Specialist for a IV-E/FFP eligibility determination. The maintenance amount on the CYAC parent’s Placement Information screen must be updated to reflect the appropriate rate. If the LS-1 child returns home on a trial home visit with their parent who is in CD custody, the parent would receive maintenance for the child. The worker would need to complete a payment request and pay maintenance directly to the client (parent). Once jurisdiction of the child is terminated, the legal status can be changed to LS-7, CYAC as long as the parent is still in care.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/mo-section-4-chapter-4-working-children-subsection-7-children-youth-alternative-care-471

(RSMo 210.265.2)   This designation applies to homes who apply to care for children for whom the agency has legal custody. Relative care is the least restrictive family-like setting for children requiring out-of-home placement. Regardless of which of the five permanency options; Reunification, Adoption, Guardianship, Placement with Fit and Willing Relative, or Another Planned Permanent Living Arrangement (APPLA), is being considered for a foster youth, relative care is the placement of preference and should, if at all possible, be pursued prior to making any other type of out-of-home placement, unless a court determines that placing a foster youth with a relative is not in the best interest of that foster youth. The court must make specific findings on the record detailing why placement with a relative is not in the best interest of the foster youth. Placement Consideration When out-of-home care is imminent, the Children’s Service Worker should ask the parent and foster youth to identify potential relative providers. After removal of a foster youth from his/her home, a list of potential relative providers should be obtained from the parents at the 72-hour Family Support Team meeting. This list and efforts to locate potential providers should also be documented in the assessment and treatment section of the case record, in Section III of the CS-1, and on the Child/Family Health and Developmental Assessment, CW103. Factors to consider in identifying potential relative foster care providers are as follows: Who would the parent and foster youth most want to care for the foster youth; Who does the parent and foster youth most often turn to in time of crisis; Who has cared for the foster youth in the past when parents were unable to; and With whom does the foster youth have a close relationship with? Missouri Revised Statute 210.565.4 Specifies that the age of the foster youth’s relatives, shall not be the only factor taken into consideration in placement decision recommendations to the court about placing the foster youth with a relative. After identifying a potential relative care or kinship care provider, the Children’s Division Worker should ask the family to describe the relationship with that individual/family, to include the following: Provider’s relationship to the foster youth and length of involvement with the family; Description of the provider’s involvement with the family, i.e., provided care for the foster youth and/or parent, assisted the family through crisis, provided moral support, member of church or community organization, neighbor, etc.; and Whether the provider ever resided in the home with the parent or foster youth and, if so, how long and when.

CD employees may adopt a child in the custody of the Division as long as: Custody is transferred to the adoptive parent or another child placing agency when the child is placed in the home; and Someone other than CD provides supervision; or The Regional Director may assign a neighboring county as a measure of last resort should there be no one outside of CD available to provide supervision. When a CD employee is being considered for the adoption of a child in CD custody, and the CD employee is from a different county than the available child’s case manager county, the staffing process may remain the same. CD employees may not adopt a child from their county or circuit of employment unless recruitment for that child has been unsuccessful for a period of 90 days and the recruitment efforts must be documented .   The 90 days will begin when the recruitment efforts have been initiated. Recruitment efforts must be clearly documented. If the employee is from the same county as the available child, the child’s adoption staffing is to take place in a county other than the county where the employee is based, (i.e., neighboring county). In the situations where the child and employee are from the same county, the case manager county is to contact their Regional Office representative to request assistance in assigning the staffing to an alternative county. The alternative county that has been assigned to conduct the staffing is to follow the procedures set forth previously in this manual. In addition to conducting the staffing, the selection committee in the assigned county will ultimately be responsible for making the recommendation of the family that the team selects. The child’s case manager and their supervisor are mandatory members of the selection committee and therefore must be a part of this committee.  They are only to provide information about the child and to answer any questions that may arise.  The child’s case manager and their supervisor will abstain from participating in the recommendation of a family for a child. 4. If a child under the supervision of CD is placed in the physical custody of an  employee, the home study process, case management, and supervision of the case shall be addressed in the order outlined below: a.   The case shall be assigned to a neighboring county or a neighboring office if this occurs in a metro area, for conducting the home study and on-going case management and supervision of the case. b.   The case may be referred through the Foster Care Case Management contract and count in the rotation as a new entry into care. c.   A child/family specific contract may be developed with a child placing agency. Should there be a need to enter into a child/family specific contract with a child placing agency, refer the matter to the Contract Management Unit. 5.   Once the child’s adoption has been finalized, the Regional Office will assign a neighboring county to the employee, in order to provide case management services, related to adoption subsidy, to the employee.  The assigned county will be responsible for requests throughout the duration of the subsidy.

The requirements relating to these investigations (assessments) are found in chapter 453, RSMo. The court will use the assessment to determine if it should allow the adoption. Therefore, it is important that the assessment be completed in a thorough and timely manner. Chapter 453 differentiates between a court requested/ordered adoptive assessment where a child has been placed with the prospective adoptive family pursuant to a court order and one where there was no court order prior to the transfer of custody. The length of time staff has to initiate and complete the assessment depends on whether or not the child was placed pursuant to a court order. In those situations where the child was placed by an appropriate individual/agency, section 453.070, RSMo, mandates that an investigation (assessment) of the adoptive placement be completed and a report submitted to the court within 90 days. The court may direct the Division to complete this investigation. Section 453.110, RSMo, requires the court to order Children’s Division (CD) to conduct an investigation (assessment) and submit a report when a child is placed in the custody of another person/agency before obtaining the court’s authority to do so. This section requires CD to initiate the investigation within 48 hours and submit a report to the court within 30 days. The assessment should include the same information as required in section 453.070, RSMo. However, staff should place greater emphasis on the specifics surrounding the placement of the child. Staff should attempt to locate and interview the birth parents. This information will allow the court to determine if the placement was appropriate and if the birth parents agree to the adoption. Staff may, in the course of their duties, become aware of a child’s placement which is not in compliance with the law. In these situations, staff should immediately notify the court and provide any pertinent and identifying information. Staff should refer to Section 6 Chapter 3 Subsection 8 Sub-subsection 1 to complete the majority of the adoption assessment and the report. However, the following information shall be added when completing an assessment and report as required under chapter 453, RSMo. If the child has not yet been placed in the home, the information about the child’s adjustment in the home can be omitted. Circumstances of the Child’s Placement with the Family: Original reason and circumstances surrounding the child’s placement and when. Was adoption anticipated when the child was placed? Was the plan at the time for the parents to resume custody? What was the child’s health at placement? What was the child’s understanding of the reason for placement? How did the child feel about the placement? Did any money or other considerations change hands at or subsequent to the placement? If so, obtain the particulars. Identifying Information of the Child and Adjustment to the Family Description of the Child: Age, race/ethnicity and birth date; Physical and mental condition. This should be confirmed by a statement from the child’s physician. If the child’s condition suggests that a mental or psychological evaluation would be important, this should be requested from the family and results noted in the report. If the family refuses, the court should be provided with this information; Developmental history; Special needs and potential eligibility for adoption subsidy. Describe the child’s emotional adjustment in the home and his/her desire to remain. Describe how the family has met the physical, mental, intellectual and special needs of the child. Describe the child’s relationship with each member of the family. Interview with the Birth Parents Staff should attempt to make contact with and interview the birth parents, especially when there has been an improper placement. The following information should be obtained: What was the original reason the child was placed with the prospective adoptive family? What is their current intent regarding the child? Are they aware that the prospective adoptive family wants to adopt the child? What are their feelings regarding this adoption? Background history and current status including: Age, race/ethnicity; Employment and educational history; Marital status; General medical and mental health currently and at the time the child was placed; Life history as it specifically relates to the child’s development and decision to place the child for adoption; Current relationship with the child and the prospective adoptive family; Other information which will assist the court in determining the parents’ situation currently and at the time of the placement; Have they signed a consent to adoption or any other documents which pertain to transfer custody? Did they receive any compensation or money for the placement of the child? If so, gather particulars. Interview with the Prospective Adoptive Family Staff should gather the following information relating to the family’s relationship with the child: Why is the family interested in adopting the child; Assess whether or not they can meet the physical, emotional, intellectual and special needs of the child on an ongoing basis; What is their personal relationship with the birth parents and do they anticipate this relationship will change after the adoption?

The worker will develop a treatment plan with the Family Support Team (FST) for stabilizing the child’s behavior, to improve their level of functioning at home, school and in the community and to achieve permanency. Resource parents are the primary change agents for youth placed in their care. Support and guidance should be provided to the resource parents. However, on a case-by-case basis, other therapeutic support may be added for the youth based on the particular situation as recommended by the team working with the youth. During placement home visits the worker will, if needed: Assess and monitor the youth’s progress toward treatment and permanency goals Assess and monitor the resource parent’s job performance Review and discuss reports maintained by the resource parent Arrange regularly scheduled respite care The case manager will assess the level of care required by the youth at 90-day intervals and move the youth to a less restrictive environment as appropriate. The Children’s Service Worker will provide the resource parent with feedback about how the placement and child are doing as needed. Periodic Reviews The goal for youth who qualify for the youth with elevated needs program is to stabilize their behavior, to help them function in a less restrictive environment and to achieve permanency. Level A and Level B care is not permanency but is designed to be a stepping stone for the youth to obtain a permanent home. As these youth do have a variety of special needs, the goal of successful permanency can be challenging. Accordingly, resource parents, staff, and other treatment team members must aggressively pursue permanency and use periodic reviews as one of the tools to assure progress toward permanency is occurring. To assist youth in achieving a permanent home, it is important that the resource parent and the team tailor the level of intensity and intervention to their needs as youth achieve progress and success. Most youth in Level A and Level B care do make substantial improvement in their behavior during the first year of intervention and can function with a reduced level of intensity. Other youth may need the intensity of elevated intervention for longer periods of time to remain out of residential care and/or a more restrictive setting. The dilemma for the teams may be how to move the youth to the appropriate level of intervention, such as Level A or traditional foster care, without moving the youth from the current resource home. Ideally, youth who improve in Level B care and are ready for less intensive care could move directly to their permanent home. When that is not possible, the next best solution is to keep the youth in the same resource home under the category of Level A, traditional foster care (depending on the youth’s needs) or pre-adoptive home. Youth who are happy in their resource home and are experiencing success should not be moved to a different resource home solely due to no longer needing Level B intervention. Staff, resource parents and the team members must assess each individual situation carefully and negotiate an outcome that is in that youth’s best interests. Periodic reviews are a critical tool for assuring the youth’s level of intervention is matching their needs and that permanency is on target. As always, the best interest of the youth is the guiding principal with these complex decisions. Situations where there is disagreement among team members as to continuing need for intervention and/or the appropriate plan for the youth should be referred to the Regional Director or designee for consultation. Periodic Review schedule: Six (6) months – Multi-disciplinary Selection/Screening team that originally recommended placement with the resource parents and/or the Family Support Team. The team will continue to review youth’s situation every 6 months on an on-going basis. Twelve (12) months reviews – Regional Office Review Team conducts a review based on local team review information. Regional Office Reviews are a critical tool in assuring consistency, accountability and progress with the Level B program. Also, Level B Foster Care status does not exclude youth and families from compliance with ASFA timelines.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/mo-section-4-chapter-4-working-children-subsection-5-children-elevated-needs-452-ongoing

Such a youth requires intensive and individualized intervention to succeed in a community-based family setting and to achieve their goal of permanency. Resource providers of youth with elevated needs have received specific training in addition to Specialized Training Assessment Resources and Support (STARS) pre-service training to enable them to work with youth with elevated needs. Placements for youth with elevated needs neither are emergency placements nor are they immediate placements. These placements are transitional placement resources to prepare youth to function adequately in a less restrictive environment and or a permanent home. It is not intended to be a long-term or permanent placement resource . A selection/screening team must evaluate the youth’s needs. A pre-placement phase is essential, meaning that the youth should visit the home prior to being placed to determine if the placement is an appropriate fit for the youth. ICPC resource providers are not eligible for elevated needs placements. The resource licensing worker will notify the elevated needs level B resource parent regarding access to purchase medical, dental, and vision insurance. The worker will inform the resource parent that the insurance company will provide enrollment information. Characteristics of a Youth with Elevated Needs Youth with elevated needs require greater structure, supervision, and are less able to assume responsibility for their daily care. These youth have typically experienced multiple out-of-home placements. Youth appropriate for Level A fall into one of two categories: Youth presently in a residential setting who may be moved to a less intensive setting, but not to a traditional resource home or to their parents’ home; or Youth who lack a viable placement in a traditional resource home and because of their presenting problems would be placed in a residential setting unless an available Level A resource home can be found. Presenting problems displayed by the Level A candidate may include the following: Behaviors which if not modified could result in the youth being designated as a status offender History of irresponsible or inappropriate sexual behavior, which has resulted in the need for extraordinary supervision Threatening, intimidating, or destructive behavior which is demonstrated by multiple incidents over a period of time Problems of defiance when dealing with authority figures Significant problems with peer relations Significant problems at school that affect academic achievement or social adjustment Significant problems with lying, stealing, or manipulating Significant problems of temper control Mild substance abuse related problems Oppositional behavior which contributes to placement disruptions and inability to function productively with peers, parent figures, birth family, etc. Any of above behaviors, coupled with medical problems Any of above behaviors displayed by one or more youth of a sibling group, qualifying the entire sibling group for placement together, if appropriate. However, not all youth would be eligible for the Level A maintenance rate.

Through listening closely to each other, the FST aims to come up with proposals that work for the best interest of the foster youth.

Definitions The federal Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 defines human trafficking in terms of “involuntary servitude”.  Involuntary servitude is a term for someone being forced through some form of coercion to perform acts and/or labor against someone’s will to benefit another.  The most common forms of human trafficking, and the forms of trafficking that will be referred to in policy, are sex trafficking and labor trafficking. Sex Trafficking According to the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, sex trafficking is defined as the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for the purpose of a commercial sex act.  A commercial sex act refers to any sex act of which anything of value is given to or received by any person.  If the trafficked person is younger than age 18, the commercial sexual activity does not need to involve force, fraud, or coercion.  A victim of child sex trafficking is a victim of both abuse and neglect, as referenced in 5.1.2.2.1 of the Child Welfare Manual.  Staff should refer to Section 2, Chapter 5, Subsection 3- The Legal Elements of Child Abuse/Neglect (5.3.8.3.1) of the Child Welfare Manual for more information on the elements of child sex trafficking. Labor Trafficking Labor Trafficking is a “severe form of trafficking in persons” under the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000.  Labor Trafficking occurs when a person uses force, fraud, or coercion to recruit, entice, harbor, transport, provide, or obtain another person for the purpose of providing or receiving involuntary labor or services.  Federal and State definitions do not distinguish between children and adults, so some form of force, fraud, coercion, or deception must be present for children to be defined as victims of labor trafficking.  Staff should refer to Section 2, Chapter 5, Subsection 3- The Legal Elements of Child Abuse/Neglect (5.3.8.3.1) of the Child Welfare Manual for more information on the elements of child labor trafficking. Severe Forms of Trafficking According to the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, “severe forms of trafficking” refers to: Sex trafficking in which a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age; or The recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery. Force, Fraud, Coercion, or Deception Care, custody and control is established by an alleged trafficker pursuant to Section 210.110, RMo. in that they have taken control of the child by deception, force, or coercion.  For more information on the legal definitions of Abuse and Neglect, specifically as it relates to establishing care, custody, and control, staff should refer to Section 2, Chapter 5, Section 1, Subsection 1- Care, Custody, and Control (5.1.1) of the Child Welfare Manual for more information. Conditions that are considered force, fraud, coercion, or deception in trafficking include, but are not limited to, the following: Threatening serious harm to, or physical restraint against, the victim or a third person Destroying, concealing, removing, confiscating, or possessing any passport, immigration document, or other government identification document Abusing or threatening abuse of the law or legal process against the victim or a third person Placing a person in debt bondage Providing a drug, including alcohol, to another person with the intent to impair the person’s judgment or maintain a state of chemical dependence Wrongfully taking, obtaining, or withholding any property of another person Blackmail Asserting control over the finances of another person Withholding or threatening to withhold food or medication Child Sexual Exploitation Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE) is a type of sexual abuse and pursuant to 13 CSR 35-31.010 is defined as: (I) Allowing, permitting, or encouraging a child to engage in prostitution, as defined by state law; or (II) Allowing, permitting, encouraging, or engaging in the obscene or pornographic photographing, filming, or depicting of a child as those acts are defined by state law. This includes the storage or transmission of any data depicting said obscene or pornographic acts, images, or recordings. Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE) can sometimes be viewed as an umbrella term that encompasses many different types of exploitation depending on the act, whether or not there are visual depictions of the child(ren) and/or act, whether or not there is a commercial element and/or an exchange of something of value, and if there is an online component to the act.  Some of the different types of CSE include Child Sex Trafficking (CST), Commercial Sexual Exploitation of the Child (CSEC), Online Sexual Exploitation of Children (OSEC), and Child Sexual Abuse Materials (CSAM).  Oftentimes these differing definitions will overlap with each other. An example of Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE), that would not be defined as Child Sex Trafficking (CST) or Commercial Sexual Exploitation of a Child (CSEC), include instances in which child pornography is found on a personal computer but there is no known exchange of something of value and it is not believed that the visual depictions were shared online.  This example would become an example of CSEC if the visual depictions were shared online with others.  If the visual depictions were of sexual acts with a child, this example would also be a case of CST due to the visual depictions being considered something of value.  The key to differentiating cases of Child Sex Trafficking is the known exchange of something of value. Risk Factors and Indicators of Trafficking Traffickers prey on and target vulnerabilities in their victims in order to make promises aimed at addressing the needs of their victims.  Many times vulnerabilities are learned by the trafficker through the grooming process.  Grooming is when a predator builds a relationship, trust, and emotional connection with a potential victim so they can manipulate and exploit them.  Victims are not only recruited by traffickers, but also by people working for traffickers who are forced to recruit.  A large majority of recruiting occurs online through social media networking apps and sites, but recruiting can also happen in public places. Common Risk Factors for Trafficking in Children/Youth Being in foster care Chronically missing or frequently on the run History of childhood sexual abuse History of physical and emotional abuse Single parent home Minimal supervision Low self-esteem Lacks a strong social network Unsupervised online time Seeks online friendships and connections History of substance use issues or those living with someone with substance use issues History of school truancy Possible Indicators of a Trafficking Victim Frequent runaway episodes Unable to identify where they were while they were on the run Frequent unexplained absences or tardiness from school Inappropriate, sexually suggestive activity on social media, the internet, or cell phone apps Reports meeting someone online A heightened sense of fear or distrust of authority Has material goods that he or she cannot afford: expensive clothing, one or multiple cell phones, nails done, hair extensions, etc.without a clear explanation of how they were obtained Physical injuries with no explanation of how they were received Has suspicious tattoos or other signs of branding Reports multiple sexual partners Associates and/or has relationships with age-inappropriate friends and/or paramours Talks about a paramour, but does not provide their identity Current sexually transmitted infection (STI) or history of STIs Uses drugs and/or alcohol Reports sexual assaults Change of appearance, such as revealing/provocative clothing and weight loss Answers to questions appear to be practiced or rehearsed Avoids answering questions or lets others speak for him/her Appears fearful, anxious, depressed, tense, nervous, paranoid, or hyper vigilant Has multiple cell phones Has hotel keys or talks about staying in hotels Involved in gang activity Trauma Informed Approach to Discussing Human Trafficking Safety : Ensure physical and emotional safety, recognizing and responding to how racial, ethnic, religious, gender or sexual identity may impact safety across the lifespan. Conduct the conversation where the youth feels safe from intrusions or others hearing the conversation.  If the youth requests someone else join the conversation and if you feel it is safe, allow that to happen; however you may need to consider if this person is part of the trafficking and would have undue influence on the youth’s statements. Also think about emotional safety, in particular that you are not judging them in any way and will keep this information confidential as outlined in policy (to report to CAC, supervisor, hotline or law enforcement).  Consider their familial and personal history and culture as well as their identity.  Remember to some this was a way to survive on the streets.  Recognize the fears they may have about the future, repercussions and judgment.  Assure them that they were the victim and are not in trouble as the trafficker may have told them of consequences if they left or told anyone what has happened. Trustworthiness : Foster genuine relationships and practices that build trust, making tasks clear, maintaining appropriate boundaries and creating norms for interaction that promote reconciliation and healing. Understand and respond to ways in which explicit and implicit power can affect the development of trusting relationships. This includes acknowledging and mitigating internal biases and recognizing the historic power of majority populations. The person who conducts the interview should be someone that the youth knows and trusts.  If there is no prior relationship you will need to spend time building a level of trust prior to delving into these intimate discussions.  Make them as comfortable as you can and reduce any requirements or mandates that they would see as the use of power or authority against them.  Share as much information as you can about the purpose of the conversation and what will be done with the information so they feel informed.  Remember that people may have used their power, authority, access to resources and even charm on the youth to engage them in trafficking. Their trust in other adults who are in positions of authority may be very limited.  Recognize your own biases on issues that the youth may be facing such as sexual identity and/or orientation, choices they have made, options and alternatives they face.  The youth may have felt they had limited options and made choices just to survive even if you felt they had other options.  Remember that if the youth was trafficked, others may have made them many promises and initially presented as someone they could trust and then used that trust against them. Choice : Maximize choice, addressing how privilege, power, and historic relationships impact both perceptions about and ability to act upon choice. Provide as much choice as you can in regards to the location and timing of the conversation.  Reduce any implicit or explicit acts of using power or authority and allow them as much control as you can.  They may have experienced others appearing to give them choice or options but who actually backed them into a corner leading to engagement in trafficking.  They may not believe you are providing them with real choices.  They too may have felt they had no choice in their ability to survive which led them to be trafficked.  Don’t judge their choices. Collaboration : Honor transparency and self-determination, and seek to minimize the impact of the inherent power differential while maximizing collaboration and sharing responsibility for making meaningful decisions. Share decision making with the youth, in not only the conversation but in next steps or what they may need.  Don’t be ashamed to admit your lack of experience in such issues as surviving on the street, homelessness etc.  Let them share their experiences with you and validate their emotional response, fears and choices.  Don’t take control as that is what the trafficker may have done. Empowerment : Encouraging self-efficacy, identifying strengths and building skills which lead to individual pathways for healing while recognizing and responding to the impact of historical trauma and oppression. Let the youth lead you through the conversation and listen.  They may not answer your questions directly but if you let them talk and you actively listen, you can get the information you need.  As with collaboration, empower them to make decisions about next steps.  They need to feel that they can take back control of their bod and life without fear of judgment or repercussions. Response Protocol Staff must complete the CD-288 Human Trafficking Assessment Tool in the following instances to determine whether a child/youth may be a victim of, or is at risk of being a victim of, human trafficking: Within 24 hours for a victim(s) and non-victim(s) listed on a CA/N report with allegations of human trafficking Within 24 hours of a child/youth in state custody returning from being on the run, missing, or abducted Within 24 hours for any child/youth that is involved with Children’s Division through a CA/N report, FCS case, or AC case in which there is suspicion of human trafficking, history of human trafficking, and/or new concerns of human trafficking Within 72 hours for children/youth that are involved with Children’s Division through a CA/N report, FCS case, or AC case in which it is learned that there is a known history of running away from home/placement When a child’s circumstances change or new information is learned about the child/youth which warrants the usage of a more comprehensive screening of human trafficking Immediately when imminent safety concerns are present in which there are immediate concerns for a child/youth being trafficked The CD-288 Human Trafficking Assessment Tool encompasses two parts, the Indicators Section and the Comprehensive Assessment Section.  If the child/youth has already disclosed being a victim of human trafficking, this tool does not need to be completed.  Instead, a CAC forensic interview should be scheduled to occur as soon as reasonably possible. The Indicators Section (Part 1) of the Human Trafficking Assessment Tool is to be used to evaluate the potential risk and victimization of child/youth human trafficking.  The indicators listed in Part 1 help to determine whether a child/youth may be a victim of human trafficking, or is at risk of being a victim of human trafficking.  When any one or more indicator is recorded in Part 1, the Comprehensive Assessment Section (Part 2) of the tool must be completed. Part 2 of the CD-288 Human Trafficking Assessment Tool is a more comprehensive assessment of risk and victimization of human trafficking and should be completed with the child/youth in a conversational manner.  Screeners should ensure that the comprehensive screening is completed in a safe and non-threatening environment to promote the establishment of rapport and trust with the child/youth.  Do not interview a child/youth in front of a suspected trafficker or individual who is exhibiting controlling behavior over the child/youth. It is likely that a child/youth may be reluctant to respond to the questions in the comprehensive assessment section due to fear, lack of trust, fear of consequences related to disclosure, and/or not viewing themselves as a victim.  Therefore, a non-judgmental and trauma informed approach must be utilized to engage the child/youth in a conversation rather than reading the questions in the tool verbatim.  If at any time the child/youth is clearly not ready to engage in the conversation brought forth through the use of the comprehensive screening, it is appropriate to end the screening and re-attempt the completion of the screening within no later than five (5) business days. Some questions in the Comprehensive Assessment Section the CD-288 Human Trafficking Assessment Tool are not appropriate or applicable for a child twelve (12) years and younger. Staff must use their best judgment to determine which questions are appropriate or applicable for a child twelve (12) years and younger based on their developmental age. Staff must document the results of the CD-288 Human Trafficking Assessment Tool in the narrative portion of FACES upon completion.  If it is determined that a child/youth “likely is” a victim of human trafficking, staff must: Call the National Human Trafficking Hotline at (888) 373-7888 Call in a new report to CANHU if human trafficking is not a current allegation in an open investigation Notify local law enforcement for a co-investigation Proceed with scheduling a CAC forensic interview within 24 hours, to occur as soon as reasonably possible. Staff should refer to Section 4, Chapter 4 (Working with Children), Subsection 9 – Missing Person Report Procedure of the Child Welfare Manual for more information regarding procedures and responses to runaway youth and possible indicators of human trafficking.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/mo-section-4-chapter-4-working-children-subsection-4-special-populations-446-human-trafficking

"MO :: Section 4, Chapter 4 (Working with Children), Subsection 4 – Special Populations :: 4.4.5 U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Issues",Missouri,Rules,"2023, 2022, 2021","Administrative process, Definitions, Entry to care, Legal process, Permanency, Placement, Reporting requirements",,,"In the course of conducting investigations/family assessment; providing family-centered services; or providing Family-Centered Out-of-Home Care, Children’s Division staff may encounter families with various citizenship/immigration issues. This subsection presents policy and procedure for addressing citizenship/immigration issues for children entering out-of-home care: Verification of the Child’s Identity and Citizenship/Immigration Status When a child is taken into protective custody, the worker must make every effort to verify citizenship/immigration status with the information available.  Procedure for verifying citizenship/immigration status can be found in the related subject box below as it relates to Section 6036 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 section 1903 of the Social Security Act for new applicants and recipients for all categories of Medicaid. Worker shall determine the child’s citizenship/immigration status which includes: U.S. Citizens (Either born a citizen or naturalized) Foreign Nationals Foreign Nationals with Immigrant Visas (such as lawful permanent residents (LPR) – Green Card) Foreign Nations with Non-Immigrant Visa’s (In the U.S. for a temporary stay) Undocumented Immigrants (Illegal Aliens) Dual Citizenship (an individual is recognized as a U.S. Citizen as well as a Citizen of another country) Verifying Citizenship/Immigrant Status for Adult Clients It may also be necessary for the worker to verify the citizenship/immigration status of adults related to the case for the purpose of: Establishing the child’s citizenship/immigration status based on the parents status; Determining citizenship/immigration status of parents or other relatives, and if appropriate, providing them resource information to pursue change of status; Determining the appropriateness of relative placement options based on status; and/or Using U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services or U.S. Consulate resources to assist in diligent searches for parents or other relatives. The worker must make clear, legible copies of all documents verifying the immigration status of a child for the file. The worker should make certain copies of any immigration documentation, including passports and visas are kept in a secure location while a child is in care so they may be produced when necessary. The actual immigration documents (including passports and visas) may be property of the United States Government or the foreign country that issued the document and may have to be surrendered to the issuing country under some circumstances. The Notification of Foreign Consulates/Embassies when a Child is Believed to Be a Foreign National In most cases the Children’s Division is required to notify the consulate/embassy of another country without unreasonable delay when a child or youth who is a foreign national is arrested; detained; or when a minor who is a foreign national, is placed in custody of the Division where the United States and the individual’s country of origin are signatories to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.  (Article 37 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations) For purposes of consular notification a “foreign national” is any person who is not born a U.S. citizen or has not been naturalized as a U.S. citizen. When a child comes into the legal custody of the Children’s Division the worker will make reasonable efforts to verify the child’s citizenship or immigration status. If the worker verifies the child is or may be a foreign national through documentation or has received information which leads the worker to believe the child is a foreign national, the worker will complete a Consular Notification to Central Office (CD-146) and send it to Central Office. If the worker verifies the child is a U.S. citizen consular notification may not be required.  However, if the worker verifies, through written documentation the child is both a U.S. citizen and a citizen from another county, a CD-146 should be completed and sent to Central Office via email. The CD-146 will be reviewed by Central Office, based on information provided by the field, to determine if notification to the country of origin is required.  If appropriate, central office will notify the consulate by letter and send a copy to the worker to place in the Child Section of the case file.  Central Office should consult with DLS for legal advice if necessary. There may be some circumstances in which it will be necessary for Central Office to consult with the United States Department of State or the Division of Legal Services before the foreign Consulate/Embassy is notified. Working with a Consulate/Embassy If Central Office makes the decision to notify the consulate of the country of origin, it will be the responsibility of the worker to cooperate with requests by the applicable Consulate to interview, visit and otherwise communicate with children in custody of the division who are nationals of their respective country.  However, it is important to note the fact the law may require notification to a consulate does not mean that the consulate is entitled to full access to confidential information pertaining to the child. DLS should be consulted for legal advice to determine what information CD may lawfully share with the Consulate/Embassy and whether an interview may take place. Before the visit or interview is arranged, the worker will contact the child’s court-appointed attorney or guardian ad litem regarding the requests.  Visits and access by the applicable Consulate and should be consistent with the best interests of the child, or as ordered by the Court. Central Office, if needed by the worker, may request from the Consulate: Assistance with obtaining official copies of birth certificates that are certified for authenticity; Names of appropriate agencies within the country that can assist in Identifying relatives or other placement options; and/or Conducting necessary background checks and home studies. Family Support Team (FST) – Permanency Plans for Undocumented Child(ren) The Family Support Team must address citizenship/immigration issues during the treatment planning and permanency goal process for children who are undocumented immigrants.  The Children’s Service Worker, the family, and other members of the family support team must evaluate and make recommendations on whether it is appropriate to assist the individual in seeking permanent residency, United States citizenship, or repatriation to the child’s country of origin. This decision must ultimately be made with the child’s best interests in mind based on the following considerations: Date of entry into the U.S. (the length of time in country and date of entry impact eligibility for benefits); Immigration status (impacts eligibility for legal residency); Cultural factors (such as language barriers; length of time in, and familiarity with this country; and degree of acculturation); Availability and quality of care in the U.S. versus the country of origin; Resources available to the individual (such as relatives willing and capable of providing assistance; government benefits; or community resources); The child’s wishes; The wishes of the child’s parent(s), legal guardian(s) and or other relevant family members; and The position of the child’s country of origin and the United States Government. The Family Support Team will recommend the most appropriate treatment plan and permanency goal for the child. The final decision on whether the Children’s Division will take action in an immigration matter and what actions may be appropriate will be made by CD Central Office, not the local office or the Family Support Team. If the goal requires an adjustment of citizenship or immigration status, the Division of Legal Services may assist the worker to assure the proper paperwork is filed and proper action steps are completed. Action steps may include: Completion of immigration forms; Locating a civil surgeon to complete a physical exam; Collecting vital records from other states or countries; and/or Locating a fingerprinting site authorized by USCIS. If a child in out-of-home care is an undocumented immigrant minor, repatriation to the child’s country of origin may serve as a compelling reason not to file termination of parental rights.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/mo-section-4-chapter-4-working-children-subsection-4-special-populations-445-us-citizenship

The referral includes all information known about the child. Determine whether the juvenile court will take jurisdiction of the child and whether an appropriate alternate care facility (foster, relative, or kinship family) only is potentially available for the child. NOTE: No service can be provided if both of the above conditions are not met. Report determination to RPC with the following information: Date of placement or decision rejecting placement for the minor. Date of jurisdiction hearing. Name and address of placement. Plan for service delivery. These children are not eligible for adoption services. Complete family assessment and submit two (2) copies to RPC. NOTE: These families are to be licensed only for care of the specific unaccompanied minor. Deliver needed services. Comply with all ICPC requirements. NOTE:  Close adherence to ICPC requirements is vital as federal regulations require proof in order for the state to have program costs reimbursed. Arrange for meeting cost of care using applicable funds: Contact RPC for unusual circumstances. Every six (6) months after placement, report progress to RPC (four (4) copies are needed) and to juvenile court having jurisdiction. Terminate services if any of the following should occur: Child leaves the state. Child reaches majority age. Child is reunited with an adult relative and further services are not needed or the family is not geographically available. Report status immediately to RPC using form ORR-2. Record all services every 30 days. Program Requirements and Procedures: Eligibility: Cuban/Haitian Entrant Unaccompanied Minors: Has not attained age 17; Entered the United States without a parent or immediate adult relative (i.e., grandparent, aunt, uncle or adult sibling), or any adult who arrived having documentable evidence of custody of the minor; Has no parents in the United States; and Has been given the alien status of “Cuban/Haitian Entrant” by the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization (INS). Refugee Unaccompanied Minors: Has not attained the age of 18; Has no known immediate adult kin in the United States; Has been lawfully admitted to the United States in parole status; and Meets the general definition of alien status of INS. Family assessment concerns specific to Unaccompanied Minor and Cuban/Haitian Entrant Placement Services: How will the family handle the language barrier and what resources are available to assist in teaching English to the child. What are the family’s attitudes toward racial and ethnic differences (including food preferences). What resources within the family and community are available to assist with the possible severe physical and emotional problems of the child (i.e., strange and unknown diseases). What are the local community’s attitudes toward racial, ethnic and religious differences and how will the family deal with community rejection if it occurs. What community resources exist for appropriate education and job training, if applicable. What Asian or Cuban/Haitian family support groups exist or could be developed in the community. What is the family’s attitude toward the national priority and effort to reunite refugee children with the natural family when possible. Services: Provision of legal responsibility. Development and execution of a written service plan. Meeting the cost of care. Provision of a periodic case review (otherwise known as administrative review). Provision of progress reports to the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) through the refugee program coordinator (RPC) in central office regarding the child’s status and services delivered. Provision of financial assistance, medical care and support services. Vocational and occupational training. Cultural orientation, as necessary and appropriate. English as a second language. NOTE: Items 7, 8, and 9 must be authorized by ORR in order for the state to receive financial reimbursement. Meeting the cost of alternate care and other services: The federal government will reimburse the state for 100 percent of the costs associated with providing services to children under this program, including foster care maintenance payments, medical assistance, social services, and for administrative costs associated with these activities. This reimbursement under the Refugee Assistance Program (RAP) is separate and distinct from the state’s normal allocation of federal funds. For Cuban/Haitian Entrants in this program reimbursement can be provided on behalf of an unaccompanied minor until one (1) month after the minor attains 21 years of age, or if the court terminates jurisdiction at an earlier time, one (1) month past the date the court terminates jurisdiction. Special Requirements: Since all child placements through this program are received by the ICPC coordinator, the following groups define the sending state: Cuban/Haitian Entrants – U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR). Refugee Unaccompanied Minors – private, voluntary resettlement agencies serving in the U.S. and foreign countries. Out-of-State Unaccompanied Minors: If a minor is in CD custody and becomes a runaway, contact RPC immediately. The RPC will work with the ICPC Coordinator in making appropriate arrangements for the child to remain in the other state or be returned to Missouri. If a minor is not in CD custody and becomes a runaway, contact the RPC immediately. The RPC will work with the ICPC coordinator and Division of Youth Services (DYS) which administers the Interstate Compact on Juveniles (ICJ) in making the appropriate arrangements for the minor to remain in the other state or be returned to Missouri. Runaway minors will remain the responsibility of the sending state unless an alternate placement and legal custody is established in the receiving state. Compact procedures must be utilized in dealing with runaway minors. Missouri is the sending state since a Missouri court will have assumed jurisdiction in order for the child to have been placed in alternate care. Relative Placements: For minors already in Missouri and placed with non-parental adult relative, the relative may initiate legal proceedings or ask CD to do so in their behalf. If the adult relative with whom the minor is placed cannot present a court order granting them custody within a 60-day period after placement, CD will assist in completing the proceedings in their behalf. Cuban/Haitian Children Not Placed Through ORR: If a minor arrives in Missouri but has not been placed here by ORR through established procedures and has no legally responsible relative, report immediately to the RPC by telephone and confirming IOC. Emergency services may be provided, however, permanent service commitments must be approved by the RPC. The minor would be eligible for the same services as the minor who is placed through established procedures by ORR.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/mo-section-4-chapter-4-working-children-subsection-4-special-populations-444-procedures

The juvenile office should take the responsibility for this determination. However, if the juvenile office does not assume this responsibility and the child and the family is receiving services from the Division, the worker should assume this responsibility. The following guidelines will help in the important step of determining a child’s Indian status: Do you, your parents or your grandparents have any Indian blood? If so, do you know what tribe they may be related to? Do you know which state your Indian kin lived in? Has anyone provided information that the child’s or family’s usual residence is on a reservation or in a predominantly Indian community? Has a tribe or the Bureau of Indian Affairs indicated the child is a member or eligible for membership in a tribe? Has anyone provided information that any child member of the family is under the jurisdiction of a tribal court? An Indian child’s status can be confirmed through any or all of the following activities: Securing information from extended family members, when possible, that expands information given by child or parent; Examining and copying, with permission, any documents the parent or child may have that provide proof of Indian status; Correspondence with Bureau of Indian Affairs, identified tribe, Indian Service Agency, etc., which includes all identifying information of a child and his parents, possible tribal relationship and any other pertinent information. If a tribe is known, the address can be obtained from the Bureau of Indian Affairs area office. Also, an Indian center agency may have addresses for an Indian tribe. Out-of-Home Care Placement Mandates Foster Care and Pre-Adoptive Placement: Criteria –  This criteria is used when placing an Indian child in any type of out-of-home care: Least restrictive setting which approximates a family and is appropriate to child’s needs, and Is within reasonable proximity to child’s home while accommodating the child’s needs. Preference order: A member of the Indian child’s family which includes extended family. A foster home licensed, approved or specified by the Indian child’s tribe or their designee which may be the nearest Indian social services program. An Indian foster home licensed or approved by a non-Indian licensing authority. An institution for children approved by the Indian tribe or operated by an Indian organization which has a program suitable to meet the child’s needs. NOTE: Prior to considering an institution, a non-Indian licensed foster family may be deemed as suitable for the child’s care, if appropriate, in meeting the child’s needs (i.e., traditional foster family, youth with elevated needs foster family, etc.) This may be changed for “good cause” by the tribal court or the juvenile court. Adoptive Placement Preference Order: A member of the child’s extended family unless the parent has requested anonymity be retained in any current or future placement. Another member of the Indian child’s tribe. Other Indian families. This order may be changed for “good cause” by the tribal court or the juvenile court. Voluntarily releasing a child for adoption is as follows: A birth parent registered on an Indian Tribal Role does have the right to place the child outside the preference order stipulated in the Act. However, certain procedures prescribed in the Act must be followed to the letter. These are: The biological parent cannot sign voluntary relinquishments until the infant is at least ten (10) days old. The relinquishment must be signed in a court proceeding. Having the forms witnessed by a judge outside of a formal proceeding is not satisfactory in meeting the requirements of the Act. The relinquishing parent must sign an affidavit that he/she is aware of the Act and such affidavit must be made part of and recorded in the court’s official record. A certified copy of the court record must be sent to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Assisting the prospective adoptive family in such a placement plan: They should be informed about the legal requirements, particularly the application of the procedures even though the birth parent is choosing to go outside the preference order of the Act. They should be informed that the birth parent can revoke the voluntary relinquishment of paternal rights any time up to finalization of the adoption and that if the procedures are not followed and the adoption is granted it is not valid and is subject to the parent demanding the child be returned at any time. Worker’s role with the court: The worker must follow the above requirements as they apply and facilitate the court’s legal proceeding. Question should be raised with the juvenile court to obtain adequate instruction when handling a voluntary relinquishment and participating in the subsequent court proceedings if procedures are not clear.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/mo-section-4-chapter-4-working-children-subsection-4-special-populations-443-determining

Determine child’s Indian status, if juvenile office does not, through use of resources and guidelines identified in this chapter. NOTE:  This is a critical step so that services and rights awarded to Indian children via the ICWA can be provided. Indian heritage and membership is frequently not apparent, so the child and the family should be engaged in careful questioning and discussion about the possibility of tribal membership through ancestral heritage. Coordinate services with nearest available Indian social services ICWA program. There are two (2) in Missouri, as noted above. If Indian centers are unable to provide services and child is clearly of Indian heritage, provide child welfare services with respect for Indian heritage and cultural beliefs and use of the ICWA requirements. Assist foster family or other care facility to provide services recognizing child’s Indian heritage and cultural beliefs. Apply any ICWA requirements when providing services with the assistance of ICWA specialist, if available. Notify juvenile court of Indian status information in writing. A request must be made to the court for permission to release confidential information including copies of court orders if Indian tribal membership is established. NOTE: As a Title II grantee, Indian centers are under obligation to protect confidential information about the child and his/her family. When the juvenile court transfers jurisdiction of a child to the tribal court, cooperate with the tribal court by providing information, services and recommendations. NOTE: Tribal courts have parity with juvenile/state courts when they have assumed jurisdiction of a child. Apply legally mandated placement selection guidelines if placement is ordered by tribal or juvenile court: Use Indian centers to determine if an Indian foster family or other Indian care facilities are available, as needed. Use FACES search to identify foster families accepting Indian children or other care facilities, if Indian centers are unable to provide out-of-home care services. See later in this section for processing a voluntary relinquishment for adoption by an Indian parent. Apply appropriate procedures in delivering out-of-home care services. This includes, but is not limited to: Providing information to appropriate Indian center staff: CA/N complaint (with reporter’s name deleted) and social history of child and family including any forms on which such data is recorded; Medical history including any forms on which such data is recorded; Psychiatric, psychological, etc., evaluation reports; and/or School reports, etc. Including representative of Indian center in notification of FST meetings and court hearings. Respond promptly to any orders of the juvenile court as it complies with the requirements of the ACT. Record all activities every 30 days using guidelines for type of service activity.

"MO :: Section 4, Chapter 4 (Working with Children), Subsection 4 – Special Populations :: 4.4.1 Indian Child Welfare Procedure and Process",Missouri,Rules,"2023, 2022, 2021","Definitions, Legal process, Placement, Reporting requirements",,,"The Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) of 1978, P.L. 95-608, is a federal law which regulates placement proceedings involving Indian children. It mandates preventive services before removal to protect the best interest of Indian children and to promote the stability and security of Indian families and tribes. The Children’s Division complies with all mandates of the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, which includes preventing the unnecessary and arbitrary removal of Indian children from their families and tribes; placing an Indian child who must be removed in an available and safe home that reflects the unique values of American Indian culture; and adheres to the placement requirements of the Indian Child Welfare Act. Procedure In any child protection or involuntary foster care proceeding or termination of parental rights, guardianship, pre-adoptive or adoptive proceeding in a state court where Children’s Division knows or has reason to know an Indian child is involved, the Children’s Service Worker will make reasonable efforts to determine the identity and location of the child’s Indian parents, custodian and/or tribe. Once there is an indication or suspicion that a child is American Indian/Alaskan Native, the case is to be handled as an ICWA case until ALL the Tribes notified respond that the child is neither a tribal member nor eligible for tribal membership. Be sure that the Tribe provides this ruling in writing, on Tribal letterhead, to the Children’s Division office for the child’s file. If the case is not likely to be ICWA, handle as a non-ICWA case. Once American Indian/Alaskan Native heritage has been identified, the Children’s Division shall notify the identified tribe(s) and request assistance to provide the child and family with services. Under the laws of ICWA, child custody proceedings and foster care placements do not include a placement based on an act which, if committed by an adult, would be deemed a crime. ICWA is applicable to all termination of parental rights (TPR) proceedings whether those proceedings occur from a child protection or delinquency case or action. ICWA is not applicable to child custody proceedings between the child’s parents or other caregivers. Children’s Division may seek assistance from the Secretary of the Interior or his/her designees for information on the identity and location of the child’s Indian parents, custodians and/or tribe. The office to be contacted for the Missouri region is: Eastern Regional Office Bureau of Indian Affairs 545 Marriott Drive, Suite 700 Nashville, TN 37214 Telephone: (615) 564-6500 Fax: (615) 564-6701 Children’s Division shall ensure that notification is provided to the Indian parents, custodian and/or tribe by certified mail with a return receipt requested, of the pending proceedings and of their right of intervention, either through direct notification or by providing information for the notification to the juvenile court. Children’s Division recognizes the child’s Indian tribe has an interest, separate from a parent’s interest, in any proceeding involving the child and that interest must be protected throughout the child custody proceeding. The child’s Indian tribe has the right to intervene at any point in the proceedings and absent good cause to the contrary, may receive a transfer of jurisdiction of the case to the appropriate tribal court. Every effort shall be made by the Children’s Division to ensure when Indian children must be placed into alternative care that the placement reflects the true values of the child’s Indian culture. Special preference is to be made to place the child with (in order of ICWA placement priority): A member of the child’s extended family; A foster home licensed, approved, or specified by the Indian child’s tribe. An Indian foster home licensed or approved by an authorized non-Indian licensing or certifying authority; Other members of the Indian child’s tribe; Other Indian families; A non-Indian foster family may be used when an Indian family resource is not available and after diligent efforts have been made to locate an Indian family. Voluntary consents for foster care or relinquishments must be made in writing and recorded before a court of competent jurisdiction and certified by the judge or the court. The worker must use active efforts to work towards preventing the placement of the child as well as towards reunification for the family. “ Active Efforts ” are energetic efforts that show an active attempt to assist in alleviating the problems or issues that led to removal of the child from the family. Active efforts must also take into consideration the family’s cultural norms and the tribe’s resources. Requirements for a worker’s efforts to reunite an Indian/Native Alaskan family are greater than those for non-Indian families. Children’s Division shall be prepared for the court to review the Children’s Division actions to ensure: American Indian/Alaskan Native heritage was determined. The tribe was notified of its right to intervene. That a “qualified expert” determined that the child was likely to suffer emotional or physical harm if left at home and will testify to this in court. The Tribe is the best source for identifying qualified experts, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs may also assist as needed. Children’s Division has made active efforts to prevent placement. Children’s Division considered and preference was given to place the child with extended family members, an approved tribal home, Indian foster home, or an Indian-approved institution as noted above. An expert witness in Indian matters for child custody proceedings is qualified if either of the following criteria is met: A member of the child’s tribe who is recognized by the tribal community as knowledgeable in tribal customs as they pertain to family organization and child rearing practices. A lay or professional expert witness having substantial experience in the delivery of child and family services to Indians, and extensive knowledge of prevailing social and cultural standards and child rearing practices within the Indian child’s tribe. A qualified expert witness is not an expert on the ICWA, but an expert on the child’s tribe. There are two Indian Centers in the state that may assist the worker in regards to services for Native American families, or for possible referral to a qualified expert witness: Kansas City Indian Center 600 West 39th Street Kansas City, MO 64111 Phone: 816-421-7608 Fax: 816-421-6493 www.kcindiancenter.org Southwest Missouri Indian Center 543 Scenic Ave Springfield, MO  65802 (417) 869-9550 Process During initial contact with the parent or custodian of the child, the Children’s Service Worker shall ask if the child has any Native American Indian or Alaskan Native heritage.  The family will complete the Indian Ancestry Questionnaire , CD-116 , and return to the worker.  This is to document that the child does or does not have Indian/Alaskan Native heritage. The worker shall complete the ICWA Checklist, CD-123 , during the intake of any child to ensure ICWA compliance throughout the life of the case. Phone contact to the appropriate ICWA representative of the tribe, if known, shall be made within 48 hours of the child being taken into protective custody and the worker learning of the child’s Indian heritage. The appropriate written notification should follow, either directly by the worker or by providing information to the juvenile court to make such notification. Written notification shall be made by certified mail with a return receipt requested. Notice shall be made by certified mail, concurrently with verbal notice, and no later than 48 hours to: The Tribe (if known); Parents or Indian custodian; and Appropriate Bureau of Indian Affairs office Children’s Division should expect the ICWA director of the appropriate tribe to complete a referral to the appropriate tribal council for possible intervention or request to transfer jurisdiction to tribal court and the appropriate tribal social services office. Actual transfer of the child may occur upon determination that jurisdiction will transfer and receipt of the tribal court order covering jurisdiction of the child. Definitions Specific to ICWA Child Custody Proceeding: Any action removing an American Indian/Alaskan Native from his/her parent or Indian custodian for temporary placement in a foster home or institution where the parent or custodian cannot have the child returned upon demand, but where parental rights have not been terminated. Termination of Parental Rights (TPR): Any action resulting in the legal termination of a parent-child relationship. No termination of parental rights can be ordered unless it is supported by evidence that is beyond a reasonable doubt . This is a higher standard that required by Missouri law. Indian: Any person who is a member of an Indian tribe, or who is an Alaskan Native and a member of the Regional Corporation as defined in Section 7 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. This definition of an Indian voids any previous definition used prior to the ICWA settlement. Indian Child: Any unmarried person under the age of 18 who is either a member of an Indian tribe or is eligible for membership in an Indian tribe and/or is the biological child of a member of an Indian tribe. At the age of 18, upon application, the Indian child who was the subject of an adoption shall be informed by the presiding court of the child’s tribal affiliation, if any. The child shall be given information regarding his/her biological parents, and any other information necessary to protect any rights allowed by the individual’s tribal membership. Indian Child’s Tribe: The Indian tribe in which the child is a member or is eligible for membership. The tribal membership will be designated to that with which the child has the more significant contacts when the child’s membership or eligibility for membership is with more than one tribe. Indian Custodian: Any Indian person who has legal custody of an Indian child under tribal law or custom or under state law or to whom temporary physical care, custody and control has been transferred by the parent of such child. Indian Extended Family Member: Is defined by the law or custom of the Indian child’s tribe or, in the absence of such law or custom, to be a person who has reached the age of 18 and who is the Indian child’s grandparent, aunt or uncle, brother or sister, brother-in-law or sister-in-law, niece or nephew, first or second cousin, or a step-parent. Indian Organization: Any group, association, partnership, corporation, or other legal entity owned or controlled by Indians, or a majority of whose members are Indians. Indian Parent: Any biological parent or parents of an Indian child or any Indian person who has lawfully adopted an Indian child, including adoption under tribal law or custom. This definition does not include the unwed father where paternity has not been acknowledged or established. Federal statute states that a putative father of a child who is voluntarily relinquished by the mother must acknowledge paternity or his paternity must be established if his rights are to be respected in the custody proceedings. Since changes in case law since 1978 regarding putative father rights may effect this ICWA requirement, the Children’s Service Worker may contact the Division of Legal Services for further information. Indian Tribal Court: A court with jurisdiction over child custody proceedings which is either a court of Indian offenses, a court established and operated under the code or custom of an Indian tribe, or any other administrative body of a tribe which is vested with authority over child custody proceedings. Indian Tribe: Any Indian tribe, band, nation or other group or community of Indians recognized as eligible for services provided to Indians by the Secretary of the Interior because of their status as Indians, including an Alaskan Native village.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/mo-section-4-chapter-4-working-children-subsection-4-special-populations-441-indian-child

The process described in this subsection deals with issues regarding case management decisions. Licensing issues are addressed in Section 6, Chapter 7.1 Children’s Division’s Fair Hearing Process. The Alternative Care Review Board (ACRB) is to be used when the alternative care (foster/relative adoptive or foster/adoptive care) parent disagrees with any decision made by Children’s Division (CD) regarding a case management issue involving an individual alternative care child who is, or has been, in the claimant’s physical custody. The Children’s Division (CD) recognizes alternative care parents as colleagues and professional members of the Family Support Team (FST) for children placed in their care. As such, they shall be invited and encouraged to actively participate in case plan development and implementation, FST Meetings, and any other staffings/meetings held to evaluate future placement needs/plans for the child(ren) in their care.

The foster home shall be placed on Administrative Hold until the complete grievance process has reached its conclusion with the final decision of the Division Director, and the 90 day time frame the applicant/provider has to file an appeal in their circuit court has expired RSMo 208.100. Administrative Hold is considered a non-punitive action and is not open for appeal in the fair hearing process. No close reason of revocation or denial shall be entered in FACES until after: The 30 day time frame for the provider to request a Fair Hearing has passed. The final Director decision after the Fair Hearing is received. The 90 day time frame following the final Director decision that the applicant/provider has to file an appeal in their circuit court. To deny a license renewal is to act upon a license already in existence, and is considered a revocation. The Fair Hearing Process involves the following steps: The worker will complete the Resource Home Adverse Action Report, CS-20. This form provides a standardized format for transmitting recommendations regarding negative licensing action for administrative approval. After obtaining all the required administrative approval on the CS-20, the worker will send the foster/relative/adoptive or foster/adoptive care applicant/resource provider the Notification of Resource Adverse Action, CS-20a,using certified mail through the United States Postal Services. The instructions for the CS20-a are located on CD desk top forms. The Application for Fair Hearing, CD-53, and Withdrawal of Request for Fair Hearing, CD-54, will be included in the same mailing as the CS-20a. A written request for a Fair Hearing, CD-53, must be received by the Children’s Service Worker, within thirty (30) calendar days of the date the provider/applicant received or refused the written Notification of Resource Home Adverse Action, CS-20a. Obtain immediate supervisor’s signature on Application for Fair Hearing, CD-53, indicating agreement with agency position. Once the Children’s Service Worker has received a written request from the applicant/resource provider requesting a Fair Hearing, the Children’s Service Worker shall complete the following: Advise the Regional Director/Designee of this request; Forward the CD-53 to the Division of Legal Services, DLS, Hearings Unit within one (1) working day after the date of the hearing request was received; and If legal representation is required by the Division, a Case Referral Form for legal representation shall be sent to the DLS, Litigation Unit. Schedule the informal meeting within ten (10) working days of receiving the CD-53. The worker must submit a Hearing Packet that includes a copy of the DLS Case Referral Form , the Notification of Resource Home Adverse Action, CS-20a, advising applicant/resource provider of adverse action, and three copies of the Application for Fair Hearing, CD-53, to the DLS Hearings Unit, within one (1) working day after the date of the hearing request. Allow the applicant/resource provider (or his/her legal counsel or designee) access to foster/adoptive/relative home or foster/adoptive care case record, with the Children’s Service Worker/Supervisor present. The Children’s Service Worker shall provide one copy of case record materials that directly relate to licensing/approval status upon request to the applicant/resource provider (or his/her legal counsel or designee). Upon receiving a request for a hearing, the worker will attempt to resolve the issues informally with the applicant/resource provider while concurrently preparing for the Fair Hearing. This Informal meeting is scheduled to take place within ten (10) working days of the worker receiving the CD-53 from the applicant/resource provider. Participants in the meeting should include the applicant/resource provider, the worker, the worker’s supervisor, Circuit Manager/Designee, and appropriate Regional Director/Designee. The purpose of this meeting is to review information provided by the applicant/resource provider and Division staff to see if the issue can be resolved prior to the Fair Hearing. If the issue is resolved as a result of this informal meeting a written request using the Withdrawal of Request for Fair Hearing, CD-54 must be submitted for the Fair Hearing process to cease. The CD-54, will be completed when the applicant/resource provider or Children’s Division requests a Fair Hearing withdrawal. This would include when the applicant/resource provider is requesting withdrawal from a previously requested hearing and/or when the Children’s Division determines that information is inadequate to substantiate the agency’s proposed action and the agency wishes to rescind the decision. The Children’s Service Worker shall immediately send the completed and signed Withdrawal of Request for Hearing, CD-54, to the DLS Hearings Unit within one (1) working day. If the required written request is not received within the required 30 day time frame, proceed with closing the vendor with close reason of revocation. If this was an initial application denial and the written request is not received within the required time frame, select “deny” on the Application screen in FACES. If the issue was not resolved at the informal meeting and the applicant/resource parent did not withdrawal their request for a hearing, the worker will confer with the Division’s DLS legal counsel, as necessary, and provide him/her with any information necessary for hearing presentation. The worker will appear as a witness at the state hearing and present the basis for recommendation, citing licensing rules and assessment guidelines. The hearing officer will submit to the Division Director the proposed decision and order containing all the facts presented at the hearing. The DLS Hearings Unit at the Division of Legal Services will issue a copy of the final decision to the applicant/resource provider and Children’s Service Worker. Upon receipt of a notice of a desire to appeal the final decision, the DLS Hearings Unit will furnish the applicant/resource provider or his/her attorney, with the proper form of affidavit for filing the appeal to the circuit court of the county in which he/she resides. The applicant/resource provider has 90 days to file an appeal. The worker will wait for 90 days after the notice of the final decision is sent before entering a close reason for the home if the close reason is revocation or denial. The home shall remain on administrative hold during this time period. If no appeal is filed, the worker will proceed to enter the close reason. If an appeal is filed timely with the circuit court, no close reason is to be entered until the final decision of the circuit court. The home will remain on Administrative Hold until the final decision is made by the circuit court. If the court upholds the closing of the home, the worker will enter the revocation or denial in the system. If the court reverses the Division’s decision to close the home the home will remain open. Record the information regarding the case adverse action in the case record. Complete the Vendor Appeal Screen in FACES.

This decision will be made in consultation with the child (if mentally and physically capable of making the decision), biological parent, guardian, guardian ad litem, juvenile court, the child’s physician, the child’s Children’s Service Worker, care provider, and at least two physicians who have access to the child and the child’s records.  The final decision regarding the use of life support and DNR orders or removal of life support for children in the legal custody of the Division shall rest with the court or the family if the court agrees.  Children’s Division and the Department of Social Services will not take a partisan position on Life Support/Sustaining Therapies in those cases in which the doctors are recommending a DNR or removal of life support.  We will provide unbiased, objective facts to the court, but we will not make any recommendations as to the final outcome.  The Department’s position in these situations is that the decision must be made by the court after reasonable notice and an opportunity for a hearing is given to the child’s parents, the Guardian ad litem (GAL), the Juvenile Officer (JO) and any other interested parties to provide input into the case as appropriate.  The department will not take the position that the responsibility for making DNR or Removal of Life Support decisions should be vested in a foster parent or (former foster parent) or other third party unless ordered by the court. The wishes of a child with a life threatening illness may be taken into consideration when making major decisions regarding medical care for the child, especially a DNR decision as to what weight to give to the child’s wishes is a judgment that must be based on the individual facts of each case considering factors such as the ability of the child to understand his/her condition, to make decisions; the maturity of the child, the wishes of the parents and other parties. NOTE:  Life sustaining therapies are defined as tube feeding, respirator, physical therapies to sustain life, intravenous fluids (IV), etc. When circuit office staff is confronted with situations which require the continued use of life support systems or the removal of life sustaining therapies and those cases in which the doctors are recommending a DNR or removal of life support for children within the care and custody of the Children’s Division, staff shall: Immediately gather appropriate identifying and medical information including: Condition and prognosis of the child; Other pertinent information regarding the child, i.e., age, birth date and location; Parent(s) name and address; if there is no parent(s), then the nearest relative Most recent court order; and Other appropriate medical and identifying information. Notify immediately, via telephone, and provide an explanation of the child’s situation and appropriate information based on Step 1. Refer such situations to the office of the Children’s Division Director for review. CD shall not be the agency to file a motion with the court asking for the court to make a DNR or removal of Life Support decisions. The motion should be filed by the JO or the GAL or parent(s) whose parental rights have not been terminated. If the JO and/or GAL or parent(s) refuses to file such a motion, then Division of Legal Services may file a motion notifying the court that: The child is seriously ill and the doctors are recommending DNR or removal of Life Supports. The best practice would include a written statement from the doctor attached to the motion; CD does not make DNR or Removal of Life Support decisions and does not have a specific recommendation to make regarding the child; and CD requests that the court take evidence on the child’s condition and enter an appropriate order. Notify the birth parent(s)/kinship of the hearing. Notice of hearing must be in writing. It is preferable to deliver the notice personally, but if this is not possible then it should be sent by certified mail so there is documentation to show the efforts to notify interested parties.  If CD does not know the location of a parent or guardian CD/Division of Legal Services needs to take all reasonable steps to locate that individual and provide them reasonable notice so that they have an opportunity to present information to the court.  The steps taken to locate, the absent parent or guardian needs to be documented in the file. Notify the juvenile office and/or juvenile court immediately if the medical facility does not provide all appropriate information or there is a concern for the child’s health while a review is being conducted. Immediately submit a written report containing the information outlined above to the regional director. Before, during, and after the decision has been made to begin or discontinue life support systems, establish open communications with the birth parent(s), foster parent(s) and sibling(s) of the child. County office staff will update Regional Director, as necessary, on any changes in the child’s condition during the review process. Assist the family by providing or arranging contact with support groups, counseling or any other service necessary to aid the family in the event of the child’s death.

"MO :: Section 4, Chapter 4 (Working with Children), Subsection 3 – Medical and Behavioral Health Planning :: 4.3.7 Voluntary Placement Agreement",Missouri,Rules,"2023, 2022, 2021","Definitions, Placement",,,"With the 2004 passage of House Bill 1453, the Voluntary Placement Agreement was introduced and established in statute (210.122 RSMo). The Voluntary Placement Agreement is predicated upon the belief that no parent should have to relinquish custody of a child solely in order to access clinically indicated mental health services. Definition The Voluntary Placement Agreement (VPA) is a written agreement between the Department of Social Services (DSS)/Children’s Division (CD) and a parent, legal guardian, or custodian of a child under the age of eighteen (18) in need of mental health treatment.  The agreement is only used when an out-of-home placement is recommended by DMH and the Custody Diversion Protocol cannot otherwise divert the need for such placement.  DMH determines the need for mental health services and administers the placement and care of a child while the parent, legal guardian, or custodian of the child retains legal custody. Practice The VPA will only be made available to a parent in conjunction with, and only after staff has utilized the Custody Diversion Protocol which serves to link parents with DMH services for their child. The Custody Diversion Protocol reflects the mutual commitment of CD, DMH and its Community Mental Health Centers/Administrative Agents (CMHC/AA), Regional Offices, and/or Adolescent CSTAR providers, and the local Juvenile/Family Courts to assist parents in accessing needed mental health services for their children without a needless transfer of legal custody.  The VPA requires the commitment of a parent to be an active participant in his/her child’s treatment. A VPA may not exceed 180 days in duration . Local CD CDP Designees are responsible for guiding and assisting throughout the CDP process and monitoring the family’s progress through the duration of the VPA.  A Family Support Team (FST) meeting must be held within 72 hours of placement to develop permanency and treatment plans.  The local CD case worker will ensure FSTs are scheduled as necessary.  Designated staff from CD, Community Mental Health Centers, DMH Regional Office, and/or Adolescent CSTAR providers, the child’s family, and children who are able to effectively participate in meetings must be invited to attend all FSTs. FSTs need to be scheduled to occur around but not later than 100 and 150 days of the date the child is placed. The child and family’s progress will be reviewed to ensure appropriate transition planning occurs prior to the maximum 180 day VPA closure.  If the child is unable to return home a determination must be made as to continuous care being provided by other available resources or CD petitioning the court for custody.  The local Custody Diversion Protocol designees will be required to attend any hearings and testify in support of the plan to petition the court for custody. DMH may arrange for a staffing for a youth served through a VPA. The DMH provider will notify the local Custody Diversion Protocol designee of meetings held on the child’s behalf. The local Custody Diversion Protocol designee should maintain consistent communication with the DMH provider on each child served through a VPA. Children placed in Voluntary Placements are subject to the Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) requirements.  Within sixty (60) days of the date the child is removed from the home, a case plan must be developed.  To meet the requirements of Section 472 (a) (1) of the Social Security Act a removal from the home must occur pursuant to: A VPA entered into by a parent or guardian which leads to removal (i.e. a non-physical or paper removal of custody) of the child from the home; or A judicial order for removal of the child from a parent or specified relative. Financing Funding for treatment services under a VPA will be provided by DMH or the CMHC/AA, Regional Center, and/or Adolescent CSTAR provider up front with Department of Social Services appropriation accessed through an interdepartmental funds transfer. Local CD staff will not authorize payment for residential treatment or any other services for children placed through a VPA.  Youth active in a VPA will be eligible for MO HealthNet coverage through the Family Support Division. The youth’s SSI benefits and/or private insurance, as well as other means of financial support, must be explored prior to VPA approval.  If the family receives SSI benefits for the youth, it is the family’s responsibility to contact the Social Security Administration and inform them of an out-of-home placement. Procedure: As a part of the CDP, DMH must conduct an assessment and it should establish that out-of-home placement is clinically appropriate and if there are no other means of financial support, the local CD CDP Designee can explore a VPA. If it is determined that a VPA is to be requested, the agreement must be reviewed and signed by the parent(s) and the CD-CDP designee. At the time a VPA is presented to a parent, CD staff shall, in conjunction with the parent, complete the Children’s Severity of Psychiatric Illness (CSPI). The CSPI is included as part of the CS-9.  Staff do not have to complete the entire CS-9, only the CSPI. The signed agreement must then be sent to the CD Central Office designee responsible for the oversight of the VPA program for final approval. VPAs must be signed by the CD Central Office designee before it will be considered officially approved, and a placement made. If the VPA is approved, the CD-CDP designee will then send a copy of the agreement to the local DMH CDP Designee responsible for placement. The local DMH Administrative Agent, Regional Office or Adolescent CSTAR provider should send a copy of the signed agreement with the identified placement date back to the local CDP designee. This should be completed within 5 days of placement. If the identified placement provider is requesting rates which exceed the standard contract rate for the Division of Behavioral Health, CD Central Office review and prior approval is required. If the approved agreement is not returned with a placement date within five (5) days the CD-CDP should contact the DMH Administrative Agent, Regional Office or Adolescent CSTAR provider to request the begin date. A copy of the signed agreement will then be sent to the RCST Coordinator and Central Office designee responsible for the oversight of the VPA program within 10 days from receipt of the signed agreement with the placement date added.  The VPA begin date is the date the child is placed in an out-of-home setting for treatment.  The RCST Coordinator shall be responsible for entering the VPA begin date and the CSPI rehab date in FACES.  For additional instructions see CD09-103. VPAs may not exceed one hundred eighty (180) days in duration. In the event the child is in placement less than 180 days, subsequent agreements can only be approved with the authorization of the CD Director. Total period of placement under one or multiple VPAs shall not exceed 180 consecutive days from the first day the child is placed in out-of-home care. The DMH provider is to notify the local CD-CDP designee any time a child is returned home. It is the local CD-CDP designee’s responsibility to then notify the RCST Coordinator and the CD Central Office designee.  It is the RCST Coordinator’s responsibility to update FACES once a child is returned home.  The duration of the VPA may be for as short a period as the parties agree is in the best interests of the child. The FACES system will automatically close a youth (in legal status V) the day the length of a VPA reaches 180 days in duration and the day before the child reaches his/her eighteenth (18th) birthday. However, if a youth is returned home prior to the 180 day maximum, the FACES system should be updated with a close date one day following the date the youth returned home. NOTE: Although the FACES system will automatically close the SS-61 upon the youth’s eighteenth birthday a VPA may extend beyond such. The RCST Coordinator must update the FACES system to reflect one day following the actual date the youth returned home or the day the length of the VPA reaches 180 days in duration.

"MO :: Section 4, Chapter 4 (Working with Children), Subsection 3 – Medical and Behavioral Health Planning :: 4.3.5 Identification of Children in the Custody of the Children’s Division Solely for the Purpose of Accessing Mental Health Services",Missouri,Rules,"2023, 2022, 2021","Legal process, Reunification, Services while in care - Mental Health",,,"Parents should not have to relinquish custody of their child due solely to a need to access clinically indicated mental health services. Children in custody for that reason and absent a probable cause or preponderance of evidence CA/N finding may be eligible for return to the custody of their parents through a protocol established by the passage of Senate Bill 1003 (SB 1003) during the 2004 legislative session: Supervisory Review of Children Who Are in Division Custody Solely for Mental Health Services per Section 208.204.2 and 208.204.3 RSMo. Children who have entered Children’s Division custody, absent a probable cause or preponderance of evidence CA/N finding, should be carefully reviewed to determine if they meet the criteria that were contained in SB 1003 signed into law in 2004. The review of a child in CD custody and determination of meeting SB 1003 criteria must include the following: Is the child in the custody of the Division solely because the parents were unable to access or afford mental health needs of the child? Is the parent verbalizing a desire for the child’s return to his/her custody if the child could receive the necessary mental health services? Would the child’s safety or the safety of others in the home be compromised by such a return of custody? Should the parent of a child not previously identified as potentially meeting the eligibility criteria contact the CD expressing a belief that his/her child indeed meets these criteria, CD staff will respond to the request and inform the parent that an FST meeting will be convened within two weeks of the parent’s request. Convening the Family Support Team Once the review is completed and it appears that the reason for the initial placement may be due solely to a need to access clinically indicated mental health services, a Family Support Team (FST) meeting is to be convened by the CD case manager upon agreement with the child’s parents. This FST meeting should be scheduled and held within 2 weeks in order to begin the process for further assessment and planning. Current policy for FST meetings is to be observed in keeping with the requirements of Section 4, Chapter 7 of the Child Welfare Manual.  It is crucial that the child’s family be actively involved in the FST and planning process.  The case record should clearly document if the family states they are not yet ready to regain custody. Additional and crucial FST participants shall include: The local representatives of the Department of Mental Health’s (DMH) Community Mental Health Center and/or DMH Regional Office staff; and Representatives of current placement and treatment providers. If the child has developmental disabilities that can best be served by DD within DMH, this agency should be actively involved in the planning process. The focus of the FST meeting is to jointly determine if the child’s placement in CD was due solely to a need for mental health services and was unrelated to parental abuse, neglect, or abandonment. In addition, the team should determine if the child can be returned safely to the custody of the parent even if he/she continues to need out-of-home care. If consensus is not reached by the FST on whether the child meets the eligibility criteria, the child shall be considered inappropriate for the Senate Bill 1003 protocol.  This, however, should not exclude other efforts toward reunification or further steps to obtain clinically indicated services or supports through DMH. Development of an Individualized Plan to Return the Child to the Custody of the Parent and Request for a Court Hearing If the FST agrees that the family meets the criteria for SB 1003 and the parent desires to have the child returned to his/her custody, an individualized plan shall be developed which outlines all services and supports needed by the child and family and identifies who shall be financially responsible for each. The child, if appropriate and the family shall actively participate in the plan’s design. Identified services shall be provided in the least restrictive and most normalized environment. Treatment services and supports shall include but not be limited to those which are home and community based. This plan shall be submitted to the court within sixty (60) days of the child having been identified through consensus of the FST. The judge may then return custody of the child to the parent. Payment for Services Provided to the Child and Family Once Custody Has Been Returned to the Parent 208.204.4:  When children are returned to their family’s custody and become the service responsibility of the Department of Mental Health, the appropriate moneys to provide for the care of each child in each particular situation shall be billed to the Department of Social Services by the Department of Mental Health pursuant to a comprehensive financing plan developed by the two departments. The Children’s Division is committed to assuring that the child and family continue to have access to those services that help them meet the needs of the child. If the Division previously paid for such services, it will continue to do so.  It is not necessary for the child to be returned to the home of the parent in order for custody to be transferred.  To that end, the Division will continue to fund residential treatment if the child continues to need that service as identified through the individualized treatment plan. Staff should contact Central Office for assistance in payment to placement providers for any youth in need of continued residential placement but no longer in the Division’s legal custody. Ongoing Implementation of Sections 208.204 For youth who meet criteria under statute cited above and are not otherwise diverted from CD custody, staff should implement the above protocol as quickly as possible to help expedite the youth’s return to the custody of his/her parents. The issues relating to the child’s placement should be addressed as early as the initial 72-hour FST meeting.  The representation of DMH and the current placement provider(s) should be brought into the FST process as soon as possible to assist in the service planning. Within sixty (60) days of a child being identified as appropriate for the provisions of Section 208.204.2-3 RSMo. an individualized treatment plan shall be developed by the FST, and the Children’s Division shall submit the plan to the juvenile/family court judge for approval. The child may be returned by the judge to the custody of his/her family. The instructions for Form CS-1 have been revised to better document the needs of the child and family, see CS-1 in E-Forms Index. Issues relating to the child’s mental health needs and the services and supports that may be needed for his/her parents should be addressed in the ongoing FST meetings.  Special emphasis should be placed on determining if the child can be safely returned to his/her parents’ custody if the necessary mental health services and supports were in place.

If there are placements in the home, plans should be reviewed and discussed 90 days prior to the expiration date for where the children will be moved. Foster youth may not be in an unlicensed expired foster home without a court order. The resource development worker should take the following steps to renew the resource provider’s license prior to the end date of the resource parent’s licensure period. Renewal process should begin at minimum 90 days prior to expiration of the license: Consult with current and past case workers for each child currently in the home and who has been in the home in the previous two years to evaluate the ability of the resource parents to deal with foster/relative youth, the agency, and the biological parents. In compliance with 13 CSR 35-60.030 (3), re-evaluate the performance based competencies taught in the pre-service training: Protecting and nurturing; Meeting developmental needs and addressing developmental delays; Supporting relationships between children and families; Connecting children to lifetime relationships; and Working as a member of a professional team. Document the resource provider’s demonstration of acquisition of these skills and any concerns regarding delinquency or weakness so they can be addressed on the Professional Family Development Plan, CD-100. The CD-100 must be reviewed and renewed before re-licensure. Document specific examples of how the resource parent(s) demonstrated application of all the elements of Reasonable and Prudent Parenting Standard.

Provide Employee Reference form, CS-101c only if employment has changed since the last assessment, or if there are concerns about employment. Provide Informed Consent Flyer If any concerns are identified during quarterly home visits or the interview process for the home assessment amended for license renewal, the Personal Reference Request, CS-101f and/or the Employer Reference Request CS-101c may be utilized. These forms are designed for initial licensure. Provide a copy of the HIPAA Information for Resource Parents, CD-194, and obtain signature(s). If any household member smokes, discuss the locations and frequency that foster youth will be exposed to secondhand smoke.  Refer the family to the required pre-service video . Each resource parent completes the training and receives a one hour in-service training credit using code V113, Secondhand Smoke Exposure. Discuss the resource parent(s)’ plan to talk to foster youth about smoking and modeling healthy choices. Complete the Notification of Hazards, CS-101. Confirm there are no surveillance cameras in areas of the home that violate the privacy of the foster youth, e.g. bathrooms and dressing areas. Weapons 13 CSR 35-60.040 Staff must personally view any weapons and their storage to assure compliance with the licensing rules. Staff shall not violate statute 571.500 by requiring a list of the weapons that the resource parent owns or keeps in the home. Any and all firearms and ammunition not being carried on one’s person shall be stored in locked secured areas or cabinets with keys or other locking mechanisms so as to be inaccessible to children. Firearms and ammunition on one’s person in the presence of a foster child shall be held in a secure holster and not accessible to children subject to the following: No firearms shall be present in any vehicle transporting foster children unless the firearms are: in a locked glovebox, in a locked container, or in a secure holster inaccessible to children, when carried or concealed on a person possessing a concealed carry permit. (An exception will be made for any person transporting a foster child who must carry a weapon as part of their job responsibilities— i.e., law enforcement officers.) No firearms possessed in violation of a state or federal law or a local government ordinance shall be present at any time in the home, on any household member, or in any vehicle in which the children are riding. Weapons storage shall be made available for external viewing by Children’s Division staff in order to assure weapons are inaccessible to children. All medication (prescription, non-prescription or authorized) and alcohol shall be stored so as to be inaccessible to children, taking into consideration the age and mental capacities of the children taking and the youth. If the medications are accessible to foster youth, staff must document either a plan for making the medications inaccessible or an explanation of why the medications are allowed to be accessible by foster youth (i.e. a child is moving toward independent living and is learning self-sufficiency skills). The Foster/Adoptive Household Member Physical and Mental Health Report, CW-215, is to be completed for each resource parent and biological or adopted child in the home by the physician for license renewal, but not including any current foster youth placements. Ascertain the resource provider has completed the recommended number of in-service resource parent training hours prior to recommendation for license renewal. STARS Pre-Service training hours may not be counted toward the 30 hours of In-Service training required for license renewal. All the following training must be complete for license renewal: Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation certification , CPR; Three training hours credit using code V252 First Aid; Three training hours credit using code V898 Health Information Portability and Accountability ,HIPAA; One hour of training credit for reading and signing the CD-194 using code V980. The form is read and signed at each license renewal. However, the training credit is only earned for the initial time. Reasonable and Prudent Parenting Standard; Two training hours credit using code V280. This must be completed within three months of license/approval begin date. Foster Care bill of Rights: one hour training credit using code V160. Informed Consent; Two training hours credit using code V150. Psychotropic Medication Interactive trainings provided annually using training code V170 Establish continued compliance with licensing rules. The applicant is to complete a new Foster Family Profile, CD-56, if not already completed. The CD-56 should be completed as changes occur in the household. The new CD-56 and family photograph should be placed under separate cover sheet (to be developed locally) and placed in the front of the Resource Provider file. The obsolete CD-56 should be placed in the Family Assessment Section of the Resource Provider file with a notation on the front page of the profile identifying it as obsolete. A current CD-56 is required to be in the file for license renewal. There is to be no printed document (CA/N, FACES Call/Case History page, etc.) placed in the file. Document in the home assessment that the CA/N check was completed and the results of the check. Criminal History; Staff should not list specifics in the narrative section of the file when documenting criminal history. The narrative should simply reflect one of the following: The results of the fingerprint based criminal background check (enter date) met eligibility requirements and there have been no reports of criminal activity during the licensure period; The results of the fingerprint based criminal background check conducted (enter date) met eligibility requirements for licensure, however during the licensure period there have been(enter number) Rap Back  criminal history reports received which require further review and The reports do not include exclusionary information for licensure eligibility, or The information from the reports resulted in the decision to revoke the license. Specific criminal history information may be included in the Resource Home Adverse Action Report, CS-20, when it is the basis for denial or revocation. 25. If during the re-licensure process it is determined that the award of a foster care license is to be denied or revoked, all supporting documentation for the adverse action shall be retained for utilization during the fair hearing process as outlined in previous paragraph. This documentation shall be placed in the Administrative section of the resource provider case record. The decision to deny or revoke a foster care license must be based on non-compliance and or not meeting competencies with statute and licensing rules. Request a report on each adult household member from the Family Care Safety Registry (FCSR). The worker can do one of the following: Access the FCSR on-line with their assigned ID and password (preferred), or Call the FCSR at 1-866-422-6872. The resource development worker obtains on-line access by doing the following: Go to the FCSR home page, www.dhss.mo.gov/fcsr ; Click on the Forms link; Click on the How to Become a FCSR Internet User link; Click on the Internet Background Screening Access/Security Request . Return the completed document by Fax to 573-522-6981, or by mail to: DHSS/Family Care Safety Registry, PO Box 570,Jefferson City, MO 65102 In response the FCSR will assign a USER ID number to the resource development worker to be used exclusively for access to the FCSR. The USER ID and instructions on how to do the password and how to run a background screening will be faxed to the worker. This ID and instructions on how to do the password are autonomous from the worker’s current ID and passwords used for logging on to the state computer system, FACES and PROD. The password is on a 30-day expiration cycle and the worker will have to update it every 30 days, just as with the PROD password. Families who do not have Social Security numbers due to their religious practices (i.e. Amish) are not required to register with the FCSR and note of this should be documented in their record and study. 24. The address of residence of the resource home will be entered at the Missouri State Highway Patrol’s sexual offender list located on the web at: https://statepatrol.dps.mo.gov/ . The address search will determine if a sexual offender is registered as residing at the address of the resource home. A copy of the resulting web page must be placed in the background section of the case file. 25. Examine Case.net, the Missouri State Courts Automated Case Management System for any reference to Orders of Protection filed, either for a child or adult. There are limits to the use of Case.net. Case.net is not yet statewide, so will not include all county circuit courts. Also, at this time, public view does not include identifiers such as social security numbers and birth dates; so it is difficult to determine whether the individual for whom you are searching is the same as the one found on Case.net. In locations where Case.net is not yet available, check with the circuit court for any pertinent information, including a record of Orders of Protection filed, both for a child or an adult. 26.  The DSS Inquiry function located on the FACES Home Page is an available tool that may be used for information gathering. This same process shall be used for Transitional Living Advocates (TLA), and foster or adoptive parents being assessed for the Division through a contracted agency. Except for the specific felony convictions listed below, a criminal history, child abuse/neglect history, or other review information does not automatically preclude licensure. Staff should determine the relevance of all such findings to child caring responsibilities, and should seek guidance from supervisors. A supervisor must review and evaluate the background information if there is a record of conviction (other than those listed below) and/or child abuse and if the decision is to approve the home study. The supervisor’s review and decision to approve/disapprove must be documented. Felony Convictions Staff may not approve the application of any person in which a record check reveals that a felony conviction for child abuse or neglect, spousal abuse, a crime against children (including child pornography), or a crime involving violence, including rape, sexual assault, or homicide, but not including other physical assault or battery was determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. Staff may also not approve the application of any person who has had a court of competent jurisdiction determine a felony conviction for physical assault, battery, or a drug-related offense within the past five (5) years. For the purpose of this policy, a “felony conviction by a court of competent jurisdiction” is defined as a criminal court conviction for a felony offense as defined by law in the jurisdiction that the offense took place. Household members age 17 and older shall disclose criminal history. Consideration shall be made of felony cases where the individual pled guilty, is found guilty and /or convicted of a criminal offence or pled guilty but received a suspended imposition of sentence instead (SIS). In the unlikely event that it is determined that the best interest of a child would be served by placement in this setting, written approval must be obtained through supervisory lines to the Regional Office. The Regional Office must review the request and, if in agreement, forward with their recommendation to Central Office for final consideration. Written requests should include a thorough description of the applicant’s situation and why it would be in the child’s best interest for an exception to be granted. If approved by Central Office, IV-E funding may not be used and the worker will be responsible for notifying the Eligibility Specialist who will ensure that state-only funds are used. If a resource parent commits a felony act as listed previously in this section which results in a conviction or the resource parent admits to committing the act and receives an suspended imposition of sentence (SIS ) federal funds may not be used for foster care maintenance or adoption assistance payments if any of the aforementioned conditions exist. It is imperative that in those circumstances the worker notifies the Eligibility Specialist who will enter the correct fund code for state only funding.

"MO :: Section 6, Chapter 3 (Resource Family Assessment and Licensing Process), Subsection 4, – (Child Care Homes as Foster Homes)",Missouri,Rules,2023,"Foster parent licensing, Legal process",,,"When a resource home applicant has a valid child care license with the Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS), Section for Child Care Regulation (SCCR), and/or provides child care on the behalf of the Children Division as a registered or contracted provider, considerations must be made regarding conflicts with foster home licensing rule and policy. Discuss the Foster Family Home Licensing Rules 13 CSR 35-60 with the resource home applicant. For children receiving child care through the Child Care Assistance program, resource parents are considered to be a mandatory member of the child’s household unit. Resource parents are standing in loco parentis and are not allowed to provide registered or licensed child care to their own children including any foster child(ren) placed in their home. The resource parent must select another child care provider for the foster child(ren) placed in their home. Refer to the Child Care Assistance Manual for Child Care Assistance program requirements. Inform the foster home applicant of the regulation capacity and age limitations including but not limited to: No foster child under the age of seven (7) may be placed in a combined resource home/licensed child care provider family home with the exception of those in a sibling group. Registered, licensed, contracted child care providers (owners) cannot be paid for providing child care for their own children. Their own children impact total capacity of children in the home. Foster children are considered their own children. For combined resource home/registered family home provider, there may only be a maximum of four (4) non related children in the home. The number of foster children shall not cause the resource home/licensed child care family home to exceed the child care provider’s licensed capacity. The maximum number of children in a resource home shall not exceed five (5) including any of the foster parents’ own children. Resource parent(s) shall not provide care for more than two (2) children under age two (2) and no more than four (4) children under the age of five (5) unless necessary to accommodate a sibling group on a temporary basis. If licensed with the DHSS/SCCR, discuss the Licensing Rules for Family Day Care Homes, 19 CSR 30-61 with the resource home applicant. Care of foster youth by a licensed resource parent shall not be combined with regular, part, or full-time care of other children, or with other service or business conducted in the home without written approval of the division (13 CSR 35-60.050(2)(E). Discuss with the resource home applicant the impact of providing care to both foster care children and child care children. Ensure that holding a resource home license while providing licensed or registered child care in the home will not adversely affect children receiving these services. Refer to Section 6 Chapter 3 subsection 1 for licensing guidelines.

"MO :: Section 6, Chapter 3 (Resource Family Assessment and Licensing Process), Subsection 3, – (Foster Licensing, Adoptive Assessments)",Missouri,Rules,2023,"Adoption, Foster parent licensing, Legal process, Permanency",,,"NOTE: A child in Children’s Division (CD) custody can reach the goal of adoption permanency in one of two ways: adoption by the current foster/relative family or placement with a new family. A foster/relative family must be assessed for adoption if they want to adopt a child in their care. An approved adoptive family must be licensed for foster/adoptive care (FA) if that family requires temporary financial assistance to meet the needs of the child. A foster/adoptive care (FA) license does not apply to foster/relative families already licensed unless maintenance and special services payment is denied because the child is not eligible for Homeless, Dependent, and Neglected (HDN). Relative families, not eligible for maintenance and special expense payments, may become eligible for the foster/adoptive care (FA) license by becoming approved as an adoptive family. Out-of-Home Care payments may be continued until custody is transferred, the adoption subsidy agreement is approved for an eligible child or the child is removed from the home, whichever occurs first. If the child is eligible for adoption subsidy, the transfer of custody or the final adoption must be coordinated with the approval of the agreement for subsidy. This will prevent a break in payment. NOTE: “FA” refers to the vendor type code is used to identify that an approved adoptive family has been licensed to provide foster/adoptive care (FA). This code, in combination with the placement type code, “FAH”, differentiates this type of placement plan for a child from adoption by foster parents (foster/adoptive family) who have had that child in their care. The “FA” and “FAH” codes must be reported when the foster/adoptive care (FA) license is approved. A foster or relative family vendor type would be reported as an “AD” vendor type in the ACTS vendor subsystem when the adoption of the child is approved. In FACES, the child’s placement type would be reported as “ADF” or “ADR,” whichever is appropriate. A vendor may provide more than one type of care. Special action is required in the FACES vendor subsystem when this occurs. The foster/adoptive care (FA) license is generated when the “FA” code is reported in the vendor subsystem. The license is sent to the County Office for transmittal to the family. The Children Services Worker will pursue licensure of an already approved adoptive family for foster/adoptive care (FA) when the family has been selected for and has accepted a child, if temporary financial assistance is needed. NOTE: CD approved adoptive families may be licensed to provide foster/adoptive care (FA) for children in the custody of Class I juvenile courts and authorized to receive out-of-home care payments and Medicaid. However, financial assistance shall end when custody is transferred or the child is removed, whichever occurs first. Children in the custody of Class I juvenile courts are not eligible for adoption subsidy. Complete an adoptive assessment for a foster/relative family who wants to adopt a child in their care. Determine that an approved adoptive family meets foster/adoptive care (FA) licensing requirements by receiving a copy of the adoption petition for a specific child, and discussing and obtaining the necessary signatures for the CM-6, Cooperative Agreement for the Purchase of Foster/Adoptive Care (FA) Services. NOTE: A petition for adoption may be filed before the child is physically placed with the family. Record all information appropriate to the assessment or licensing requirements. Make a recommendation for licensure of an approved adoptive family for foster/adoptive care (FA). Submit completed CM-6 to Contract Management Unit. Receive notice of approved CM-6 from Contract Management Unit. Extend a foster/adoptive care (FA) license for subsequent periods of up to nine months until custody is transferred, the Adoption Subsidy Agreement is approved for an eligible child, or the child is removed, whichever occurs first. NOTE: It is not necessary that placement of the child actually occur for the contract to be signed. But, placement should occur within a reasonable time after licensure. Also, while the license may be extended to accommodate movement in the adoption proceedings, the case plan should include, if needed, actions that will complete the adoption without unreasonable delays. Make a recommendation for approval of a licensed foster/relative family to adopt the child in their care. Maintain accurate Vendor Licensure/Approval and Renewal screen in FACES. Open vendor for foster/adoptive care (FA) for up to nine months, if needed. NOTE: This includes relative families who are not eligible to receive payment because the child is HDN eligible only. The relative parent(s) must be approved as an adoptive family before licensed as a foster/adoptive (FA) family. Open the licensed foster/relative family as an adoptive family (AD) when the adoption case plan for a specific child in their care is approved. NOTE: Relative adoptions include only licensed relative families caring for a IV-E eligible child. Transmit license to foster/adoptive care (FA) family; or Notify foster/relative family of approval as an adoptive home. Allow foster/adoptive care (FA) license to expire for the following reasons: Family receives custody of the child; Child is removed from the home; Family requests termination of the foster/adoptive care (FA) license; Adoption Subsidy Agreement (CS-SA-2) is approved; or Adoption is granted if no prior transfer of custody. When the license expires, close the FA vendor type in FACES. Follow revocation of license steps in 3.1 of this chapter, if child is removed because a CA/N investigation has found “Preponderance of Evidence” and child is not safe by remaining with the family. Record all activities, as necessary, and depending on the category of the family adopting the child.

Completion of all required pre-service training: Introduction to Missouri Foster and Respite Care Provider training, two (2) hours STARS Pre-service training, 27 hours Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR), three (3) hours First Aid, three (3) hours Psychotropic Medication Management, two (2) hours Informed Consent, two (2) hours Compliance with the physical aspects of licensing regulations must be determined. A minimum of three references, returned. A completed Foster Family Profile, CD-56. Review FACES screens regarding history with the Division. Begin with Call Case Prior History Search. Review appropriate screens to verify prior history of licensure and or contracting as a resource provider. Request a report on each adult household member from the Family Care Safety Registry (FCSR). The worker can do one of the following: Access the FCSR on-line with their assigned ID and password (preferred), or Call the FCSR at 1-866-422-6872. The resource development worker obtains on-line access by doing the following: Go to the FCSR home page, www.dhss.mo.gov/fcsr ; Click on the Forms link; Click on the How to Become a FCSR Internet User link; Click on the Internet Background Screening Access/Security Request. Return the completed document by Fax to 573-522-6981, or by mail to: DHSS/Family Care Safety Registry, PO Box 570,Jefferson City, MO 65102 In response the FCSR will assign a USER ID number to the resource development worker to be used exclusively for access to the FCSR. The USER ID and instructions on how to do the password and how to run a background screening will be faxed to the worker. This ID and instructions on how to do the password are autonomous from the worker’s current ID and passwords used for logging on to the state computer system, FACES and PROD. The password is on a 30-day expiration cycle and the worker will have to update it every 30 days, just as with the PROD password.Families who do not have Social Security numbers due to their religious practices (i.e. Amish) are not required to register with the FCSR and note of this should be documented in their record and study. The address of residence of the resource home will be entered at the Missouri State Highway Patrol’s sexual offender list located on the web at: http://www.mshp.dps.missouri.gov/MSHPWeb/Root/index.html . The address search will determine if a sexual offender is registered as residing at the address of the resource home. A copy of the resulting web page must be placed in the background section of the case file. Examine Case.net, the Missouri State Courts Automated Case Management System for any reference to Orders of Protection filed, either for a child or adult. There are limits to the use of Case.net. Case.net is not yet statewide, so will not include all county circuit courts. Also, at this time, public view does not include identifiers such as social security numbers and birth dates; so it is difficult to determine whether the individual for whom you are searching is the same as the one found on Case.net. In locations where Case.net is not yet available, check with the circuit court for any pertinent information, including a record of Orders of Protection filed, both for a child or an adult. For criminal record checks, resource providers must have fingerprint background checks completed using the process outlined in Section 6 Chapter 3 Attachment A. This same process shall be used for Transitional Living Advocates (TLA), and foster or adoptive parents being assessed for the Division through a contracted agency. The DSS Inquiry function located on the FACES Home Page is an available tool that may be used for information gathering. Background checks shall be completed for every applicant and adult household member (age 17 and older). Supporting documentation of each step is to be filed in the licensing record. The same steps are to be followed in the completion of any ICPC assessment as are followed for licensure as referenced in Memorandums CD04-63 and CD07-44. Details regarding all required background checks are located in Chapter 19 of this section. Except for the specific felony history listed below, a criminal history, child abuse and neglect history, or other review information does not automatically preclude licensure. Staff should determine the relevance of all such findings to child caring responsibilities, and should seek guidance from supervisors. A supervisor must review and evaluate the background information if there is a record of conviction (other than those listed below) and or child abuse and if the decision is to approve the home assessment. The supervisor’s review and decision to approve or disapprove must be documented. Felony Convictions Staff may not approve the application of any person in which a record check reveals that the individual pled guilty or was found guilty of a felony for child abuse or neglect, spousal abuse, domestic violence, a crime against children (including child pornography), or a crime involving violence, including rape, sexual assault, homicide but not including  other physical assault or battery was determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. Staff may also not approve the application of any person who has had a court of competent jurisdiction determine a felony conviction for physical assault, battery, or a drug-related offense within the last five years. Household members age 17 and older shall disclose criminal history. Consideration shall be made of felony cases where the individual pled guilty, is found guilty and /or convicted of a criminal offense or pled guilty but instead received a suspended imposition of sentence (SIS). In the unlikely event it is determined the best interest of a child would be served by placement in an unlicensed home, and a court of law has ordered the child placed in the unlicensed home, written approval must be obtained through supervisory lines to the Regional Director. The Regional Director must review the request and, if in agreement, forward with their recommendation to the Deputy Director for Children’s Division for final consideration. Written requests should include a thorough description of the applicant’s situation and why it would be in the child’s best interest to be placed in an unlicensed home. If approved by the Deputy Director, IV-E funding may not be used and the worker will be responsible for notifying the Eligibility Specialist who will ensure that state only funds are used. If a resource parent commits a felony act as listed previously in this section which results in a conviction or the resource parent admits to committing the act and receives a suspended imposition of sentence (SIS ) federal funds may not be used for foster care maintenance or adoption assistance payments if any of the aforementioned conditions exist. It is imperative that in those circumstances the worker notifies the Eligibility Specialist who will enter the correct fund code for state only funding. The Assessment Process Includes Orientation to agency and foster care program, as contained in Specialized Training Assessment Resources and Support (STARS) Pre-Service Training and given through individual interviews. Completion of 27 hours of STARS Pre-Service Training is required of each adult desiring licensure prior to issuance of a license. All adults in the household who will have child care responsibility will be required to attend state approved resource parent training. During the assessment process, the worker should evaluate the ability of the applicant(s) to read and write at a level necessary to participate effectively in society. The applicant must be able to communicate with the agency, health care and other service providers. The applicant must also be able to communicate with the foster youth in the foster youth’s language. Obtain a photograph from family of the household members, including pets, if applicable, in front of their home. A household member is any person who regularly lives, shares common area and sleeps in the home. Any individual who is living, sharing a common area and sleeping in the home temporarily for more than two consecutive weeks is considered a household member. ,As this will be used in helping prepare a child for placement, include as much detail as possible. This photograph is to be placed with the Foster Family Profile, CD-56, under separate cover sheet and placed in the front of the Resource Provider record. The family’s photograph and the Foster Family Profile, CD-56, will serve as the Foster Family Profile. The following forms are to be reviewed with the applicant(s), agreed to by the applicant(s), signed by the applicant(s), placed in the forms section of the resource provider case record, and presented at each re-licensure to be signed and agreed to again. Safe Sleep Practices Form, CD-117 Resource Parent Discipline Agreement, CD-119 HIPAA Information for Resource Parents, CD-194 A copy of The Foster Parent Bill of Rights and Responsibilities, RSMo 210.566 is to be provided to the applicant. A copy of the Foster Care Bill of Rights, RSMo 210.564 is to be provided to the applicant. An exchange of information should occur between the resource development worker and applicant that will promote discussion to determine if the applicant is able to parent children who have different cultural needs than the applicant. This is to be done with all applicants and should not be used to discourage an applicant from parenting trans-culturally. Record all information in the assessment.

Selected Out as a resource provider for the Children’s Division: Explain recommendation if it is to deny an individual or family as applicants, remembering that such a decision should not be a surprise to the applicants. Such a recommendation can be made any time during the home assessment process. Also, remember that the worker should be honest with the applicant regarding the decision, recognizing the applicant’s sensitivity and tolerance. Selection out of resource parenting services requires the resource development worker to be prepared to provide documentation of facts that support the applicant(s) is not in compliance with Statute, Rule and Policy if the applicant(s) should request a fair hearing to pursue a grievance of the decision.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/mo-section-6-chapter-3-resource-provider-family-assessment-process-subsection-1-313-guide

The division may also deny or revoke a license to any person(s) who are on the respective Department of Health and Senior Services and or the Department of Mental Health lists that exclude child or adult care employment and or licensure. Administrative Hold is used during the period of evaluation and consideration of amelioration. Recommend revocation of license status using the Resource Home Adverse Action Report, CS-20, through supervisory lines to the Regional Director’s office: Identify and document the areas of non-compliance; In the summary, cite licensing rule(s) on which the decision is based. The summary must contain clear and cogent facts to support staff’s recommendations for revocation of license. When adverse action is CAN related, submit a copy of Child Abuse and Neglect Investigation or Family Assessment Summary, CPS-1. If it is decided the resource parents should no longer provide out-of-home care, immediately start the revocation procedure. Do not allow license simply to expire. Receive confirmation from Regional Director of agreement with revocation recommendation. Notify resource family by personal contact of recommended adverse action. Notify resource family by registered mail with the Notification of Resource Home Adverse Action letter, CS-20a, of revocation, citing licensing rule(s). Notify foster and relative foster parents of their right to the fair hearing process.

Do not enter a revocation in FACES until the time frames have been met for due process. Retrieve all foster parent identification cards and approval certificates issued to the resource providers. Record revocation activities. Close record. If the Regional Director or designee does not uphold revocation recommendation, continue licensure status. The worker must obtain the applicant’s signature on the home assessment indicating agreement. The applicant’s signature is also needed if the worker has decided to deny licensure. The signature indicates that the applicant has reviewed the assessment. When recommending revocation, cite action taken by the agency to help the family resolve the situation causing the problem(s). Describe what services have been offered to the family and the results.

"MO :: Section 6, Chapter 3 (Resource Provider Family Assessment Process), Subsection 1 :: 3.1.1 Administrative Hold",Missouri,Rules,2023,"Administrative process, Foster parent licensing, Placement, Reporting requirements",,,"Administrative Hold is used in responding to certain licensing situations which will more effectively serve resource parents, the Children’s Division and most importantly, the safety of children. All suspensions entered on the Vendor Licensure Approval and Renewal FACES page, require notification of an adverse action which is open to appeal. The Administrative Hold status reflects a less punitive and negative connotation and is not open to appeal. The Administrative Hold status does not prevent the license or approval from expiring. Depending on the nature of the allegation and the risk assessment, the provider may be placed on Administrative Hold with a corrective action and support plan implemented with no other children placed in the home until the issue is resolved and the Hold status is removed. If no immediate safety risk factors exist to the children during the investigation assessment (IA), the children currently in the home should not be removed. If, at the time of the investigation assessment, it is determined the child will be removed, either at the request of the resource provider or by the investigator, the child’s case manager should be notified in order to schedule a Family Support Team meeting. The resource development worker should be having and documenting their regular, ongoing discussions with the resource provider regarding any licensing concerns prior to a change in their licensing status. For an Administrative Hold, the resource development worker should notify the provider via a phone call as soon as possible. A follow-up letter should then be sent explaining why the Hold is in effect and how it can be removed or resolved. If the Hold was requested by the provider, the resource development worker should follow up with a letter verifying their request. Administrative Hold is required in the following circumstances: An Out-of-Home Investigation (OHI) is under way involving Legal Status 1 children in the resource provider’s home. The Administrative Hold should remain in effect until the investigation is concluded and all corrective actions and support plans, if any, are successfully completed and documented in the record. A CAN investigation or assessment is under way involving non-Legal Status 1 children in the resource provider’s household. The Administrative Hold should remain in effect until the IA is concluded and all corrective actions and support plans, if any, are successfully completed and documented in the record. Licensing concerns have been noted and a staffing is under way. The Administrative Hold should remain in effect until all corrective actions and support plans, if any, are successfully completed and documented in the record. A status of Administrative Hold does not prevent the license from expiring. If licensing concerns are not resolved before the license expires, the home is closed. All licenses and approvals must be renewed prior to the expiration date. If a resource home does not complete all the requirements at least ninety (90) days prior to the expiration, the License and Approval Renewal Letter, CD102, is sent to the resource family reporting the requirements necessary for the home to be renewed. If the home continues to not meet renewal requirements, the CD-102 letter should be sent again sixty (60) days prior to the expiration date. If the home continues to not meet renewal requirements thirty (30) days prior to the expiration date, the CD-102 should be sent again and the home placed on Administrative Hold. Administrative Hold status does not prevent the license or approval from expiring. It does, however, allow for data entry in the comment section on the Licensure and Approval and Renewal Screen in FACES regarding the facts of why the home is being placed on Administrative Hold. Level A, Level B, Medical, Respite, and Level B Respite, are vendor types not licenses. The decisions to deny or revoke are not open for appeal as these are contractual services decisions and not licensure decisions. If there are placements in the home, plans should be initiated for the children to be moved. Foster youth may not be in an unlicensed foster home without a court order. (The only exception is a relative applicant who is pursuing licensure. Foster youth may remain in the unlicensed relative home for up to ninety (90) days while the applicants are pursuing licensure.) A resource provider moving to another county, circuit or agency should be placed on Administrative Hold. The resource provider has experienced a significant change in household composition, health, employment, etc. The Administrative Hold should remain in effect until the provider’s situation has been reassessed and the home assessment has been updated. Every effort should be made to complete these actions within two (2) weeks, per the Council on Accreditation (COA). The worker should document all attempts to meet this timeframe, including the provider’s specific actions of non-compliance within that time. The Administrative Hold is available, but optional in a variety of circumstances, such as, but not limited to: The resource provider has had a new birth and needs time to adjust. The resource provider feels they need “a break”. The Family Support Team has recommended that the resource provider cease new placements during the period of adjustment for an adopted child. The resource provider has a biological ot adopted child placed in residential care. Per memo CD05-22, no additional children will be placed in the home without the approval of the Circuit Manager (CM) or designee. The provider may need time to work with the child placed in residential care. If there are questions whether an Administrative Hold or suspend should be implemented, staff should consult with first or second level supervisors for guidance. The Administrative Hold is selected as the suspend reason on the Vendor Licensure, Approval and Renewal screen in FACES. The Administrative Hold status does not prevent the license or approval from expiring.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/mo-section-6-chapter-3-resource-provider-family-assessment-process-subsection-1-311
"MO :: Section 6, Chapter 3 (Resource Provider Family Assessment Process), Subsection 1 :: Intro",Missouri,Rules,2023,"Administrative process, Definitions, Foster parent licensing, Placement, Reporting requirements",,,"Licensing of Foster Family Home Rules are located on the Secretary of State web page, 13 CSR 35-60 . This procedure will be followed for resource provider home assessments. The Children’s Division is the licensing entity for Missouri resource provider homes. The Children’s Division may contract with private agencies to develop resource homes. The private agency developing and or maintaining a resource home follows Children’s Division policy. When developing or re assessing a resource provider home, the contractor makes one of the following recommendations to the Children’s Division: License or approve a home; Deny issuance of a license or approval of a home they are developing; Revoke a current open license or approval of a resource home they are maintaining. The Children’s Division makes the determination of the recommendation. A Foster Family Home Applicant is one (1) or two (2) primary adult individuals(s) who live in the same household and complete and submit a prescribed application to provide foster care services as parent substitute(s) to foster youth placed in the home. When two (2) individuals are applying; Both individuals must be assessed separately as if they were applying as a single individual, If either applicant cannot be approved, the application shall be denied; and If both applicants are approved, a single license certificate shall be granted listing the names of both applicants. The applicant(s) for a license or renewal of a license shall provide any and all documentation and shall execute such authorizations to release information that the Children’s’ Division may determine to be necessary or convenient to obtain information about the applicant(s) and members of the applicant’s household. If the applicant or any member of the applicant’s household, fails without good cause to provide the information or fails to execute an authorization to release the information, the division may deny the license. Step 1 When an inquiry is received about becoming a foster or adoptive resource provider, the individual shall be provided: “Intro to Foster Care” and “Respite Provider Handbook” training located at the following link Children’s Division | Missouri Department of Social Services (mo.gov) ; Foster Adopt Home Assessment Application, CS-42; and Foster Family Profile; CD-56 When the completed Foster Adopt Home Assessment Application, Foster Family Profile and the Respite Provider Quiz is received, an application should be opened in FACES. In order to open an application, the worker must first verify if there is an existing Departmental Vendor Number (DVN) in FACES for the applicant(s). If there is not an existing DVN, the worker will assign a DVN to the applicant(s). Once a DVN is assigned or identified, the worker will enter an application with the date the application was received. The worker’s recommendation of the application shall not be entered until: The certainty of approving the application, or Receipt of written request by the applicant to withdraw the application, or All due process is complete if denying the application. Step 2 Initiate action within thirty (30) days of receipt of the application by: Beginning pre-service training; Face-to-face contact; or Group informational, orientation meeting. Step 3 Make referral for fingerprinting and registration with the Family Care Safety Registry. Step 4 If background checks are clear, make referral to STARS training. Step 5 Begin mutual selection process by personal interview. Step 6 Assist applicant with enrollment in Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). Assist applicant with enrollment in First Aid Training. Step 7 Direct applicant to complete the required pre-service training, Psychotropic Medication Management, V013. Step 8 Complete the non-related resource home assessment and make a recommendation within 120 days using the Guide for Conducting Resource Provider Family Assessments located in subsection 3.1.3 of this section. Record the home assessment per the outlines provided in Section 6 Chapter 3 subsection 8. Explain the requirement of compliance with licensing rules, 13 CSR 35-60 for foster and relative foster families. A child may be placed in a relative home prior to licensure, but only after a safety inspection of the home, Child Abuse and Neglect screening, and Purpose Code X criminal checks are completed. See Section 6.16, Relative Foster Care for background screening procedures for family and agency arranged kinship care, and Section 6 Chapter 19 subsection 1 for detailed fingerprinting procedure. The relative family will be paid a maintenance payment equal to the traditional foster care payment rate from the date of placement while pursuing completion of the licensing requirements. This shall be no longer than Ninety (90) days . Until the home is fully licensed, the maintenance payment is made with state-only funds; IV-E reimbursement cannot be made . Relative providers are required to complete STARS or STARS “For the Caregiver Who Knows the Child” training as a condition of licensure. Step 9 Obtain applicant’s signature on the home assessment indicating agreement; applicant retains one copy. The home assessment is not completed until the applicant, provider, worker, and worker’s supervisor have signed and dated the home assessment. Step 10 Update the vendor screens in FACES. Step 11 Provide a Foster Parent Identification Card. Have the resource provider complete the DSS ID Card Application . Local staff may take a picture of the resource parent with a digital camera or have the licensed resource parent provide an electronic picture in a jpeg file. Local staff submits the application and jpeg file to assigned Central Office clerical who uploads the information. The card is printed by HRC and returned to the clerical who sends the card to the local office. Step 12 Provide and obtain signed Cooperative Agreement for the Purchase of Professional Foster Care Services, CM-14. License Issuance Recommend issuance of license to resource providers for a two-year period. The license is not transferable and applies only to the foster family home to whom it is issued. Upon approval, a single license certificate listing the individual(s) is issued. Only one license may be issued per household. The license is the property of the division, not the licensee, and is subject to revocation upon failure of the individual(s) to comply with licensing regulations The license certificate shall be kept on the premises of the home. The license is a public record and shall, upon request, be made available for inspection. License Denial Recommend denial using the Resource Home Adverse Action Report, CS-20, through supervisory lines to the Regional Director: Include a summary of the licensing rules on which the decision is based. When an adverse action is CAN related, submit to the Regional Director or designee a copy of the Child Abuse and Neglect Investigation Family Assessment Summary (CPS-1), and Safety Assessment (CD-17). When recommended adverse action is denial, submit a copy of the home assessment to the Regional Director or designee. Receive confirmation from the Regional Director or designee of denial decision. Notify applicant, by personal contact, of recommended adverse action. Notify applicant by registered mail with the Notification of Resource Home Adverse Action letter, CS-20a, of adverse action taken and of procedure for fair hearing. If no response within thirty (30) calendar days of written notice or after agency decision is upheld in fair hearing process, close the license in FACES with a close reason of denial. Do not enter the denial of the application until the applicant has completed all the due process time frames. Refer to Section 6 Chapter 7 regarding the Children’s Division’s licensing decision appeal processes. License Maintenance and Renewal The resource development worker should encourage the resource provider to set up a bookkeeping system whereby detailed records are kept of expenditures for tax purposes. The assessment should be updated any time there is a significant change in the family situation within two (2) weeks of the resource development worker being notified of the change. A significant change would be a change in household composition, move from one residence to another, major physical changes in the home, death of family member, debilitating illness of a household member, etc. If the update is due to a physical move or physical change in residence, reference must be made to licensing regulation compliance. If the household contains weapons, the worker must personally observe that the storage of the weapons complies with Division policy and foster home licensing rules. The worker will not require the resource provider to list all the weapons in the home or sign a document regarding the weapons in the home. A new Foster Family Profile, CD-56, is to be completed at the time of license renewal, unless there is already a current up-to-date profile in the file. The CD-56 is to be updated when there are changes in the household composition that impact the information gathered on the form. In order to comply with Council on Accreditation (COA) regarding emergency preparedness, the resource development worker must document that the resource provider has read and understands the Children’s Division’s policy regarding Prevention and Control of Contagious and Infectious Diseases as found in the Missouri Resource Parent Handbook . Related Subject: Department of Social Services, Human Resource Center, Emergency Management and Safety, Family Disaster Plan . Update the appropriate screens in FACES. Evaluate a resource provider’s continued eligibility at a minimum on a quarterly basis within required license renewal time period. A resource provider moving to another  county or circuit should be placed on Administrative Hold and not receive any additional placements pending the completion of the license transfer process. The county or circuit from which the provider has moved should notify the receiving county/circuit of the provider’s change in address, and provide necessary information on current placements. Notification and the transfer of records should occur within one (1) week of the move. The sending county must also notify the receiving county of any weapons kept in the household. The receiving county or circuit should schedule a home visit within two (2) weeks of notification. A new Resource Home and Safety Checklist, CS-45, and updated home assessment must be completed by the receiving county. After the provider’s new home has been inspected and approved, re-licensure should be granted. The Administrative Hold should be removed from the Vendor Licensure, Approval and Renewal screen, and provider records updated to reflect the changes. If the resource family asks to change the age, sex or race of children to be considered for placement, update the appropriate screens in FACES, and request the issuance of a new license and approval certificate. Foster Family Home licenses are for a two year period. A licensee does not have a right to renewal of his or her license. Record the reassessment and recommendation information by following the instructions in section 6 Chapter 3 Subsection 1.3. Record all transactions of children presented for placement with a family and family’s acceptance or rejection of children including family’s reasons for decision. If a family has not had an alternative care placement for the last twelve (12) months or longer, the worker should discuss the reason why the family has not had a placement during this time period and the types of children in CD custody needing placement. A plan should be made to address the concerns of the foster parent(s) and or the Division. The foster parent(s) may attend additional training or may be utilized for respite care to address placement concerns. The Professional Family Development Plan (PFDP), CD-100, may be utilized for this process. Related Subject: Section 6 Chapter 2.5.1 Professional Family Development Plan (PFDP) The worker should begin the process for closing the license only after working with the foster parent(s) to reach an agreement on placing children in the home and discussion with the worker’s supervisor. The worker should complete the form Resource Home Adverse Action Report, CS-20. This will be considered a voluntary relinquishment of the license, unless licensing violations are present and impact the decision to close the license, and staff should mark other in the reason for the license relinquishment. Staff should explain that the foster home has not had placements for the last twelve (12) months or longer and that an agreement could not be reached for the placement of children in the home. If the foster family does not agree with closing the license, it should be placed on Administrative Hold until such time as the family will accept children or licensing closing or revocation can be completed. Once the Resource Home Adverse Action Report, CS-20, is completed and approved, the license is closed. The close reason used should be “04 – Vendor Resource Discontinued Service”. For relative foster care providers, the license may be closed once the foster youth begins a trial home visit. If the worker and supervisor feel the family is appropriate for consideration, they may also discuss with the provider the needs of the circuit for alternative care providers to determine if the provider is interested in becoming a licensed foster home. Section 6 Chapter 16 Subsection 5.1, Relative Foster Care Provider Choose to Become a Foster Home , provides instruction regarding a licensed relative foster home becoming a licensed foster home. The license should be closed if neither of these criteria is met. Obtain signature on Renewal Assessment indicating agreement; family retains one copy. Update the license status in FACES, and: Recommend issuance of license to resource providers for a two-year period, or Recommend issuance of license to relative family for a two-year period, or If not renewed, see license denial. Evaluate resource provider’s expressed interest of becoming resource providers in the Youth with Elevated Needs-Level A program by examining necessary qualifications, and characteristics: Enroll prospective Level A resource providers in specialized Level A training. Assess prospective Level A resource provider’s performance during specialized Level A training to determine if approval is indicated. Obtain and submit to DFAS Purchasing, the Level A resource provider’s signature on the Amendment to Provide Level A Foster Care, CM-3.

The preferred method of training delivery is instructor led. Instructor-led training is live, interactive training facilitated by an individual with training and expertise to deliver the training topic. Only 14 hours of non-instructor led in-service training may be approved per two (2) year licensure period. In-service training may be approved on a case by case basis for viewing a video, reading a book, or participating via a website. Other approved in-service training must be approved by the licensing worker and supervisor. Other approved in-service training must address some aspect of foster care. The resource provider must submit the Resource Family In-Service Training Request, CD-114, to the licensing worker to obtain approval. The licensing worker will submit the request to his/her supervisor for approval.   The approval should be obtained prior to the completion of training, if the resource provider is requesting mileage or babysitting reimbursement. The intent is that the training will address areas identified within the resource provider’s Professional Family Development Plan. The total amount of other approved in-service training accepted per licensing period is to be determined by the Regional Director based upon the availability of training and the training needs of the region. See Section 6 Chapter 2.6 Other Approved In-Service Training. c. Credit for educational/informational meetings (less than 8 hours) may be given, following the guide contained in2.5.3 paragraph Attachment D. The curriculum and number of hours must have local office approval. d. Arrange reimbursement of babysitting expenses ($2/Child/Hr), and mileage, if necessary, at current state rates through SAM II. Meals may be reimbursed at the per diem rate when the provider attends training in which they are in overnight status according to the Administrative Manual Chapter 7, Travel . The babysitting reimbursement ($2/child/hr) is to be applied to all children in the foster home, including the biological children of the resource provider(s). e. Special expenses (i.e., registration fees) may be approved by the Regional Office and paid through SAM II. f. Evaluate use of training experience with resource provider and training facilitators. g. Verify training hours completed and record required information on the Resource Parent Training screen in FACES.

A new CD-100 must be developed when the resource provider license is renewed. The CD-100 is reviewed quarterly and annually and should be updated as necessary. Refer to the STARS Resource Development Specialist’s Handbook, Step 11 This plan should be a joint process between the resource provider and worker that assesses the provider’s learning needs in an ongoing, proactive, and purposeful way. The Professional Family Development Plan has four components: assessment of the resource provider’s present level of competencies, their annual educational goals, methods of reaching those goals, and a way to determine if goals have been met. Performance Based Criteria have been established to help staff assess the present level of competencies for resource providers. These criteria are: Competency – Protecting and Nurturing Accepts placements of foster youth with abuse/neglect histories on an emergency basis with little notice and works to learn and understand the impact of that history on the youth’s emotions and behaviors.

The name Spaulding has been used interchangeably with the adoption portion of STARS. The following is an overview of the four pre-service sessions of STARS, Making the Commitment to Adoption: (Although the foster / adopt STARS curriculum allows only one session per week, the STARS, Adopt curriculum allows for more flexibility. Two sessions may be conducted in one week.) Session One: Exploring Expectations Trainers share the history and intent of the Making the Commitment to Adopt Curriculum as well as its objectives and assumptions about the training. The meaning of adoption, the process, and the important players in the process are discussed. The video “Before the Adoption Process Begins” is shown to acknowledge participants’ hopes and fears about the process and to lead to a discussion of empowering strategies. Participants explore their fantasies and expectations about the child or children that they wish to adopt. Session Two: Meeting the Needs of Waiting Children Participants will explore the reasons they feel they could adopt particular children and view the videotape, “The Children Who Wait”, to focus on the realities of adopting children who have been abused, neglected, abandoned, and have lived in the child welfare system. Particular attention is given to the issues of separation, loss, grief, attachment, and issues related to parenting the child who has been sexually abused. Session Three: Exploring Adoption Issues Using the Family Network Diagram, participants will explore family supports that may assist them in adopting children who have been abused, neglected or abandoned. The videotape, “Common Issues in Adoption,” addresses issues for which participants will develop strategies in their teams. Participants will be given information on predictable crisis periods in adoption and use their Family Network Diagrams and Genograms to explore their strengths, needs, and challenges in planning for adoption. Session Four: Making the Commitment This final session of the training focuses on helping participants look at resources, the commitment necessary for adoption, and tools to help parents get information to make a decision and commitment to adoption of a particular child. The participants will review their ecomaps, view the videotape, “Characteristics of Successful Adoptive Families,” and review a number of tools for getting information and to guide them in making their decisions about adopting. Participants will also be recognized for completing the training.

Foster/adopt parents must successfully complete 27 hours of training as well as the ten hours of assessment interwoven with the training. After demonstrating that they meet the required competencies, they then become professional foster/adoptive parents. Foster care providers wanting to adopt must take an additional 12 hours of STARS, Making the Commitment to Adoption (Spaulding) Pre-service training. Relative care providers are encouraged to complete the Spaulding training but are not required to complete this training. All STARS and Spaulding sessions are co-taught by a professional staff member of the agency/contracted provider and an experienced, currently licensed, professional foster/adoptive parent. The following is an overview of the nine STARS sessions, each of which is three hours in length. More than one session can occur a day, however, the nine sessions are to be taught over a minimum of three (3) dates: Session One: Connecting with STARS Session One connects participants with the Foster STARS/Adopt STARS program. Participants learn how the pre-service training provides the formative principles of assessment, selection, licensing, and approval. The competencies needed for successful fostering and adopting are reviewed in relation to the STARS pre-service sessions and the process of becoming a foster or adoptive family. Participants discover how to define family foster care and adoption. They learn how children and families get referred for services, and they explore challenges and rewards of fostering and adopting. Emphasis is on the participant’s understanding the requirement to provide normalcy for foster youth as defined in statue and regulation. Participants should be able to identify ways to make decisions for the foster youth to participate in age- and developmentally- appropriate activities by co-parenting with the foster youth’s parent(s) or guardian(s). Session One features a video that dramatically portrays fostering and adopting experiences. Session Two: Teamwork Toward Permanency This session introduces the importance of family relationships and the role families play in supporting the child’s identity, cultural identity, and self-esteem. Participants identify major tasks in planning for permanence, including ways to preserve connections and continuity through times of change. Participants are introduced to co-parenting with the foster youth’s parent(s) or guardian(s) for making decisions about activities the youth may participate in. Teamwork is presented as the best way to promote permanence for children and families. Trainees discover the unique role of foster parents and adoptive parents as members of a professional team. Emphasis is made regarding the resource parent’s responsibility to mentor and encourage the foster youth to actively participate in his/her case plan. Session Three: Meeting Developmental Needs: Attachment This session reviews the “basics” about child growth and development. It considers how important bonding and attachment are for growth and development. Session Three emphasizes ways that the team, and especially the foster or adoptive parent, may build positive attachments in order to meet developmental needs. Important information is provided regarding brain development and how allowing the foster youth to participate in age- and developmentally- appropriate activities impacts brain development. Session Four: Meeting Developmental Needs: Loss Separation and loss critically affect the child’s growth and development, particularly in family foster care and adoption. Participants learn the types of losses children encounter before entering foster care. They learn how placement can deepen the child’s sense of loss. Trainees review the stages of loss and consider how they influence the child’s feelings and behaviors. Loss is presented as a universal issue. Foster families and adoptive families consider how they have dealt with losses in their lives. They discuss how they might approach losses that come with fostering and adopting, and how they can be “loss managers” for children. Emphasis is made on providing normalcy for the foster youth to minimize loss of their normal activities and life experiences. Co-parenting strategies are explored to ensure decisions are made to allow for participation in age- and developmentally- appropriate activities. Session Five: Strengthening Family Relationships This session revisits how families promote identity, cultural identity, and self-esteem in children. Participants review the child welfare concept that children in placement should rejoin their families whenever possible. They discuss how the team can support reunification. The role of visiting in strengthening family relationships is explored. Concrete information explains how to plan for visits, how to prepare children for them, and how to handle reactions afterwards. The importance of families to children in the adoption process is discussed in terms of lifelong needs for identity and self-esteem. In this there is emphasis of how co-parenting helps not only for making good decisions for the foster youth’s activities, but also shows the value and importance of the foster youth’s family from which they have been removed. Session Six: Meeting Developmental Needs: Discipline This session focuses on the challenges of instilling discipline in children. The content and activities focus on protecting and nurturing children and meeting their developmental needs. Discipline is defined, the goals of effective discipline are identified, and the difference between discipline and punishment is illustrated. Trainees review the agency’s policy on discipline and discuss the negative effects of physical punishment. Participants learn about the knowledge, skills, and personal qualities needed to instill discipline. They explore the meaning of a child’s behavior and the factors that influence behavior. The session outlines the methods foster and adoptive parents, as team members, can use to meet the goals of effective discipline. Session Seven: Continuing Family Relationships This session looks at different ways the team can help to connect children to safe and nurturing relationships intended to last a lifetime. Permanency planning goals are outlined, starting with efforts to support families and reunite children with families and kin. Adoption, guardianship, and independent living activities are presented as other ways to promote lifelong connections when children cannot grow up with their families. Implementation of Reasonable and Prudent Parenting Standard is explored and explained throughout this session. Session Eight: Planning for Change How placement impacts the foster or adoptive family is the focus of this session. The first hours, days, and weeks of a child’s placement in the home are viewed practically. Trainees learn what to expect, what to ask the caseworker, and how to talk to the child. The importance of providing normalcy for the foster youth and co-parenting with the foster youth’s parent(s) or guardian(s) is stressed. Longer-term placement impact is also discussed, including how placement changes the foster or adoptive family. The notion that fostering and adopting carry risks is highlighted through a discussion of abuse allegations. Use of the team for support and focus is emphasized. Session Nine: Making an Informed Decision This session offers foster and adoptive parents a chance to learn first hand from experienced members of the foster care team. Panelists including foster parents, adoptive parents, caseworkers, and family members present their perspectives and answer participants’ questions. Participants will reflect on their growth and development regarding the pre-service competencies. They begin to make a final decision regarding their commitment to fostering or adopting.

Some children who have not been kept safe or cared for may not accept or understand the efforts to do so at first. Others are hungry for attention. The pre-service training will help the caretaker to understand a child’s feelings and reactions to separation and help the caretaker to deal with those feelings and reactions. Meeting Developmental Needs and Addressing Developmental Delays: For most of us, growing up is a natural, predictable development process. For example, infants who have the opportunity and encouragement to walk at the right stage of their development will learn how to walk. Many of the children who need foster families or adoptive families did not have the opportunity or encouragement to grow by learning how to do things at the “right” time in their development. They may be “behind” in some ways or “ahead” in others, compared with children of the same age who had their developmental needs met. The pre-service training helps prospective foster parents and adoptive parents understand the reasons for these developmental delays and differences and how to cope with them. Supporting Relationships Between Children and their Families: Birth family relationships include brothers, sisters, and other relatives, as well as parents. Children do not arrive at the door of a foster family or adoptive family without bringing some kind of personal history with them. Even infants who have never been held by their parents have a prenatal, birth, or hospital history. The memories, experiences and attachments children bring with them will vary, but they will come with the child. The pre-service training prepares the caretaker to understand the importance of a child’s history and how to deal with it. Connecting Children to Safe, Nurturing Relationships Intended to Last a Lifetime: The Division believes—and the law requires—that children are entitled to permanent, lifetime family relationships. Children’s Division (CD) works with the parents to correct problems so children can return home whenever possible. If the parents cannot or do not respond, the Division looks for another permanent family for the children. The different roles of foster parents and adoptive parents in providing a permanent family for a child will be explained in the training sessions. Working as a Member of a Professional Team: Whatever a child’s circumstances, needs or past experiences, the Division, foster parents, and adoptive parents work together for the child’s benefit. There are many troubled families and children who need help. The work that needs to be done is too much for any of us to do alone. One way these competencies are demonstrated is in the resource parent’s ability to apply the required Reasonable and Prudent Parenting Standards. Adoptive parents are expected to meet additional competencies: Knowing how adoptive families are unique; Understanding the importance of separation, loss, and grief in the adoption process; Understanding attachment and its importance in the adoption process; Anticipating and managing challenges as an adoptive family; and Making a lifelong commitment to a child.

"MO :: Section 6, Chapter 2 (Resource Provider Training- STARS (Specialized Training Assessment Resources and Support), subsection 3, – (STARS Training Objectives) :: 2.3.2 Competencies And Learning Objectives",Missouri,Rules,2023,"Adoption, Foster parent licensing, Permanency, Placement, Reunification",,,"Competencies take into account the person’s knowledge, attitude, and practice in performing the desired skills necessary to successfully parent the children in the custody of the Division. The competencies for Foster/Adopt STARS were developed by the “Developing Competencies Work Group” of the Illinois Foster PRIDE/Adopt PRIDE Steering Committee. They turned to the recommendations of the National Commission on Family Foster Care (convened by the Child Welfare League of America in collaboration with the National Foster Parent Association) as well as to other consultants. The result was the development of areas of responsibility or competency categories. The competency categories for foster parents include: Protecting and nurturing; Meeting developmental needs and addressing developmental delays; Supporting relationships between children and their birth families; Connecting children to safe, nurturing relationships intended to last a lifetime; and Working as a member of a professional team. One way these competencies are demonstrated is in the resource parent’s ability to apply the required Reasonable and Prudent Parenting Standards. Adoptive parent competency categories were developed through consultation with additional adoption experts and include: Knowing how adoptive families are unique; Understanding the importance of separation, loss and grief in the adoption process; Understanding attachment and its importance in the adoption process; Anticipating and managing challenges as an adoptive family; and Making a lifelong commitment to a child. From the competency categories, specific competencies were developed. Because some knowledge and skills are essential before children are placed with families and other knowledge and skills would be more appropriate for licensing, training competencies were organized into two groups – pre-service and core. Pre-service competencies are the grouping of knowledge and skills essential for foster parents and adoptive parents before a child is placed. Foster/Adopt STARS addresses competencies only at the pre-service level. For example, a pre-service training competency for foster parents is: “Foster parents know that regular visits and other types of contact can strengthen relationships between children and their birth families. “Core competencies are the knowledge and skills that are more effectively learned after a foster parent is licensed, and a child is placed. Core competencies typically are those which foster parents acquire in their first two years of experience. An example of a core competency is “Foster parents are able to support visits and contacts appropriate to each child/family situation.” Foster STARS addresses competencies at the core level. As foster parents become more experienced, they will need advanced and specialized competencies. Advanced competencies build on core competencies. For example, an advanced competency is “Foster parents are able to demonstrate parenting skills for the parents of children in their care.” Specialized competencies relate to a particular area of expertise, such as working with teen parents, caring for medically fragile children, or preparing youth for young adult living. The competencies were used to direct the development of all of the in-session and at-home learning objectives which are included in Foster/Adopt STARS. These learning objectives directed the development of all the material included in this training program. The Child Welfare League of America Standards for Family Foster Care (revised 1993) reference the competency categories presented here in Foster/Adopt STARS.

Additional meetings needed to assess the family should be held between the fifth and sixth sessions and again after the ninth Family Resource Development training session. The Family Assessment is completed utilizing the following tools: Genogram; Ecomap; Loss History Worksheet; Pathways Through the Grieving Process; and History and Current Functioning of Prospective Family. These tools will not be retained in the family’s case file. They are tools to utilize in completing the Assessment. It is at the final at-home consultation that the family and the Children’s Service Worker conclude their mutual assessment leading to a decision. The family must decide if they wish to foster or adopt. The worker must decide if this family has the skills, willingness, and resources to foster or adopt available children. The preceding tasks have allowed the worker and families to accumulate assessment information that must now be organized and assimilated into a clear and defensible decision. The worker must complete all of the following steps either before or during the final at-home consultation visit. The Children’s Service Worker must be sure that all required data has been collected before scheduling the final at-home consultation, including the following: Application; References; Health/Psychological Reports; Fingerprinting report; CA/N check of every state each household member age 17 and older has resided during the past five (5) years; Documentation of CaseNet review; Sexual Offender Registry by address; Family Care Safety Registry report; Documentation that family has attended all training sessions; Trainer’s observations of the family; and Foster Family Profile, CD-56. The Family Assessment is a composite of information collected through the collection of required data and interviewing the family members. Basically, the strengths and needs of the family are organized according to the five competency categories. Protecting and nurturing; Meeting developmental needs and addressing developmental delays; Supporting relationships between children and their birth families; Connecting children to safe, nurturing relationships intended to last a lifetime; and Working as a member of a professional team. Each statement made in the Family Assessment must be stated in behavioral terms and referenced. In other words, the Children’s Service Worker must list where, when, or in what document he/she read, observed, or been told about the strength or need. To prepare for writing the Family Assessment the Children’s Service Worker should review the following: Required forms listed above; Ecomap and genogram; Family Resource Development Connections (assignments completed between training sessions); Family Assessment Worksheet; and References. Having reviewed the pertinent documents listed above the Children’s Service Worker can now make a final decision to: Invite the family to select-in to the foster care or adoption program; Invite the family to select-in with a plan, i.e., correction of physical/tangible deficiency, i.e., smoke detector, furniture, etc.; Counsel the family out of providing family foster care or adoptive care. The family can decide to select-out and not participate as foster parents or adoptive parents. Prepare Family Assessment. More information regarding the Family Assessment is located in Section 6 Chapter 3, Resource Family Assessment and Licensing Process. Discuss recommendations with supervisor. A supervisor must approve the final decision and recommendation. The Children’s Service Worker should meet with the supervisor to share any borderline decisions and all decisions to counsel a family out of the program. Make phone call and send confirming letter to set up consultation. Begin at-home consultation by establishing an agenda. The agenda will vary with each family, but should generally include: Discussion of the family’s final decision regarding participation in the foster care or adoption program; Discussion of the Division’s final decision; Negotiation of a mutual decision; Review of the Family Assessment Summary; Introduction of the Professional Family Development Plan, CD-100, for families invited to select-in the family foster care program (see 2.5.1 for more information on the Professional Family Development Plan); Explanation of the next steps if the family disagrees with the Division’s decision to counsel the family out of the program. Plan for the meeting to complete the Professional Family Development Plan, CD-100.Initiate a collaborative process for discussing the Family Assessment. The Family Assessment is used as a tool to facilitate a process in which a mutual decision, not a compromise, is reached. The Children’s Service Worker presents the Assessment in order to work for agreement on areas in which the family is competent and areas that need support. The Children’s Service Worker relates all comments, positive and negative, to the strengths and needs identified with each of the five competencies. To create a collaborative environment the Children’s Service Worker should use interviewing and relationship techniques like: Making clear statements about strengths and needs documented in materials generated by the mutual assessment process or observed through previous meetings; Avoiding biased or inflammatory words, for example, “your answer was wrong” or “your discipline style is bad”; Reminding applicants of previous conversations where strengths and concerns were shared so that this final at-home consultation brings no surprises; Encouraging families to share their feelings and the results of their family discussion by using open ended questions and non-verbal displays of interest in what is being said; Communicating respect for the family, regardless of the decision made, by hearing their feelings and recognizing their interest and commitment; and Allowing an appropriate amount of anger from families disappointed with the final decision by not taking it personally or reacting unprofessionally. Present the Final Agency Decision; and present placement recommendation to the families who have been invited to select-in. The Children’s Service Worker and family should discuss the number, the age range, and the kinds of children they could most safely and successfully parent and the supports the Division would need to provide. This discussion should be based on the family’s strengths in the five competencies and supports they need from the Division. Begin the process for assessing learning needs and building a professional family development plan with the family invited to select-in; Schedule the consultation meeting to complete the family development plan and conclude consultation with next steps for foster families and adoptive families who have been selected-in. At the end of the Mutual Assessment process (training and family assessment) the family and Children’s Service Worker will decide whether to select-in or select-out the foster parent or adoptive parent applicant. When the Children’s Service Worker and family decide to select-in to the program, the worker should complete the following tasks: Notify family in person and in writing that they have been selected in; and Complete Vendor Licensure/Approval and Renewal screen in FACES. When the Children’s Service Worker and/or family decide to select-out, the worker should complete the following tasks: Recommend license denial using Resource Home Adverse Action Report, CS-20, through supervisory lines to the Regional Director; Include a summary of the licensing rules on which the decision is based; When an adverse action is CA/N related, submit a copy of the form CA/N 4; Submit a copy of the Family Assessment to Regional Director; and If the decision to deny a license is supported by the Regional Director, notify the applicant in person and with the Notification of Resource Home Adverse Action, CS-20a, sent via registered mail.

The process includes the applicant’s participation in nine pre-service training sessions, a series of meetings between the Children’s Service Worker and applicants, supplemental information obtained through meetings, the preparation program, references, and other licensing or approval checks. The selection of prospective foster parents and adoptive parents has been based on the concepts of: Assessing strengths and needs; Selecting families in; and Mutual assessment. Each prospective foster family or adoptive family should have been encouraged to participate in an open and honest assessment of their strengths in fostering or adopting, as well as their needs for support. Their strengths should be identified so they can be matched with the needs of a specific child to be placed. The needs should be identified so it can be determined if the Division can provide the supports required to meet those needs. As a result of this process, the final decision should be made to reflect the family’s ability and willingness to foster or adopt. The decision should be based on whether the prospective foster parent or adoptive parent: Has the potential for meeting the needs of the children and their families served by the Division; Has the personal commitment necessary to provide the required continuity of care throughout the child’s need for family foster care or adoption; Has sufficient flexibility to meet the needs of particular children as these change in the course of the child’s development; Is able to identify with the Division’s foster care and adoption program goals, work within its policies, share responsibility with the agency, and benefit from assistance and training opportunities; Is able to accept and support the child’s relationship with parents and kin; and Is able to work within the limitations of the Division and its supports available for foster families and adoptive families. Demonstrates the ability to apply the Reasonable and Prudent Parenting Standards including providing normalcy for the foster youth, co-parenting with the foster youth’s parent(s) or guardian(s), mentoring and encouraging the foster youth’s participation in his/her case planning, and understanding the responsibility of decision making for the foster youth’s participation in age- and developmentally-appropriate activities Chapter Memoranda History: (prior to 01-31-07) CD04-79 Memoranda History: CD07-15 , CD07-48 , CD07-54 , CD08-55 , CD09-88 , CD-105 , CD09-110 , CD12-84 , CD12-85 , CD14-09 , CD15-75 , CD16-65",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/mo-section-6-chapter-2-resource-provider-training-stars-specialized-training-assessment-10

During this meeting the Children’s Service Worker continues to provide the family with more specific information about what is involved in the job of being a foster parent or adoptive parent, the process by which the Division carries out the mutual assessment, and selection outcomes. The worker also begins more in-depth discussion with the family about their expectations and motivation for considering this job at this time. During this interview the worker may identify, through conversations or review of the application, issues that may raise preliminary questions about the family’s willingness or ability to become foster parents or adoptive parents. Depending on the nature of these issues, the worker may need to explore these issues with the family during this meeting. During this meeting the worker must explain the licensing requirements including the house assessment, the Foster Family Profile, CD-56, the Family Care Safety Registry, Fingerprinting, the child abuse/neglect screens, and criminal background checks with the family, and explain which are non-negotiable and which are subject to more subjective assessment criteria.

It can set the tone, both attitudinally and behaviorally, for future contacts. Many prospective foster parents and adoptive parents have given considerable thought to making this first call. Typically, it is not a spontaneous decision precipitated by viewing a recruitment poster or reading a newspaper story. Research indicates that individuals interested in fostering have thought about it for months and, sometimes, years. Individuals calling about adoption may have spent years of emotional and financial investment dealing with infertility issues. The Children’s Service Worker who accepts the inquiry from a prospective foster family or adoptive family should do the following: Introduce self by name and title; Respond to the caller’s stated interest; Educate the caller about the program; Use the inquiry worksheet to give and get information; Assess the caller’s knowledge of fostering and adopting to determine the information they and the Division need at this point in the licensing/certification process; Give information about the fostering or adoption program, addressing the questions/concerns raised by the caller including: Goals and challenges of the family foster care and adoption programs; Importance of foster parents and adoptive parents; Description of children needing foster families and adoptive families; Specific requirements for fostering or adopting; Competencies for fostering or adopting; Importance of participating in the resource family’s development process; and Steps in the licensing/certification process. Conclude inquiry call, clarifying next steps; Mail to caller a Foster/Adopt Home Assessment Application, CS-42; and Schedule an at-home consultation meeting within ten days of the inquiry. NOTE: Indicate a follow-up contact with callers who choose not to receive an information packet or schedule an at-home family consultation meeting at this time, but who appear to have the ability to foster or adopt.

"MO :: Section 6, Chapter 1 (Recruitment and Responding to Inquiries), Subsection 1 (Diligent Recruitment)",Missouri,Rules,2023,"Administrative process, Definitions, Foster parent recruiting",,,"The Multi-Ethnic Placement Act (1994) requires state agencies to make diligent efforts to recruit potential resource families that reflect the diversity of children in out of home care. Diligent recruitment refers to the systematic process of recruiting, retaining, and supporting resource parents who reflect the diversity of children who need placement. Diligent recruitment best practices include: Using a Customer Service model to positively communicate with families; Training and supporting resource parents in their role as caregivers; and Engaging in continuous quality improvement efforts by collecting and evaluating data. There are three types of recruitment efforts: General Recruitment broadcasts a call for foster and adoptive parents and builds public awareness and interest. This is done, for example, through advertising or by setting up an information table at a community event. Targeted Recruitment refers to efforts to find foster and adoptive parents who can meet particular needs of children in care. Agency administrative and demographic data are used to determine the characteristics of current foster and adoptive parents and of the children in care. Recruitment efforts are then targeted to potential resource parents who can meet the unique placement needs of certain children, such as sibling groups, older youth, or children with medical needs. Child-Specific Recruitment refers to efforts to recruit a foster or adoptive family for a specific child or sibling group. Each circuit is responsible for developing, implementing and evaluating an annual Resource Provider Recruitment Plan. Local partnerships established during the development of the Recruitment Plan ensure a well-rounded, locally specific approach that identifies community resources which can assist in meeting recruitment goals. Development of the Recruitment Plan should be facilitated by Children’s Division and include collaboration with: Foster Care Ambassadors; Existing foster, adoptive and respite providers; Court Partners; Local Contracted Agencies; Community Stakeholders; Faith-Based Groups; Local Businesses; Nonprofit Organizations; Universities; Any other community partners who have expressed an interest in supporting the agency’s efforts to recruit foster homes. The Circuit Manager, or their designee, will: Review and approve the annual Recruitment Plan before submitting it to Central Office by January 31 st of each year; Ensure all circuit team members are provided with and understand the Recruitment Plan; Encourage and provide opportunities for all circuit team members to participate in recruitment events; Share the Recruitment Plan and opportunities to participate in recruitment events with community stakeholders; Submit Recruitment events to DSS Communications for announcement.

Within three (3) months after receiving notice of the request, the court will receive a report from the child-placing agency stating if the biological parents were located and given the required information. Receive information from the child-placing agency if the biological parents were unable to be notified. Disclose identifying information if the biological parent has filed a release with the court or if the biological parent is found to be deceased, the court will disclose identifying information as to that biological parent to the adopted adult, or the adopted adult’s lineal descendants if the adopted adult is deceased, provided that the other biological parent is either: unknown; known but cannot be found and notified; deceased; has filed with the court an affidavit authorizing the release of information; or the adopted adult’s biological parent lost his or her parental rights through a nonconsensual termination of parental rights proceeding. Disclose identifying information pertaining exclusively to the biological sibling upon consent of that biological sibling. Not accept additional requests for the same information within one year from the end of the (3) three month period, provided that the biological parents were unable to be notified, unless a good cause is shown and leave of court is granted. Not accept additional requests within (3) three years of the time the biological parent fails or refuses to give consent authorizing the release of identifying information. The Children’s Service Worker will: Receive written notice from court that an adopted adult has made written request for release of identifying information about biological parents or siblings. If appropriate, report to court that the information requested was made by an adopted adult who made a similar request less than (1) one year from the date of current request and the biological parent/siblings could not be located at the time of the previous request. If appropriate, report to court that the adopted adult made a similar request within the last three (3) years and the biological parent/siblings refused to consent to the release of identifying information. NOTE: 453.121, RSMo, does not require another search until the above time frames have elapsed. Review appropriate Division records to gather identifying information on adopted adult, biological parents, adoptive parents, and biological siblings. Make reasonable efforts to notify the biological parents or the biological siblings of the request of adopted adult through a “confidential and personal” contact, which may include contact by telephone or face to face contact. Determine that either or both biological parents are deceased and document information source regarding this fact. Determine that a biological parent is unknown, after review and search of adoption records and other materials, and document the information source regarding this information. Determine that a biological parent is known, but cannot be located, and document the attempts to locate the specific biological parent. Determine that the biological parent has previously filed an affidavit with the court, if the biological parent indicates this has been done, and obtain identifying information about the court receiving the affidavit. Request assistance from another county office or state if biological parent is located out of state. Inform person contacted of need for confidential contact. Determine that either or both biological parents lost his or her parental rights through a nonconsensual termination of parental rights proceeding. Inform the biological parent(s) at the time of notification of the following: A report to the court will be made which includes the following information: The nature of the identifying information contained in Division records. The nature of the non-identifying information contained in Division records. The date of the request of the adopted adult. That the Division has informed the biological parent of the necessity to file an affidavit with the court permitting the release of identifying information. That the Division informed the biological parent of the effect of a failure to file an affidavit consenting to the release of identifying information. The necessity to file an affidavit with the court which granted the adoption stating that the identifying information should be disclosed. That identifying information will not be released to the adopted adult if the affidavit is not filed with the court. The identifying information will be released only by the court to the adopted adult. File report with the court at the end of three (3) months, or as soon as information is secured, which includes the following information: That each biological parent was/was not located. The nature of the identifying information requested. The date of the request of the adopted adult. The fact that the biological parent was informed of the right to file an affidavit with the court stating that identifying information should be disclosed. The fact that the biological parent was informed of the effect of a failure to file the affidavit. NOTE: “Effect of a failure” is that identifying information cannot be released to the adopted adult.

Staff should also meet with the family’s biological/adopted children separate from the parents to discuss their feelings on alternative care placements and sharing their household. An overview of the Foster Family Profile, CD-56 and the types of placements and children desired, as well as the strengths and needs identified in the assessment and during the initial contact with the family should be included. The date the vendor was opened in the system should also be noted. The pre-service training class work/homework documents are to be returned to the resource provider(s) once their license has been approved and opened in the system. The next recording should be to document the discussion of and agreement to the Professional Family Development Plan, CD-100. Within thirty (30) days of the family becoming licensed, the worker is to schedule a meeting to develop a Professional Family Development Plan CD100 with the resource family. Any placements made, contacts with the family, staff concerns with the family, and trainings attended should be documented by the licensing worker. A summary should be completed at the end of each quarter that addresses any concerns or issues noted during the quarter, number and types of placements made, reasons for any moves out of the household, and training attended. Subsequent Recording Subsequent recording should document the date of the licensing worker’s home visits (which must occur a minimum of once each quarter) and contact with the family’s biological/adopted children. The worker should also document discussion of any licensing issues, placement concerns, progress and/or changes to the Foster Family Profile, CD-56, and any other issues/concerns noted by the Children’s Service Worker. Ongoing documentation should include anytime the home is considered for placement and why the home was chosen or not, and the date any children moved from the household and why. The quarterly summary is the CD-118. The quarterly summary should include the number and types of current placements, changes in household composition (i.e. divorce, death, illnesses, adoptions, births, etc.), and changes to the physical environment (moves, additions, remodels, etc). There should also be a discussion of any hotline reports, incidents, issues or concerns involving the foster, relative or kinship family and any action taken. It should also be noted if no action was taken and why. Quarterly visits are conversational allowing for the sharing of concerns as well as accomplishments and development of a mutual relationship of trust. The visits are to be used as a prompt to have meaningful conversations about pertinent issues and assure compliance with licensing requirements. The conversation must include how the Reasonable and Prudent Parenting Standard is being applied in the home. The CD-100 should be reviewed and updated annually and at each license renewal and should be documented in the case record. Yearly updates should include the families’ progress in the CD-100 and with documentation of any changes made to the plan. A summary of the family’s performance should also include whether the family is meeting the core competencies, including the Reasonable and Prudent Parenting Standard, if there are areas of need identified for the family, and what strengths have the family demonstrated. The CS-45, Resource Home and Safety Check list, is completed at the initial walkthrough and at license renewal. Documentation of Contact with Children in Division Custody Contact with all household members should be documented. However, only initials should be utilized when making reference to children in Division custody. This is true of all current and previous placements in the household. Resource family records are not confidential and may be requested by the public but information on children in Children’s Division custody is confidential. Using initials only will help to maintain confidentiality of the children in Division custody. A list, Placement Report for Resource Home Record, CD-104 should be maintained in the front of the file with the names, placement and removal dates of all children in the resource family home. This form will be removed prior to the records being made public. Foster Family Profile A photograph of the resource provider’s family and the Foster Family Profile, CD-56, is to be placed under separate cover sheet and placed in the front of the resource provider’s record. The Foster Family Profile is to be accessible to the Family Support Team in making its determination and selection of placements for children. A new CD-56 is to be completed at the time of re-licensure or when there are changes in the household composition that impact the information gathered on the Foster Family Profile. The most recent CD-56 is to be kept in the front of the resource provider’s record. The obsolete CD-56 should be placed in the Family Assessment Section of the resource provider’s file, with a notation on the front page of the profile identifying it as obsolete. Documentation of Criminal History Staff should not list specifics in the narrative section of the file when documenting criminal history. The narrative should simply reflect one of the following: Fingerprint based criminal background check results meet eligibility requirements; Fingerprint based criminal background check results do not meet eligibility requirements; or Fingerprint based criminal background check results require further review to determine if applicant is precluded from licensure. Specific criminal history information may be included in the Resource Home Adverse Action Report, CS-20, when it is the basis for denial or revocation.At the time of re-approval or re-licensure, staff should destroy the criminal history report obtained for the last approval/licensure period. The previous record is obsolete and no longer required to be maintained in the record. Staff should document that the report was destroyed. This should be done only after receipt of the new criminal history report. Staff should not maintain any electronic copies of criminal history records. Closing Summary There should be a summary completed whenever a resource home is closed. For those closed voluntarily, the narrative should include why the family chose to close their license as well as any concerns or strengths of the family noted by staff. For those closed due to revocation, the licensing issue that led to the revocation and any other concerns should be documented clearly. The date of the exit interview and the discussion with the family should be documented in the closing summary. Provide a copy of the Resource Family Exit Interview, CD-112, for the resource provider to complete. The CD-112 shall be placed in the forms section of the case record.

If a child does not have a listed impairment, SSA will determine if a child’s condition would equate a “listed impairment” or would cause marked and severe functional limitations. This means that a child does not have to have one of the listed impairments in order to be eligible for SSI. The listings are intended to be used as a tool in determining if a child has a listed impairment or a comparable impairment that causes the child to have marked and severe functional limitations in everyday activities. Social Security Specialists have been provided with a copy of the detailed listing of impairments, which contains the medical criteria used by SSA to evaluate each of the listed impairments: Listed Childhood Impairments: Growth Impairment; Musculoskeletal: Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis; Musculoskeletal Function Deficit; Disorders of the Spine; and/or Chronic Osteomyelitis. Special Sence Organs: Blindness/Impairments of Central Visual Acuity; and/or Hearing Impairment. Respiratory: Bronchial Asthma; and/or Cystic Fibrosis. Cardiovascular: Chronic Congestive Failure; Hypertensive Cardiovascular Disease; Cyanotic Congenital Heart Disease; Cardiac Arrhythmia; Chronic Rheumatic Fever/ Rheumatic Heart Disease; Congenital heart disease; Valvular heart disease; Cardiomyopathies; Cardiac transplantation; Hyperlipidemia; and/or Kawasaki syndrome. Digestive: Esophageal Obstruction; Chronic Liver Disease; Chronic Inflammatory Bowel Disease; and/or Malnutrition. Genito-Urinary: Chronic Renal Disease; and/or Nephritic Syndrome. Hemic and Lymphatic: Hemolytic Anemia; Chronic Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura; Sickle Cell Disease; Inherited Coagulation Disorders; and/or Acute Leukemia. Endocrine: Hyperthyroidism; Hypothyroidism; Hyperparathyroidism; Hypoparathyroidism; Diabetes Insipidus; Hyper function of the Adrenal Cortex; Adrenal Cortical Insufficiency; Juvenile Diabetes Mellitus; Latrogenic Hyper Corticoid State; Pituitary Dwarfism; Adrenogenital Syndrome; Hypoglycemia; and/or Gonadal Dysgenesis. Multiple Body Systems: Down Syndrome; Multiple Body Dysfunction; Catastrophic Congenital Abnormalities; and/or Immune Deficiency Disorder. Neurological: Motor Seizure Disorders; Brain Tumors; Motor Dysfunction due to Neurological Disorder; Cerebral Palsy; Meningomyocele; and/or Communication Impairment Associated with Neurological Disorder. Mental Disorders: Mood Disorders:  Characterized by a disturbance of mood (referring to a prolonged emotion that colors the whole psychic life, generally involving either depression or elation), accompanied by a full or partial manic or depressive syndrome. Mental Retardation:  Characterized by significantly sub-average general intellectual functioning with deficits in adaptive functioning. Anxiety Disorders:  In these disorders, anxiety is either the predominant disturbance or is experienced if the individual attempts to master symptoms, i.e., confronting the dreaded object or situation in a phobic disorder, attempting to go to school in a separation anxiety disorder, resisting the obsessions or compulsions in an obsessive compulsive disorder, or confronting strangers or peers in avoidant disorders. Somatoform, Eating, and Tic Disorders:  Manifested by physical symptoms for which there are no demonstrable organic findings or known physiologic mechanisms; or eating or tic disorders with physical manifestations. Personality Disorders:  Manifested by pervasive, inflexible, and maladaptive personality traits, which are typical of the child’s long-term functioning and not limited to discrete episodes of illness. Psychoactive Substances Dependence Disorders:  Manifested by a cluster of cognitive, behavioral, and physiologic symptoms that indicate impaired control of psychoactive substance use with continued use of the substance despite adverse consequences. Autistic Disorder and other Pervasive Developmental Disorders:  Characterized by qualitative deficits in the development of reciprocal social interaction, in the development of verbal and nonverbal communication skills, and in imaginative activity. Often there is a markedly restricted repertoire of activities and interests, which frequently are stereotyped and repetitive. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder:  Manifested by developmentally inappropriate degrees of inattention, impulsiveness, and hyperactivity. Developmental and Emotional Disorders of Newborn and Younger Infants:  Developmental or emotional disorders of infancy are evidenced by a deficit or lag in the areas of motor, cognitive/communicative, or social functioning. These disorders may be related either to organic or to functional factors or to a combination of these factors. Organic mental disorders:  Characterized by abnormalities in perception, cognition, affect, or behavior associated with dysfunction of the brain. Schizophrenic, delusional (paranoid), schizoaffective, and other psychotic disorders:  Characterized by a marked disturbance of thinking, feeling, and behavior, with deterioration from a previous level of functioning or failure to achieve the expected level of social functioning. Neoplastic: Lymphoreticular Malignant Neoplasm’s ; Malignant Solid Tumors; and/or Neurobla. Immune: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus; Systemic Vasculitis; Systemic sclerosis and scleroderma; Polymyositis or dermatomyositis; Undifferentiated connective tissue disorder; Congenital immune deficiency disease; and/or Human immunodeficiency disease (HIV). General Medical Information SSA maintains that a child is a person who has not attained age 18. For purposes of SSI eligibility:  A child is considered disabled if he or she has any Medically Determinable Physical or Mental impairment(s) which is expected to last 12 continuous months or result in death and causes marked and severe functional limitations. Developmental Assessment Guides Staff must provide information that will support a claim of an impairment that causes a child to function with marked and severe limitations. Information provided to SSA should include a child’s school records, medical records and/or medical sources, psychological reports and observations of the Children’s Services Worker, resource providers, teachers, or other persons who have first hand knowledge of a child’s ability to function in daily activities. In most cases the resource provider or other alternative care provider would best know how a child functions in his/her daily activities. The severity of the impairment is measured according to the functional limitations imposed by the impairment. The functional areas considered are:  motor function, cognitive/communicative function, social function, personal function, and concentration, persistence or pace. The range of these functions varies at different stages of the child’s maturation. General Eligibility Requirements: Non-Medical Eligibility Requirements: Although a child may meet the definition of disability, the income and resources they have determine if they meet the non-medical limitations: Resources – A child may be able to qualify for SSI if his/her resources do not exceed $2000.00. Resources are things that the child has ownership rights or access to, such as the following: Bank Accounts; Cash; Property; and Stocks and Bonds. Income – The amount of income the child can have each month and still qualify for SSI benefits is revised January 1 of each year. SSA does not count all types of income in determining eligibility for SSI. For example, SSA does not count: Food Stamps; Food, shelter, or clothing received from private, non-profit organizations; The first $20.00 of most income received in a month; and Assistance based on need funded by State or local governments. This List is Not All Inclusive, But can Serve as a Basis for Screening for Potential Eligibility. Screening Guide Use this screening guide after consideration of the SSI income and resource requirements: Premature Infants (up to 1 year old): Premature Infants (less than 37 weeks gestation) who weigh less than 1200 grams (about 2 pounds 10 ounces) at birth will be considered disabled until the attainment of the chronological age of 12 months. Until the chronological age of 12 months, a premature infant who weighs at least 1200 grams but less than 2000 grams (about 4 pounds 6 ounces) at birth and is at least 4 weeks small, for gestational age, will be considered disabled. NOTE:  Most of the children who were born drug affected will be premature or have low birth weight and should be placed in Priority #1. All Children: Step One: Does the child have a medically determinable Mental or Physical impairment? If “No”, stop. NOTE:  This child’s eligibility is doubtful and should be placed in Priority #3. If “Yes”, go to Step 2. Step Two: Does the child’s impairment or combination of impairments cause marked and severe functional limitations? If “No”, stop. NOTE:  This child’s eligibility is doubtful and should be placed in Priority #3. If “Yes”, the child should be given the appropriate priority and referred to the Social Security Specialist, via Form CS-IV-E/FFP-1 or, when applicable, Title IV-E/FFP Referral, Form CS-IV-/FFP-2, Title IV-E, FFP Redetermination. NOTE:  Refer questionable situations to the Social Security Specialist, via the CS-IV-E/FFP-1 or, when applicable, the CS-IV-E/FFP-2, for a formal SSA disability determination. Referral Priority Guidelines The following guidelines will assist staff in prioritizing SSI referrals: Priority 1: All HDN or Title XIX FFP children who are in residential care or group care. All children in foster care,Youth with Elevated Needs homes, Medical Foster Care (MFC), or other placements, and who have a history of psychological, educational problems, or medical or physical/mental handicaps, where we have documentation that the child is not functioning at an age-appropriate level. Newborns who were born drug affected, premature or had a low birth weight. Priority 2: Children who may have a history of psychological, educational or physical problems. The Children’s Service Worker will need to collect comprehensive documentation. Children recently placed in our custody who appear to have a disabling condition that has not been documented. The Children’s Service Worker will need to collect documentation. Priority 3: Children with little or no known psychological, educational or physical deficiencies. Priority 4: Children who are currently receiving SSI benefits. Evidence Needed When Filing The following is a list of information and evidence needed to make a disability determination. If this information is available at the time of referral to the Social Security Specialist, (via the CS-IV-E/FFP-1 or, when applicable, the CS-IV-E/FFP-2 for Title XVI (SSI) Disabled Children’s benefits) it will significantly help the Disability Determination Section (DSS) in making a timely decision. General information needed: Name, address, and telephone number for each treatment physician (including psychologists) and dates of treatment. Name and address of each hospital, clinic, other medical institution, or health care facility where the child has been treated for the impairment(s). Please include any patient or clinic numbers. Name and address of the school the child is currently attending and the name of the teacher or teachers. If the child has changed schools, please furnish this same information for the last school attended. NOTE:  When the child has been in Children’s Division (CD) custody less than 12 months, it may be necessary for SSA to contact the birth parent(s) to gather historical information. Information which may be in the case file: Copies and summaries of medical records from hospital, clinics, other medical institutions, and health care facilities. Reports from Children’s Service Workers about the child’s impairment(s) or level of functioning. Statements from the child, guardian, caregiver, or others about the child’s impairment(s) and the effect on the child’s functioning. NOTE:  resource providers’ observations could assist SSA in developing a pattern of low functioning. Statements from other practitioners (i.e. nurse practitioners, physicians’ assistants, chiropractors) and from therapists (including physical, occupational or speech and language therapists). Information from educational agencies and personnel (i.e., school teachers, school psychologists, school counselors, preschools, early intervention teams, developmental centers, and child care centers. NOTE:  Any information relating to educational or behavior problems in the school setting are important. Any other information from the file which furnishes information about the child’s impairment(s) and the effects on the child’s ability to function without limitations.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/mo-section-4-chapter-12-financial-considerations-subsection-6-supplemental-security-income-0

Plan with out-of-home care providers and other appropriate team members to ensure that all children in out-of-home care shall receive education on sexual development, appropriate to their age, life experiences, and living conditions. This information should include information on sexuality and venereal diseases. Children in out-of-home care are eligible for MM/DSP (MO HealthNet, Title XIX).

Emergency and Extraordinary Medical/Dental Care When children are in CD custody their birth parents still have certain rights. One of these rights is to give permission for extraordinary medical/dental care.  Whenever possible, the worker should seek parental permission for these medical/dental services.  If this is not possible, the Children’s Services Worker shall seek approval for the medical/dental services from the juvenile court.  Then the Children’s Service Worker shall seek approval through their Area Office. Children’s Treatment Services Children in Out-of-home care are eligible for a variety of children’s treatment services, medical and psychiatric services covered by a contract with CD. If a child in out-of-home care is in need of these services, the worker should consult the listing of CD approved contractual treatment providers who offer the service and make the appropriate referral.  Payment will be made at MO HealthNet or state contracted rates. NOTE: For medical examinations, the HCY referral should be done first.  CTS would be used if an HCY physician is not available. Missouri Medical/Dental Services Program (MM/DSP) (Also known as Title XIX or MO HealthNet) Children in out-of-home care are eligible for MM/DSP if they are in the custody of CD. Guidelines established by the MO HealthNet Division (MHD) determine which medical services are eligible for payment and at what rate.  Staff should use this program whenever possible to provide a child with medical care.  HCY services are available through this program. Section 6036 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 section 1903 of the Social Security Act requires that states obtain satisfactory documentation of citizenship in order to receive MO HealthNet benefits. States must obtain documents establishing identity and citizenship for new applicants and recipients for all categories of MO HealthNet. For all children coming into Division custody after July 1, 2006, and for all eligibility re-determinations, the Children’s Service Workers will provide the Eligibility Specialist with a copy of the court order and if available documentation of identity and citizenship, preferably a copy of the child’s birth certificate. (Original birth certificates will remain in the child’s file.) If documentation is not available the Children’s Service Worker will begin the process of collecting the appropriate documentation immediately and when obtained forward copies to the Eligibility Specialist. The Children’s Service worker will presume all children coming into care as eligible for MO HealthNet, however if the worker is not able to collect the proper documentation, it will be the responsibility of the Eligibility Specialist to make that determination and put the proper coding on the SS-61. The Eligibility Specialist may request the Children’s Service Worker to collect particular documentation during the certification or re-certification process. The citizenship and identification verification process is also applicable for children eligible for MO HealthNet who were referred to the Division for adoption subsidy by outside adoption agencies. Documents Used to Verify both U.S. Citizenship and Identity: U.S. Passport. The passport does not have to be currently valid to be accepted as long as it was originally issued without limitation; Certificate of Naturalization (N-550 or N-570); or Certificate of Citizenship (N-560 or N-561). Documents Verifying Citizenship Only: U.S. Birth Certificate or IBTH. IBTH is available for individuals born in the State of Missouri. IBTH will display birth records for those born in Missouri back to 1920. IBTH can be viewed to verify citizenship. When using this information, document in the case record the date viewed and the information verified. Do not print and file the IBTH in the case record. A Certification of Report of Birth (DS-1350). Consular Report of Birth Abroad (FS-240). Certificate of Birth Abroad (FS-545). U.S. Citizen ID card (I-197 or I-179). American Indian Card (I-872). Northern Mariana Identification Card (I-873). Final adoption decree which shows a U.S. place of birth. Official Military Record of Service which shows a U.S. place of birth. Hospital record that meets the following criteria: Created on hospital letterhead; Established at the time of the person’s birth; Created at least five years before the initial application date; and Indicates a U.S. place of birth. NOTE: For children under 5 years of age, the document must have been created near the time of birth. Life or health insurance record, created at least five years before the initial application date, showing a U.S. place of birth. U.S. State Vital Statistics official notification of birth registration. Statement signed by the physician or midwife who was in attendance at time of birth. Institutional admission papers from a nursing home, skilled nursing care facility, or other institution that were created at least five years prior to the initial application date and indicates a U.S. place of birth. Medical (clinic, doctor, or hospital) record that was created at least five years before the initial application date and indicates a U.S. place of birth. An immunization record is not considered a medical record for purposes of establishing citizenship. For children under 5 years of age, the document must have been created near the time of birth. NOTE: When using a document from the above to verify citizenship, a second document must be obtained from the following list to verify identity. When documents verifying both citizenship and identity are not available, a document may be used to verify citizenship accompanied by a second document that verifies identity. Sources of documentation of identity for children under age 16 are as follows: School record that shows the date and place of birth and parent(s) name. School records may include nursery or child care records. Clinic, doctor, or hospital record showing date of birth. Court orders identifying individual. Identity may be verified through our database if child received coverage as a Newborn. If none of the above documents are available, an affidavit by the parent or guardian may be used. Verification of Citizenship and Identity for Newborns Citizenship and identity are not required to be verified to add children as newborns as these children are deemed to have applied for and been found eligible to receive MO HealthNet benefits as a result of their mothers being active recipients at the time of birth. Obtaining Records from the Bureau of Vital Records The Bureau of Vital Records, within the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, has certificates of Missouri births, deaths and fetal death reports. BVR screens frequently utilized by staff include IBTH and IDTH.  In Missouri these records are not open to the public and each screen includes the wording: “Information on this screen is confidential and shall be used for official state purposes only”. This information is for inquiry only and should not be printed, faxed or copied. Certified copies of Missouri vital records of birth and death on behalf of children in out-of-home care can be obtained by submitting form CD-127 to Central Office as directed on the form. Amendments to a Missouri vital record on behalf of a child in out-of-home care should be requested through Central Office. The CD-127, as well as a certified court order – with raised seal – clearly describing what changes need to be made to the record should be mailed to Central Office.  Central Office will review, log, and send to Vital Records for processing. Requests for out-of-state birth or death certificates must be made to the holding state’s vital records office. Staff should complete that State’s vital records application form via an on-line search.  The application, any other documents (court order, photo id, cover letter, etc) required by that state, and a SAMII Payment Request Form should be forwarded to the DFAS Payments/Accounts Payable Unit.  DFAS will process payment for the vital record and send the payment and application to the holding state. Bureau for Children with Special Health Care Needs (BCSHCN) This bureau provides some medical services not covered by MO HealthNet. To make a referral for a child, the Children’s Service Worker should make sure that the needed medical services are not covered by MO HealthNet. When it has been determined that the needed medical services are not covered by MO HealthNet, the Children’s Services Worker may make a referral to the appropriate regional bureau office. Department of Mental Health The Department of Mental Health (DMH) provides prevention, evaluation, and treatment services to eligible adults and children in out-of-home care who are in need of DMH services may be referred to the appropriate DMH division to meet the needs of the child. Division of Behavioral Health (DBH): Provides, among others, outpatient community-based services, targeted case management, day treatment, treatment family home programs, and community psychiatric rehabilitation (CPRP).  DBH also assures the availability of substance use prevention, treatment, and recovery support services. Division of Developmental Disabilities (DD): Supportive services for individuals with developmental disabilities such as intellectual disabilities, cerebral palsy, head injuries, autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy, and certain learning disabilities.  Such conditions must have occurred before age 22 and be considered lifelong in duration. More information about DD, including referrals, must be made directly to DMH/DD. For more information on services and referral procedures for DBH, contact the appropriate Community Mental Health Center servicing the county of interest.  These DMH affiliates are responsible for determining eligibility and providing the services.  Contact information for regional Community Behavioral Health Centers can be found on the DMH website. Private Psychiatric Hospital Placement Children in Out-of-home care who are eligible for private psychiatric hospital care. These facilities provide services including medical treatment, psychiatric/psychological counseling and testing, nursing care, educational services, social work services, recreation services and occupational therapy.  The Children’s Services Worker should contact the hospital directly to arrange for the child’s admission.  Cost for the child’s care is paid by MO HealthNet for a number of days as prescribed by the Professional Activity Study (PAS). Payment for days beyond the PAS days may be paid with Area Office approval. The psychiatric facility should request prior approval of the extension through the MO HealthNet Division (MHD) for extended MO HealthNet payment of the service.  If MHD denies, the psychiatric facility should submit the request for payment to the County Office.  Such a request is forwarded through normal supervisory channels to the Program Development System Unit (PDSU).  The worker should consult the listing of CD contracted services and use these facilities, if treatment is anticipated to exceed the number of PAS days. Medical Foster Care Children in Out-of-home care who require special care directly attributable to a medical/physical/developmental disability may be eligible to receive medical foster care. If a child is in need of such special care, refer the child through local procedure. Medical Services Authorization Information Letter The Children’s Division (CD) participates in the development and implementation of coordinated social and health services which includes preventive, maintenance, and long-term medical and mental health care for children placed in the legal custody of the Children’s Division. Services for foster youth medical and mental health needs should be provided by service providers who are enrolled in the state Medicaid plan, MO HealthNet. If a provider who is not enrolled with MO HealthNet is used for a foster youth, the resource provider may have to pay for the services out-of-pocket and not be reimbursed.  If the resource parent is reimbursed, it will be at the Medicaid rate. Any reimbursement to the resource provider will be from Children’s Treatment Services (CTS) funds. In the event that a resource parent uses a medical or mental health provider who is not enrolled with MO HealthNet or a MO HealthNet Managed Care Plan the CD-27 must be presented prior to the foster youth receiving services. When a resource parent pays for a medical or mental health service out-of-pocket, the receipt for services must be submitted to the foster youth’s case manager immediately. When a resource parent receives an invoice for medical or mental health services for a foster placement in their home, the invoice must be submitted to the foster youth’s case manager immediately.

"MO :: Section 4, Chapter 4 (Working with Children), Subsection 3 – Medical and Behavioral Health Planning :: 4.3.3 Informed Consent",Missouri,Rules,"2023, 2022, 2021","Services while in care - Medical, Services while in care - Mental Health",,,"While children are in the custody of Children’s Division (CD), the case manager shall be primarily responsible for granting informed consent for their care, unless an alternative consenter has been appointed by the Court. Resource providers may continue to provide informed consent for routine or standard treatment.  This policy outlines steps for consultation and communication when managing routine and non-routine treatment decisions.  Case managers should refer to this section to determine next steps after a health care provider recommends a specific treatment (e.g. medication, service, or procedure) for a child in CD’s custody. To ensure that those authorized to give informed consent fully understand the role/responsibilities of granting informed consent, including considering the use of non-pharmacological interventions (options that do not involve medicines), CD has developed training to assist consenters. As described below, resource providers may only consent to routine treatments/services. Case managers may consent to routine and non-routine treatments/services. Case managers and resource providers must successfully complete Informed Consent and Psychotropic Medication Management Training before becoming consenters. NOTE: This policy does not apply to cases where the youth is in the legal custody of a third party (LS-3). To ensure that consent is informed and legally valid, the case manager should collect from the prescriber information about the following factors, and understand and consider their impact upon the child: Nature and purpose of recommended treatment; what are the prescriber’s reasons for this particular recommended course of treatment; and Diagnosis: what is the specific condition to be treated? For medication recommendations, also consider: Dosages of any medications and the beneficial effects on the condition expected from the medications; Whether recommendation is for “off-label” use.  “Off-label” means that if a drug has been approved for one use, dosage or age group, prescribers may choose to use this same drug for other reasons, if they believe it may be helpful; Possible side-effects, including probable clinically significant side effects and risks associated with the medications; Required follow-up or monitoring; Availability of alternatives, including generally accepted alternative medications and/or non-pharmacological interventions, if any; and Prognosis without an intervention, including the probable physical and/or behavioral health consequences of not consenting to the recommended treatment, including medication. The case manager must always complete the CD-275 Informed Consent for Psychotropic Medication and document the informed consent decision in the medical information screen in FACES. The case manager will complete the date informed consent was given for psychotropic medication, by whom informed consent was provided, and the comments field listed under medication. This field should be utilized to document overall comments regarding medical care for the child and information about a secondary or mandatory review that was completed. Child assent can be documented in this field as well. Guidelines for Informed Consent Decisions Health care treatment decisions for children, including the use of medication, are always important and should be made thoughtfully, considering relevant information available. Just as non-pharmacological interventions should be considered for any condition, pharmaceutical intervention for behavioral health issues should never be the first nor sole intervention for children in CD custody. When a case manager is deciding whether to consent to routine or non-routine treatment, in addition to the factors listed above, they should also consider: Child and Family medical history, as documented in the CD-264, CW-103 and  CD-265; Age of the child; Child’s and parent(s)’ expressed preference; Assessment by the health care provider; Whether a consultation with the statewide clinical consultant would be helpful or otherwise required by policy; and Plan for safe storage of medications. Informed Consent for Routine Treatment As defined above, routine (standard) medical treatment includes treatment for ordinary illnesses and on-going treatment for chronic conditions.  Per Missouri law, a minor may consent to administration of birth control. The case manager or the resource provider (consenter) may consent to any routine (standard) medical treatment for a youth in Children’s Division’s custody.  As noted in this chapter, the case manager or resource provider should attempt to involve the parent in routine treatment by offering invitations to appointments and providing updates about the child’s health status. Documentation of the informed consent decision for routine treatment is always required and shall be in FACES and the medical record within the child’s file. The resource providers’ documentation should be contained in the Monthly Medical Log (CD-265) and the event shared with the case manager.  The consenter may be asked by the health care provider to document their consent or refusal of treatment on a form offered by the provider.  If this occurs, the consenter should request a written copy of the consent documentation from the health care provider to be saved in the child’s medical record. Informed Consent for Non-Routine Treatment, including Behavioral Health Services and Psychotropic Medication As defined above, non-routine medical treatment includes any health intervention that is not considered routine (standard) or extraordinary care. Only CD and contracted case management staff may grant informed consent for non-routine treatment; resource providers are not authorized to consent for non-routine treatment, excepted in the limited circumstances described below. Every informed consent decision shall include engagement with the parent(s). Contact with the parent(s) shall include a conversation about the recommended treatment and/or procedure, such as diagnosis, purpose, names and dosages of any medications, possible side-effects, required follow-up or monitoring, availability of alternatives, and prognosis without an intervention. The informed consent decision process shall be documented in the case record. Some children may need medication to cope with the trauma of abuse, neglect or separation. Other children may need medication to help treat behavioral health disorders that they inherited or developed, such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), severe depression, or psychosis. Informed consent for a specific psychotropic medication may not be used to imply informed consent for another medication.  Thus, the case manager should follow this process each time an additional medication is recommended. Psychotropic Medication – Initiation and Monitoring A case manager shall not consent to the use of psychotropic medications without first having sought alternative interventions to aid the child, resource provider or parents. Those may include, but are not limited to therapy, skills building, parenting assistance or family therapy. Every child shall have a behavioral health assessment, with a DSM-based diagnosis, documented in the child’s case record prior to being prescribed a psychotropic medication. In the case of a child who comes into CD legal custody with an existing psychotropic medication prescription, CD may continue to administer such medication until the necessary evaluations have been made. Every child prescribed a psychotropic medication shall have medical examinations as indicated by the current “Bright Futures /American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Recommendations for Preventive Pediatric Health Care,” or “periodicity schedule,” or more frequently if recommended by the prescriber. Every child prescribed a psychotropic medication for ongoing use (more than a single dose) shall have, documented in the child’s case record, monitoring appointments with a prescriber at least every three (3) months, or more frequently if indicated by the prescriber. The informed consent decision-making process for all new recommended psychotropic medications must be documented using form Informed Consent for Psychotropic Medication (CD-275). Dosage increases or decreases for a medication previously authorized do not require completion of this form unless the prescriber states the dose exceeds guidelines at which time, a new CD-275 will need to be completed.       Every CD-275 should be retained in the case record; form shall be uploaded to the document imaging system and placed in child’s medical section of the case record.Every child prescribed a psychotropic medication shall receive concurrent non-pharmacological treatment at the frequency and duration recommended by the prescriber Informed consent decisions are valid for one (1) year. Case Managers shall consult with supervisor once every ninety (90) days regarding informed consent decisions. These consultations shall include but are not limited to what, if any, adverse effects the child has experienced and whether the symptoms for which the drug was prescribed have been addressed, and the frequency of non-pharmacological treatment. These consultations shall be documented in FACES. A new Informed Consent for Psychotropic Medication (CD-275) form will be completed annually prior to informed consent decisions expiring.       The CD-275 should be retained in case record; form shall be uploaded to document imaging system and placed in child’s medical section of the case record. Process for Obtaining Informed Consent and Assent for Psychotropic Medication. Informed Consent No case management staff member is authorized to provide informed consent unless and until she or he successfully completes the Informed Consent training and Psychotropic Medication Management Training referenced above in section 4.3.3. Until such time, an assigned supervisor shall fulfill the informed consent functions. Special Circumstances: Except in the emergency circumstances set forth below, informed consent must be obtained voluntarily and without undue influence or coercion prior to: The administration of a newly prescribed psychotropic medication, to include the continued administration of a psychotropic medication administered to a child under the emergency circumstances set forth below, or The continued administration of a drug prescribed prior to the child entering foster care; in which case, the consent must be obtained prior to the expiration of the child’s current prescription or promptly after the child’s first medical appointment with the prescriber upon entering foster care, whichever occurs first. Emergencies: Psychotropic medications may be administered by a qualified prescriber without informed consent in an emergency situation. An emergency situation occurs when the purpose of the medication is to protect the life, safety or health of the child; to protect the life, safety or health of others; to prevent serious harm to the child or others; or to treat current or imminent substantial suffering. In instances of emergency, notification shall be provided to the case manager or authorized consenting party as soon as practicable. For a child in a residential program under contract with CD, residential program staff shall provide notice to the case manager or authorized consenting party within 24 business hours after the emergency administration of the medication. For a child in a hospital setting, the child’s case manager shall inquire within two (2) business days of the child’s hospital discharge to determine whether any psychotropic medications were administered on an emergency basis. The case manager shall document in the child’s case record in FACES any psychotropic medications administered on an emergency basis while in a residential or hospital placement. The case manager shall notify the parent within 24 hours of learning of the event. Circumstances when a Mandatory Review and Recommendation is Required PRIOR to Giving Informed Consent Before informed consent may be given in the following circumstances, CD shall make a referral to the Statewide Clinical Consultant, currently the Center for Excellence in CHILD Well-Being (The Center) and receive a recommendation as to whether consent should be granted: Before a child age three (3) or younger is prescribed any psychotropic medication; For a child age four (4) or older: Before starting a 3 rd (or more) psychotropic medication; Before starting a 2 nd (or more) antipsychotic; Before a psychotropic medication is started by a second prescriber; and Before starting a psychotropic medication that exceeds dosage guidelines. The case manager needs to make contact with the Health Information Specialist (HIS) as soon as possible upon receiving a recommendation for psychotropic medication to notify the HIS to request a referral for a mandatory review. The request or referral to The Center for a mandatory informed consent review shall be made by the HIS as soon as practicable in writing or electronically using a standardized form or template, currently the online referral for the Center for Excellence in CHILD Well-Being located on the CD intranet, Behavioral Health webpage. CD shall provide to The Center access to the information that The Center determines necessary in order to conduct the secondary review, to the extent that the information is reasonably available to CD. This may include the child’s medical history, including clinically relevant records and information. For Mandatory and Secondary Reviews: The recommendation of The Center shall be communicated in writing to the case manager within five (5) business days if the child is outpatient and three (3) business days for inpatient from the day The Center receives the written or electronic request or referral or, if requested by The Center, any other necessary information. The individual authorized to provide informed consent shall consider the recommendation and collaborate with the prescriber if necessary prior to providing an informed consent decision. Documentation of the request and the recommendation shall be included in FACES. The findings and recommendations of The Center shall be provided to the child’s parent or legal guardian; the individual authorized to provide informed consent for the medication (if an alternative consenter has been appointed by the court); child’s resource provider; and any other person or entity authorized to receive the recommendations by order of the court. The findings and recommendations of The Center may be provided to other individuals as determined appropriate which could include: Guardian Ad Litem (GAL), Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA), other members of the Family Support Team (FST), and medical providers. In the event that CD declines to share the findings and recommendations of The Center with the child’s parent or legal guardian, CD shall notify in writing any person denied access to the findings of the reason for the denial, using the Denial Notification Letter of Center for Excellence Findings, CD-280. The notice shall also explain an individual’s right to seek a review of the denial by completing a Service Delivery Grievance (CS-131) form or to file an appropriate motion with a juvenile court. Reasons CD may decline to share the findings and recommendations include the following: When a court exercising authority over the child has entered an order restricting the individuals access to information pertaining to the child Where CD determines that sharing the information may endanger the health, safety and welfare of the child or another person, or is otherwise contrary to the best interests of the child; Where CD determines that sharing the information may interfere with a child abuse, child neglect, or criminal investigation involving the Child or another child as a victim; Whenever providing the information is otherwise contrary to law. Although the authorized consenter is not bound by the recommendation of The Center, consent may not be given until after the mandatory review is completed and such recommendation has been provided and considered. Consent for a specific psychotropic medication may not be used to imply consent for a different medication. Consent need not be re-obtained for a dosage change unless the prescriber communicates to CD (through a written form or otherwise) that a dosage exceeds current FDA-approved pediatric dosage guidelines, or if no such guidelines exist, current FDA-approved adult dosage guidelines. Consenting Authority and Process Prior to Termination of Parental Rights: The case manager shall have authority to grant informed consent for the administration of psychotropic medication to a child in CD custody: provided that CD consults with one or more of the child’s parents, to the extent the parents are available and willing to participate, see Parent Opposed section below; and unless another individual or entity is authorized to make the decision by order of the juvenile or family court exercising authority over the child. Parent Engagement: Except as provided below, and emergency circumstances described above, every time a health care provider recommends the administration of a new psychotropic medication, the case manager shall: Make at least two (2) attempts, on different days (which in some circumstances may occur within the same 24-hour period, though still occurring on two different days), to contact a parent (both parents if applicable) to provide notice of the recommendation; and Attempt to reach the parent(s) by at least two (2) methods (phone, email, in-person, etc.), to the extent two such methods are available for a particular parent. Each attempt by a case manager to contact the parent(s) must be documented in FACES and on the Informed Consent for Psychotropic Medication (CD-275) form. Contact with the parent(s) shall include a conversation about the recommended treatment, such as diagnosis, purpose, names and dosages of any medications, possible side-effects, required follow-up or monitoring, availability of alternatives, and prognosis without an intervention. If, after two attempts to contact the parent(s), the case manager is not able to reach the parent(s), then the case manager may consent to or refuse the administration of the psychotropic medication at issue. The case manager will document in the FACES and on the Informed Consent for Psychotropic Medication (CD-275) form attempts to reach the parent(s), efforts to provide notice, and the decision regarding consent. Except when parent notification is not required as provided below, the parent(s) shall be provided the contact information if requested for the child’s treating health care provider in order to communicate with them directly, if the parent(s) so chooses. For every informed consent request, the case manager shall also engage the child’s resource provider, and shall notify the child’s GAL, CASA, and FST of such decisions within ten (10) business days. Parent Notification/Consultation Not Required: CD is not required to attempt to notify and/or consult with the parent(s), or give the parent the contact information of the prescribing provider, in the following circumstances: If the parent(s) is unknown, or when CD cannot locate the parent(s) after a good faith search in accordance with CD policy; If the parent(s) has abandoned the child for a period of ninety (90) days without any meaningful contact (visits, support, participation in court/FSTMs/child’s treatment); If a court exercising authority over the child has entered an order restricting parental access to information pertaining to the child; If CD determines that sharing the information may endanger the health, safety, or welfare of the child or another person, or is otherwise contrary to the best interests of the child; If CD determines that sharing the information may interfere with a child abuse, child neglect, or criminal investigation involving the child or another child as a victim; or If providing the information is otherwise contrary to law.The case manager remains the consenter until the child is adopted or until a juvenile court issues an order authorizing an alternate person, such as the pre-adoptive parent, to provide consent. For every informed consent request, the case manager shall engage the child’s resource provider, and shall notify the child’s GAL, CASA, and FST of informed consent decisions within 10 business days. If the parental rights of both parents have been terminated, or the court has otherwise restricted both parents’ access to medical information about the child, the case manager may provide informed consent for the administration of psychotropic medications without attempting parental notification. The case manager remains the consenter until the child is adopted or until a juvenile court issues an order authorizing an alternate person, such as the pre-adoptive parent, to provide consent. For every informed consent request, the case manager shall engage the child’s resource provider, and shall notify the child’s GAL, CASA, and FST of informed consent decisions within 10 business days. Parent Opposed to Proposed Course of Treatment: If a parent disagrees with a case manager’s informed consent decision, the matter shall be referred to The Center, unless a review from The Center has been completed involving the same proposed course of treatment. The case manager shall, after being informed and confirming that such a disagreement exists, shall contact the Health Information Specialist (HIS). The (HIS) shall submit a referral to The Center within five (5) business days.   The referral to the Center should be made using The Center’s online referral request form. The Center shall, within five (5) business days of receiving the request for consultation, review the pending prescription and provide an opinion and recommendation as to the appropriateness and timing of the prescription (including but not limited to whether the child should begin taking the proposed medication immediately). Documentation of the request and the recommendation shall be included in the child’s case record. The individual authorized to provide informed consent shall consider the recommendation and collaborate with the prescriber if necessary prior to providing an informed consent decision. Documentation of the request and the recommendation shall be included in the child’s case record. The findings and recommendations of The Center shall be provided to the child’s parent or legal guardian; the individual authorized to provide informed consent for the medication (if an alternative consenter has been appointed by the court); Child’s Resource Provider; and any other person or entity authorized to receive the recommendation by order of the court. The findings and recommendations of The Center may be provided to other individuals as determined appropriate which could include: GAL, CASA, other members of the FST, and medical providers. In the event that CD declines to share the findings and recommendations of The Center to the child’s parent or legal guardian, CD shall notify in writing the reason for the denial using the Denial Notification Letter of Center for Excellence Findings, CD-280. The notice shall also explain an individual’s right to an administrative review of that decision or to file an appropriate motion with a juvenile court. Reasons CD may decline to share the findings and recommendation include the following: When a court exercising authority over the child has entered an order restricting the individuals access to information pertaining to the child Where CD determines that sharing the information may endanger the health, safety and welfare of the child or another person, or is otherwise contrary to the best interests of the child; Where CD determines that sharing the information may interfere with a child abuse, child neglect, or criminal investigation involving the Child or another child as a victim; Whenever providing the information is otherwise contrary to law. If a parent does not agree with the recommendation from The Center, the parent may (a) within five (5) business days from the date the parent was informed of the recommendations initiate a service delivery grievance, or (b) at any time, file an appropriate motion with the juvenile court. If the case manager does not receive notice of a service delivery grievance or motion filed with the juvenile court within six (6) business days from the date the parent was informed of the recommendations, the case manager may consent to or refuse the course of treatment at issue. The case manager will document in FACES attempts to reach the parent(s), efforts to provide notice, and the decision regarding consent. If The Center has recommended immediate administration of a psychotropic medication, then the case manager may follow that recommendation, regardless of any pending service delivery grievance or juvenile court motion filed by the parent. If The Center recommends that immediate administration of a psychotropic medication is not required, then the case manager will not consent to the medication until any service delivery grievance or juvenile court motion has been resolved. Alternative Consenters: In the event any member of the FST seeks to serve as the consenting authority for the administration of psychotropic medications to a child, CD will, to the extent permitted by the juvenile court, inform the court and request an opportunity for the proposed alternative consenter to be heard. CD may require that such a request be provided in writing, include the reasons for the request and a statement that the alternative consenter will provide informed consent. CD’s responsibility will be only to inform the juvenile court and the parties of the request, not to support the request. Notice of the right to pursue this process shall be provided in writing to all members of the FST utilizing the Learn Your Rights flyer (CD-287). CD staff will provide the CD-287 at the initial FST meeting and again if their child is prescribed a psychotropic medication. Documentation of the distribution of this flyer (date and to whom) shall be recorded in the narrative section in FACES. In the rare instance that a child is placed in the joint custody of CD and DYS, while the child is in a placement arranged by DYS, DYS shall be the consenting authority. DYS shall keep the CD case manager fully informed regarding all medical and behavioral health care received including any recommended treatment or medication changes as they occur. Standardized Form (CD-275) Required When Giving Informed Consent: All informed consent decisions must be documented on the Informed Consent for Psychotropic Medication (CD-275) form. Any authorized consenting party (i.e. case manager, alternative consenter, or youth over 18) must complete and sign the form. If the authorized consenting party is a CD staff member the completed and signed CD-275 must be uploaded to the document imaging system. Information Required for Informed Consent: The case manager or other authorized consenting party shall ensure that he or she has the following information before making an informed consent decision: The results of the behavioral health/psychiatric evaluation of the child including the child’s diagnosis or diagnoses, along with the target symptoms to be addressed by the medication; An explanation of the purpose of the medication, the anticipated duration of treatment, and its expected results; Whether medically necessary metabolic and other screenings indicated by the prescriber have been completed at the recommended frequency (e.g. bloodwork, BMI, weight); Whether, according to the prescriber, (i) each medication is FDA-approved for pediatric use, or (ii) there are any limitations on FDA-approval related to the age of the child and the diagnosis; The short and long-term risks and possible benefits associated with the medication and any combination of medications prescribed, including the nature and possible occurrence of any adverse effects and/or irreversible symptoms; Alternative non-pharmacological treatments that have not yet been attempted and their risks and benefits; Alternative non-pharmacological treatments that were attempted and not successful; The known allergies of the child; The current illnesses of the child; The psychiatric history and treatments of the child; The risks and benefits of not undergoing treatment; Any other medications the child has received in the past and the child’s reaction to those drugs; and Any other information necessary to provide informed consent relating to the medical treatment of the child. Secondary Review Requests for Medication or Other Recommended Treatment Requesting a Secondary Review A referral for a Secondary Review shall be made for any of the following: The case manager has concerns about psychotropic medications being prescribed, or any other recommended physical or behavioral health intervention. The parent or child disagrees with a case manager’s informed consent decision. A request from members of the child’s FST, including the child, child’s parents or legal guardian, the child’s GAL or CASA, the child’s resource provider, and the Juvenile Officer for a secondary review of the child’s psychotropic medications or any other recommended physical or behavioral health intervention. The case manager needs to make contact with HIS as soon as possible once a decision has been made that a secondary review is necessary based upon the criteria listed above, clearly documenting why the review is being requested. The HIS will make a referral to The Center. The referral form is located on the CD intranet Behavioral Health webpage and should be completed and submitted electronically. The electronic referral form shall be submitted within five (5) business days. The HIS shall provide a fully completed referral form with all the required supporting documentation, and any additional information The Center determines necessary to conduct the secondary review. Supporting documentation includes: medical records with current diagnosis, prescriber notes, current medication list including dose and frequency, lab results, psychiatric evaluation, therapy reports and other records related to the child’s behavior or diagnosis.   The HIS shall provide supporting documentation to the extent that information is reasonably available to CD. The secondary review conducted by The Center shall include an assessment of: The child’s diagnosis(es); Appropriateness, efficacy, and potential adverse effects or risks of current psychotropic medication(s); The child’s medication history as it relates to psychotropic medications prescribed to the child; Why the current psychotropic medication(s) is/are being used; Whether the medically necessary lab work and/or baseline health screenings have been completed as they relate to psychotropic medications prescribed to the child, and any adjustments indicated by the results of such lab work or screenings; A plan to taper off of psychotropic medications where medically appropriate; Whether the documentation supports the diagnosis being treated, recognizing that the Qualified Psychiatrist cannot make a diagnosis; and Whether other non-pharmacological interventions have been or are currently being provided for the child. The HIS may, at their discretion, decline to refer the case for more than one review for a particular child within the same sixty (60) day period. All referrals for secondary review and resulting recommendations must be documented in FACES. Automatic Quarterly Case Reviews Each quarter The Center evaluates and analyzes information on children in alternative care who are administered psychotropic medication(s). The Center may request a case review to assess the use of psychotropic medication(s) for a child. If a child’s case has been selected for a review, The Center will send an electronic notification to the case manager, case manager supervisor and the HIS. If The Center requests documentation, the HIS will have ten (10) business days from the date of receiving the electronic notification to collect the materials or documents and send to The Center. When the case review is complete, The Center will send a findings and recommendations letter to the case manager, case manager supervisor and HIS. The letter should be sent within five (5) business days from the date of the notice or the date The Center received the requested documents. The case manager and case manager’s supervisor will review the findings and recommendations letter to determine how to process the recommendation(s). HIS staff can assist the case manager with processing the recommendation(s). The Center will send an electronic alert to the case manager and case manager’s supervisor requesting information on how the recommendation(s) was processed. The criteria for an automatic case review is: Use of an antipsychotic or atypical antipsychotic medication in a child age four (4) or younger. For a child age five (5) or older: Use of five or more concurrent psychotropic medications for 90 days or more; Use of two or more concurrent antipsychotic medications for 90 days or more; and Multiple prescribers of any psychotropic medication for 90 days or more. The criteria for an automatic case review after December 5, 2020 is: Use of any Psychotropic Medication for a child age three (3) or younger. For a child age four (4) or older: Use of three or more psychotropic medications for 90 days or more; Use of two or more concurrent antipsychotic medications for 90 days or more; Multiple prescribers of any Psychotropic Medication for 90 days or more; and A Child is prescribed a dose in excess of the guidelines referenced in section”For Mandatory and Secondary Reviews.” Children’s Rights Bodily integrity is the principle that it is the right of each human being, including children, to autonomy and self-determination over their own body. Children who have been abused or neglected often feel little control over what happens to them. Children should be routinely involved in the process of making routine and non-routine treatment decisions, to the extent appropriate. These communications should occur in a developmentally appropriate, judgment-free manner and in a physical space offering confidentiality to ask questions and share concerns. Children may need multiple opportunities to ask questions and receive information in order to build skills to become capable and confident health care consumers. These interactions also offer the opportunity to assess the child’s level of understanding about what to expect with tests or treatment and to help them develop awareness about their physical and behavioral health. At minimum, children should be offered the opportunity to: Know their diagnosis Understand all the treatment options Ask questions about potential benefits and side effects Participate in decision-making to the extent that is developmentally appropriate Receive assistance from the family support team to help with decisions Obtain or refuse birth control Consent to substance abuse treatment when 16 years of age or older Refuse psychotropic medication after being offered the opportunity to consult with their health care provider Informed Assent (under age 18) During the assent process, the child is engaged and his or her input is sought allowing them to voice their preferences and concerns. It is important to have conversations about prescribed medication or treatment, as age and developmentally appropriate, with all children. For youth ages 12 and above, informed assent shall be obtained in writing. Obtain Assent: Before providing informed consent for a psychotropic medication, the case manager or supervisor (in coordination with the alternative consenter, if applicable) must seek to obtain informed assent from the youth, consistent with the following: In partnership with the child’s treating health care provider, ensure that the child is informed, in an age and developmentally appropriate manner, of the recommendation for prescribed medication(s) as part of the child’s treatment plan. In partnership with the child’s treating health care provider, ensure the child is provided an opportunity to voice his or her reactions or concerns regarding prescribed medication(s). Ensure that the child (if over age 12) and the child’s attorney/GAL (for a child of any age), are provided the Learn Your Rights flyer CD-281 to provide notice in writing of: All rights set forth above, along with the right to file a service delivery grievance or to file a motion with the juvenile court; The right to speak privately with the health care provider regarding any proposed psychotropic medication; The right to seek a second opinion from a different health care provider regarding any psychotropic medication; and The right for children age 12-17 to request that their refusal to assent to the administration of a psychotropic medication be reviewed by the Center. The request will follow the same timeline and requirements set forth in above in the Parent Opposed to Proposed Course of Treatment section. Give the child the opportunity to sign the Informed Consent for Psychotropic Medication (CD-275) and ensure that the signed form is placed in the child’s case record. The case manager will give the CD-281 in person during first contact with child and/or GAL when providing Family-Centered Out-of-Home services, when a prescriber is recommending administration of a psychotropic medication, when the child turns 12 (twelve), and annually until the child is eighteen (18) years of age. If the GAL is not present during the FST meeting case manager will contact the GAL and provide the flyer either electronically or mailed to the GAL’s address. Expiration of Assent: Except in cases of a medically significant change in circumstances, informed assent shall expire and must be re-sought 12 months from the date the assent is provided or withheld. Youth 18 Years or Older Once a youth has reached 18 years of age, the ability to give consent or refuse treatment shall transfer from the case manager to the youth. The case manager should be available to answer questions and assist the youth in making an informed decision. The only exception to this is if a court order has been obtained that such a transfer would not be in the youth’s best interest due to lack of capacity or disability that prevents the youth from making medical decisions. In that event, the case manager should continue as the consenter but involve the youth in the decision-making process to the greatest extent possible.

"MO :: Section 4, Chapter 4 (Working with Children), Subsection 3 – Medical and Behavioral Health Planning :: 4.3.2 Medical and Behavioral Health Case Management",Missouri,Rules,"2023, 2022, 2021","Services while in care - Medical, Services while in care - Mental Health",,,"Children’s Division (CD) shall ensure that children in the agency’s custody receive appropriate medical and behavioral health care. Each child’s care must include: Emergency treatment, whenever necessary; Timely examination and treatment of nonemergency injuries and illnesses; Provision of ongoing allied health services, like physical or occupational therapy, when recommended. Allied health professionals are not doctors, dentists or nurses, but others who aim to prevent, diagnose and treat a range of conditions and illnesses and often work within a multidisciplinary health team to provide the best patient outcomes; Proper assessment and care of behavioral health issues; and Regular preventive care appropriate to the child’s age and condition, including immunizations Initial Family Support Team (FST) Meeting: At the first FST meeting following the child’s placement in alternative care, the case manager shall inform the parent(s) that CD will expect them to take an active role in health care decisions about the child, unless the FST determines that would be contrary to the best interests of the child.  An active role would include, but is not limited to: Attending the child’s appointments; Demonstrating an understanding of the child’s health status and recommendations of any providers; and Providing necessary care and medication during visitation and trial home placement. The case manager shall keep the parent(s) informed of the child’s medical and behavioral health decisions.  The case manager is responsible for the child’s medical and behavioral health care while the child is in CD custody.  The case manager shall partner with the parent(s), the child (to the extent reasonable for the child’s age and understanding), resource providers, and primary health care providers. The case manager will attempt to contact these partners prior to the provision of any treatment.  The parent(s) will be asked to return the completed Child/Family Health and Development Assessment (CW-103) within a week of the Initial FST if not returned at the time of the meeting. If the parent does not return the completed CW-103, the case manager shall engage the parent to obtain the necessary information to complete the CW-103 and share information with resource provider. All information about the child’s medical or behavioral health care while in alternative care shall be shared with the parent/caregiver on an ongoing basis unless Termination of Parental Rights (TPR) has occurred or the court has issued an order preventing the parent/guardian access to the information. Ongoing Case Management Provision of Appropriate Care: The health of a child in alternative care is of paramount importance throughout the child’s placement. The resource provider shall obtain a medical examination for the child immediately following initial placement and at least annually thereafter    in cooperation with CD. This requirement is satisfied by completion of Initial Health Examination    or the Full Healthy Children and Youth (HCY) Screening. Initial Health Examination: An initial health examination should occur when the child enters care. When possible, this should be completed by the current primary care physician as they are already familiar with the child’s medical history . If a provider is not readily accessible, this exam must occur within seventy-two (72) hours of the initial placement. The case manager need not attend these initial examinations; however, they should receive documentation of the results of the examination of the appointment and ensure compliance with any recommended follow-up treatment/interventions. Full HCY Screenings: A full HCY screening consists of a physical examination, and other developmental components, including but not limited to vision, hearing, social/emotional and dental screenings. The screenings shall be completed no later than thirty (30) days after the child is placed in (CD) custody. If it is not possible to schedule the appointment within thirty (30) days, the reason for the delay shall be documented in FACES and the screenings completed at the earliest possible date. Staff should promptly follow up on any recommendations from the screening. An Initial Health Examination may be considered a Full HCY screening if the Initial Health Examination contains a review of all sections within the HCY screening. Ongoing Medical Assessments: Children’s Division shall maintain best practices in monitoring the child’s health as required by federal and state laws, and as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Child Welfare League of America (CWLA), which set forth that certain medical appointments occur timely to assess and monitor the child’s health. All children in the custody of the Children’s Division shall receive medical assessments   in accordance with the “Bright Futures /American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Recommendations for Preventive Pediatric Health Care” also known as the “Periodicity Schedule.” The periodicity schedule is based on age and may require some children to have more frequent visits than children in other age groups. https://web.archive.org/web/20230126132131/https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/periodicity_schedule.pdf Some medical care, even though standard or routine, may be controversial in some families.  With respect to those issues, the case manager shall follow CD policy as set forth below. Dental Examinations: Immediately following placement the resource provider should obtain a dental examination for the child as recommended by the dentist or every six (6) months; but at least annually. Dental exams are performed by dentists or qualified dental professionals. During a dental exam, the dentist or hygienist will check for cavities and gum disease and may clean the child’s teeth. The exam involves a more comprehensive oral health evaluation and may include dental X-rays or other diagnostic procedures, when indicated. Oral hygiene habits and anticipatory guidance are typical points of discussion during each visit. Dental Exam Periodicity Schedule – When and How Often Exams Should Occur First Dental Exam: The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) recommends the first dental examination occur at the time of the child’s first tooth eruption , or no later than 12 months of age. A child’s developing primary teeth (or “baby teeth”) are susceptible to decay as soon as they appear. This first visit provides the early opportunity to check existing teeth for decay and to assess any potential problems with the child’s gums, bite, oral tissues, and jaw. The dentist can provide guidance on baby bottle tooth decay, infant feeding practice, teething, pacifier habits, finger-sucking habits, and mouth cleaning. Ongoing Dental Exams: Dental exams are recommended every six (6) months , or more frequently if recommended by the dentist based on the child’s risk status. Child’s First Dental Exam Following Entry in to Alternative Care All children entering alternative care must have a full, comprehensive HCY screening within thirty (30) days. Included in this physical health and developmental assessment are vision, hearing, and dental screenings. The dental screening may be completed by the physician performing the physical exam, or the child can be taken to a dentist to receive this screening. A full dental examination is not required during this thirty (30)-day timeframe solely due to the child’s entry into alternative care. However, if during the HCY dental screening the provider indicates a need for a full dental/oral examination, the physician will make a referral and staff shall ensure this exam occurs. This dental exam must be performed by a dentist or qualifying dental professional. Because dental exams are recommended every six (6) months, staff should promptly collect the child’s dental records upon entry into alternative care to ascertain when the child last had a dental exam and when he/she should visit the dentist next. These records can be obtained from the child’s dental provider, or by accessing the information via CyberAccess for MO HealthNet recipients. If the child has no history of a dental exam, the child’s first dental exam should be scheduled based on the anticipatory guidance given by the physician during the thirty (30)-day HCY screening, but no later than six (6) months from entering CD custody. Immunizations: The case manager or resource provider will ensure that children in the agency’s custody are immunized against disease, in accordance with the Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS) current guidelines.  The DHSS immunization guidelines are: 2022 Recommended Child and Adolescent Immunization Schedule for 0-18 years of age and the 2022 Recommended Child and Adolescent Immunization Schedule for 19 and older. If a parent has an objection to the administration of an immunization based upon religious or health reasons, the parent should inform the case manager or resource provider and the parent may choose to address the issue with the Court. The administration of an immunization can be performed; unless there is a court order exempting the child from receiving the immunization. Any information pertaining to an immunization will be documented in FACES and all documents uploaded to OnBase and a copy placed in the child’s physical file. Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) currently granted for COVID-19: The case manager, resource provider, or youth 18 and older who provide their own consent, may provide consent for any vaccines approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The case manager will refer to following guidelines https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/covid-19.html , to determine if vaccine has been approved for a child specific age group. The case manager and resource provider will talk with the child in an age and developmentally appropriate manner about receiving the EUA vaccine, just like other health care decisions, and ensure that the child understands: receiving the vaccine is voluntary; the physician can help answer any questions about the vaccine,  benefits, or potential side effects. The case manager will then consult with the child’s physician regarding whether it is appropriate for the child to receive the vaccine. Upon the recommendation of the child to be vaccinated, the case manager will discuss the recommendation with the parent(s)/legal guardian. The case manager will make at least two (2) attempts to contact a parent (both parents if applicable)/legal guardian. Contact with the parent(s)/legal guardian will include a conversation about the recommended treatment and possible side effects.  The COVID-19 Vaccination Information document may be used to assist the case manager with providing additional information to the parent(s)/legal guardian. If contact is made the case manager will inform the parent(s)/legal guardian of the recommendation and confirm consent or opt-out of a COVID-19 vaccine. All direct contact and attempts to contact shall be documented in FACES. In the event that a parent(s)/legal guardian and the child are not in agreement whether to receive the vaccine or to opt-out, the case manager will facilitate a discussion with the family to attempt to reach a consensus, and may provide educational resources to inform the decision-making process. If a consensus is not reached, the case manager will make a referral to the Division of Legal Services. If the case manager is unable to contact the parent(s) within a reasonable timeframe the case manager may follow the physician’s recommendations regarding vaccination of the child and document consent. The consent document will be uploaded to OnBase and a copy placed in the child’s physical file. The case manager will instruct the resource provider to monitor the child and contact the case manager as soon as possible, if the child is experiencing any side effects. Reproductive Health: Information on sexual health, education, including information on sexually transmitted infections and birth control should be made available to a child, appropriate to their age and physical and emotional maturity.  The case manager shall document when and by whom this education was provided.  Educational information and prevention resources shall be made available to parent(s) and/or resource providers as requested for discussion with the child. Birth Control: Children in foster care are afforded the choice to obtain or refuse birth control.  Missouri law does not require minors to have parental consent to obtain contraception, although it is the practice of some medical providers.  If the medical provider requires signed consent, CD may provide the written consent. Attendance at Health-Related Appointments: After a child is placed in the custody of CD, parent(s) and resource provider attendance at the child’s health-related appointments is expected and welcomed, in most instances.  The case manager should invite the parent(s) and resource provider to attend all health-related appointments at least three days in advance, whenever possible.  There may be special circumstances in which it is not in the best interests of the child for the parent(s) to be involved in health care decisions about the child.  In these cases, the case manager should speak to their supervisor and may consider a referral to the Division of Legal Services or CD attorney. If behavioral health therapy is arranged for the child, ideally the case manager will attend the initial appointment with the child.  If the case manager is unable to attend the initial appointment, s/he must communicate with the therapist prior to the appointment to discuss the child’s needs and provide consent to begin treatment.  If a child is referred for psychiatric assessment or care, the case manager or supervisor must attend all initial appointments. Communication Regarding Health Care Needs: The case manager should recognize that continued collaboration with the parent(s), child, resource provider, and primary health care providers will lead to clearer communication and provision of services in the child’s best interests, resulting in a smoother transition in the event of any change, including at the time of reunification or, for an older youth, placement in independent living. Family Support Team (FST) Meetings: FST meetings shall include a discussion of medical and behavioral health updates, unless the case manager has determined that such discussion is contrary to the child’s best interests. A supervisor should be consulted regarding any such determination and an explanation provided to the FST, with appropriate documentation in FACES. Notice of the right to pursue being designated as an alternative consenter for psychotropic medications is to be provided to all members of the FST at each meeting. See Alternative Consenter in 4.3.3. Parent(s): Unless termination of parental rights has occurred or the court has issued an order restricting parent(s) access to information, the case manager will routinely share information about the child’s health with the parent(s) during home visits and will timely respond to requests for information.  Additionally, the case manager shall engage the parent(s) promptly about any major change in the child’s health status, including, but not limited to, significant injury, new diagnosis or medication, or any emergency treatment or hospitalization.  The parent(s) should be asked to provide updates about any newly acquired knowledge of familial illness which might impact the child and to promptly inform CD of any illness or injury incurred by the child during visitation with the parent(s). Child: Children and youth should participate as much as possible in making decisions about their medical care.  Children should be encouraged by the team members to communicate information or worries about their health to parent(s), resource providers, the case manager, and to health care providers.  Case managers should ask a child’s opinion about proposed medical care and discuss safe use of medication, as developmentally appropriate.  Providing a child with information: helps the child achieve developmentally appropriate awareness of health status; tells the child what to expect about treatment; helps to prepare a child for assuming more responsibility for health care decisions as they develop; aids the case manager and other adults involved in the child’s care to assess the child’s understanding of the situation; and solicits the child’s willingness to accept the proposed care. Children/youth age twelve (12) or older shall be provided written notice of their rights regarding assent as described in the Informed Assent section. The Guardian Ad Litem (GAL) and any attorney for every child shall also be provided written notice of children’s rights regarding assent. Staff shall document in the case record when and to whom the Learn Your Rights (CD-281) form was provided. Resource Provider: The case manager will provide all available medical and behavioral health information to the resource provider as required by law.  The case manager and the resource provider will regularly review the child’s health care status throughout the duration of the child’s placement. The resource provider will notify the case manager as soon as possible of any significant injury or illness of the child. Court: The case manager shall provide a comprehensive summary regarding the child’s health in regular court reports and shall include any current diagnoses and medications, if any. Children’s Division Responsibilities: In addition to the historical documentation cited in this chapter and the provision of such documentation to a resource provider upon initial placement of a child, CD has an overarching responsibility to ensure that current medical information is documented throughout a child’s placement in care. CD shall exercise reasonable and diligent efforts to compile and maintain the medical records for each child in alternative care. Collection of medical history and updating the child’s medical records are continuing and shared responsibilities. The case manager will obtain medical information for each child in their caseload. The case manager will upload any medical and/or behavioral health documents into the document imaging system and maintain a physical paper file, if the records were not received electronically. The Health Information Specialists (HIS) are available in each region to assist the case manager with coordination of obtaining the documents. All efforts to involve the child and parent(s) in decisions about the health care of the child shall be documented in FACES by the case manager.  Documentation should include the child’s response and the parent’s actual involvement or reasons why the parent could not or should not be involved.  If the parent(s) cannot be located, the case manager will document any efforts taken to notify them. Available documentation shall be uploaded into document imaging system. All medical, mental health, medication, behavioral and any other identified needs specific to the child should be documented in the Social Service Plan Child Section. Each identified need should include the plan to address the need, who will be involved to help meet the need and next steps. These needs shall be reviewed and progress documented in the FACES contact note during every home visit with the parent/caregiver/guardian, every visit with the child and placement provider and every FST. Any changes to the Social Service Plan Child Section should be reflected in the next reassessment. Medical Records – Compilation and Access Case Record: The case manager and HIS may collaborate to obtain and upload any historical and current medical and/or behavioral health documents. These documents are maintained in the document imaging system and can be retrieved to compile a medical record for the child.  This medical record shall include full and accurate medical information and history, including but not limited to the following:  Medical and surgical history, dental history, psychosocial history, past behavioral health and psychiatric history, including medication history and documented benefits and adverse effects; past hospitalization or residential treatment history; allergies; immunizations; current and past medications, including current dosage and directions for administration; family health history; treatment and/or service plans, and results of any clinically indicated lab work. Process and Documentation: To the extent applicable, such efforts shall include, but not be limited to, accessing Medicaid claims data, requesting information from current and past medical care providers known to CD, reaching out to the child’s health insurance plan, gathering records from past foster care episodes, and gathering records and information from parents (whose rights have not been terminated) or guardians and other family members involved in the child’s health care. Access to Medical Records/Providing Medical Information When a child is placed in alternative care, the case manager placing the child will request pertinent medical information from the parent(s) or other caregiver, to include information necessary to provide immediate care for the child, including current medications, if any, and complete the Health Care Information Summary (CD-264).  Ideally, the CD-264 should be provided to the resource provider at the time of the child’s placement. The case manager will obtain comprehensive health and developmental information about the child from the parents or other significant adults in the children’s life and/or health care providers, using the Child/Family Health and Development Assessment (CW-103). The case manager should begin the process of completing these forms with the family at the time of initial contact; but should continue to engage the family to gather information during subsequent visits until the form is complete. The Monthly Medical Log (CD-265) was created to assist the resource provider and residential facilities in documenting health related needs, informed consent decisions for routine care, medications, and appointments regarding the child. The CD-265 is to be maintained and supplemented by the resource provider throughout the child’s placement and is to be submitted to the case manager monthly, primarily during the case manager’s visit with the child in the child’s placement. The CD-265 also offers an opportunity for the resource provider to provide information about the child’s progress and needs related to the child’s health. The residential treatment provider must provide the case manager with the completed CD-  265 as well as the Medication Administration Record (MAR) by the 5th day of the following   month. The written documentation must contain all medication administered for the month,   including the dosage and any new medications prescribed, including the dosage. Initial Placement: When a child has been placed in any alternative care setting for the first time since coming into the legal custody of CD, the case manager will ensure that the CD-264 and the Child/Family Health and Developmental Assessment (CW-103) are provided to the resource provider or residential care providers within seventy-two (72) hours whenever possible but no later than thirty (30) days following placement. While the parent or legal guardian should be primarily responsible for completing the CW-103, it is the case manager’s duty, even if the parent does not assist in completion of the assessment paperwork, for ensuring that both forms are as accurate and complete as possible, and are given to the resource provider within thirty (30) days. Case managers shall also document when and to whom the health information (CD-264 and CW-103) was provided. Subsequent Placements: If a placement change must occur, the case manager will provide to the new resource provider or residential care provider the CW-103, an updated version of CD-264, and a copy of the resource provider or residential care provider’s medical file, including all CD-265s, from the child’s prior foster care placements. This information will be made available at the time of placement, but no later than seventy-two (72) hours following placement. This history shall include all information gathered and provided at the time of initial placement and all additional information maintained by the previous resource provider (including information that has been provided to the case manager). Any medication previously prescribed for the child should be delivered in the original container with written instructions. Case mangers shall document when and to whom the health information (CD-264, CW-103 and CD-265) was provided. The case manager will provide the names and contact information for all of the child’s current and past behavioral health, dental, and medical providers, and upload all signed forms i.e., CW-103, CD-264, CD-265 and CD-275 into the document imaging system. Efforts to obtain the information described shall be documented in FACES. The case manager is not required to perform the initial and subsequent placement process for hospital placements.

Extraordinary Care Treatment Extraordinary care services include, but are not limited to, extraordinary dental treatment, sterilization, experimental/hormonal drug treatments, invasive or extensive medical testing, any elective body modification requiring general anesthesia i.e., gender reassignment , and any other procedures governed by local court rule or as otherwise directed by the local juvenile court. The case manager will consult with the Division of Legal Services to assist in obtaining a court order for extraordinary care services. Health Information Specialist The Health Information Specialist (HIS) is part of the HIS team implemented in January 2019 in advance of the Psychotropic Medication Joint Settlement Agreement (Agreement). The Agreement outlines that CD shall maintain an adequate number of full time staff members statewide for the purpose of gathering and maintaining full and accurate medical information and history for each child in CD custody. The HIS team is responsible to ensure that all elements of the Agreement are monitored, documented and that CD is in compliance with the Agreement requirements. The HIS team members are under the direction of the Health Specialist Coordinator and two Unit Managers. A HIS team member is located in each region throughout the State. Informed Consent Informed consent is the agreement to any medical or behavioral health treatment (such as a medical service or procedure) given after the child, parent, and/or legal custodian has had the opportunity to receive sufficient information about its risks and benefits. Consent must be given, after receiving all necessary information, based upon what is in the best interests of the child. To make an informed decision about behavioral health treatment or medications without undue influence/coercion, which means that the consenter is deciding based on what is best for the child, not because of pressure to consent to the medication or treatment services. For example, a decision must not be made based on a school’s or other entity’s insistence that a child take medication in order to participate or receive services, or continue placement. The case manager cannot provide informed consent for psychotropic medications until he/she completes the psychotropic medication management and informed consent trainings. Non-Routine Treatment Non-routine treatment includes, but is not limited to: surgery, inpatient hospitalization, behavioral therapy or behavioral health services and psychiatric treatment. Psychotropic Medication In this section the following classes and medications are considered psychotropic medications: Antipsychotics; Antidepressants; Lithium; Stimulants; Alpha agonists ( e.g. , clonidine or guanfacine); Anxiolytics/hypnotics ( e.g. , benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines); and Anticonvulsants/mood stabilizers. A psychotropic medication may be any medicine that affects the mind, emotions or behavior. In addition to the categories above, other medicines, including herbal remedies, may be used that affect mind, emotions or behavior. Some of the medications above may be prescribed for physical health reasons. If a case manager or other team member has questions about whether a medication should be considered a psychotropic, even after discussing it with the prescriber, the case manager should consult with a HIS for direction. Routine (Standard) Treatment Routine (Standard) Treatment includes, but is not limited to: ordinary illnesses, routine dental care, immunizations, well child visits, preventative health services, on-going treatment for chronic medical health conditions, and necessary routine testing for those chronic conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, and ear infections.

The resource provider/Children’s Division staff should enroll the child in their new school immediately to minimize disruption to their education.  Staff should provide the school liaison the Educational Enrollment Letter (CD-179) identifying the child’s case manager, placement provider, educational decision maker, educational surrogate, and the domicile district. Educational Decision Maker:   Rights and responsibilities of a parent including enrollment, course selection, determining participation in special programs or extracurricular activities, receive report cards and other school correspondence, etc. The child’s case manager may act in this role on a temporary basis, but the child’s current placement provider is the most appropriate individual to serve in this capacity. Educational Surrogate: Acts in the role of a parent for a student with a disability whenever decisions are being made about the student’s educational placement and programs. A resource parent can make these decisions as part of being the child’s Educational Decision Maker, but children living in a congregate care setting do not have an identified parent/caretaker and must be appointed an Educational Surrogate. Section 162.999.1, RSMo prohibits the Educational Surrogate from having a conflict of interest with the child represented and prohibits the Children’s Division from serving in this role for any child in CD custody. An Educational Surrogate appointment can be requested from DESE who trains and contracts with impartial individuals around the state. Domicile District: The school district in which the student would have been educated if the student had not been placed in a different school district by the Children’s Division. DESE interpretation of the law presumes the school district where the student would have attended is where the student’s parent or legal guardian lives. The educating school district is permitted by Section 167.126, RSMo to back bill the domicile district for the cost of educating the child. This cost recovery is allowed as long as at least one parent maintains parental rights to the child. The Foster Care Education Bill of Rights of 2009 (Sections 167.018, 167.019 RSMo) promotes educational stability for children in foster care by requiring child-placing agencies to consider school of origin when making placement decision.  The Bill of Rights also outlines mandates for school districts around enrollment procedures, credit transfer, graduation requirements, and school records access.  The Foster Care Education Bill of Rights : Requires school districts to designate a staff person as the educational liaison for foster children.  The liaison shall do the following in an advisory capacity: Ensure and facilitate the proper educational placement, enrollment in school, and checkout from school of foster children Assist foster care pupils when transferring schools by ensuring proper transfer of credits, records, and grades Request school records within two business days of placement of a foster child in a school, and Submit records of a foster child within three business days of receiving a request for school records.

"MO :: Section 4, Chapter 4 (Working with Children), Subsection 2 – Educational Stability :: 4.2.2 Transportation",Missouri,Rules,"2023, 2022, 2021",Services while in care - Educational,,,"The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requires local educational agencies (LEAs) to collaborate with local child welfare agencies to ensure transportation for children in foster care is provided, arranged, and funded for the duration of a child’s time in foster care.  ESSA further provides that LEAs must ensure: Children in foster care needing transportation to their school of origin will promptly receive that transportation in a cost-effective manner; and If there are additional costs incurred in providing transportation to the school of origin, the LEA will provide such transportation if (1) the local child welfare agency agrees to reimburse the LEA for the cost of such transportation; (2) the LEA agrees to pay for the cost; or (3) the LEA and local child welfare agency agree to share the cost. The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) provides options for the team to consider. This is not an exhaustive list of options; LEAs and local child welfare agencies should explore all possible options: An existing bus route can be used. An existing bus route can be modified slightly to accommodate the new address. Specialized transportation offered to other students can be accessed, such as: Special Education Alternative education Magnet School McKinney-Vento transportation Existing specialized transportation can be modified slightly to accommodate the new address. The school district has additional options that could be accessed, such as using a district car. The school district may identify alternatives not provided by the school district that the Children’s Division could access or that the school district would be willing to assist in accessing. This may include the district facilitating arrangements or providing transportation (e.g. cabs or other contracted transport) and receiving reimbursement. Children’s Division can explore options outside of those provided by the district, such as reimbursing the resource parent for transportation costs, or including transport in contracts with licensed residential treatment facilities. NOTE: If the student has an IEP that includes provisions for specialized transportation, transportation must be provided by the school district responsible for the student’s Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE). Based on the location of the resource home, some of the options above may not create additional costs to the school district. Other options may and, therefore, LEAs and local child welfare agencies must coordinate to explore all options and develop plans for providing and funding transportation for children to remain in their school of origin, if determined to be in the child’s best interest. If the BID results in the child remaining in the school of origin, and the transportation plan creates an additional cost to the school district and the two agencies agree to share the cost, the financial Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and related Attachment A should be executed.  The MOU outlines the responsibilities of CD/FCCM and the school district around invoicing and reimbursement processes for additional transportation costs incurred pursuant to ESSA.  The MOU is standardized and approved by the Division of Legal Services and the Division of Financial Administrative Services (DFAS), and therefore, may not be altered.  Executing this MOU with a school district involves the following steps: An MOU should be executed with a school district only once a transportation cost-sharing agreement is negotiated for a child to maintain him/her in the school of origin, pursuant to ESSA. This will limit the number of MOUs to only those with a business need identified. The MOU and Attachment A can be accessed via: Intranet ” Programs ” FCOOHC Intranet ” Employee Tools A-Z Only one MOU is needed for each school district, regardless of which circuit executed it. When a BID process results in a negotiated cost-sharing agreement between CD/FCCM and the school district, the MOU should be presented to the district and signed by a district designee (Authorized Signature of the School District) and the Circuit Manager or authorized designee (Approval Signature for the Children’s Division). The Authorized Signature for the Department will be obtained by the DFAS Procurement Unit. It is important that this signature line is left blank. NOTE: Contracted staff – once an MOU is signed by the school district – will submit the MOU to the local CD office for the Circuit Manager’s signature. Children’s Division will then submit the MOU to Central Office as described below. Prior to entering into an MOU with a school district, please check the Procurement Unit’s Contract Reports site to see if an MOU with that school district has already been executed and is in effect: Procurement Unit Contract Reports site Search for MOU by title – “School Transportation Reimbursement“ -utilizing the drop down menu. All approved and executed MOUs will be listed by school district. If an MOU has already been established with the school district, staff may work directly with the schools involved to complete and obtain signatures on the ESSA Individual Student Transportation Plan form (Attachment A). Reimbursement to school districts cannot occur without the MOU in effect. The original signed MOU should be sent to Central Office so it can be logged and forwarded to DFAS Procurement Unit for finalization, posting to SharePoint, and record retention. The Attachment A – Individual Student Transportation Plan is completed to document the child-specific transportation plan and cost-sharing agreement negotiated between the two agencies. The original is maintained in the child’s case record. Invoices / Reimbursement Process to School Districts: The school district must be an Unclassified (UN) Vendor. The county office will assign the district a DVN locally, if not already completed. NOTE: Please use the official school district name as listed on the DESE Missouri School Directory Interactive Map – use the Search by County tool to the right of the page. Send a UN SS-60 form along with tax documentation to DFAS FACES Payment Unit for approval and entry into FACES. The school district shall invoice CD/FCCM as outlined in Section 4.4 of the MOU. The county office will ensure all required elements for invoicing outlined in the MOU are documented on the invoice prior to payment. The invoice will be paid on a Payment Request (PR) through FACES: Program Area:  AC Vendor Type:  UN Service Code:  TRED (NA) Service Dates:  Per day, enter round trip mileage Unit Rate:  Total number of miles (CD’s cost per mile, as negotiated) Comments:  “Payment is made pursuant to ESSA – see attached agreement” Attach the invoice and a copy of the child’s completed and signed Attachment A – Individual Student Transportation Plan and send to the FACES Payment Unit. Reimbursement to Resource Provider: If the decision is made for the resource parent to provide the transportation for the child to remain in his/her school of origin, and the school district cannot or will not reimburse, mileage reimbursement will be made to the resource parent. All resource parents may receive reimbursement at the current state mileage rate for each mile traveled to and from the child’s school of origin for the day.  Level B resource parents also may be fully reimbursed for transporting the child to his/her school of origin, disregarding the mandatory 200-mile deduction.  Resource parents, however, are not paid mileage for their commute to or from their place of employment.  When transporting youth to or from their school of origin involves a shared route with the resource parent’s commute to work, only the additional mileage incurred transporting the child to the school of origin may be claimed and reimbursed.  Full mileage will be reimbursed if the resource parent did not report to work the day being claimed. Mileage will be reimbursed by completing a Payment Request in FACES using the service code TRED. The resource provider will complete the Travel Expense Log (CD-106) and submit it to the local CD staff for approval within thirty (30) days from the end of the month in which the expenses were incurred.

The BID process is initiated by the school and includes participants essential to the child’s educational and case planning.  Because Children’s Division must evaluate the child’s educational stability, the BID process is best coordinated with the child’s 72-hr FSTM upon initial removal, or Placement Stability FSTMs upon subsequent moves, since the FSTMs and the BID process include many of the same participants.  Therefore, it is imperative staff notify the child’s school immediately when the child’s initial or subsequent foster care placements may impact their current educational setting to ensure educational stability. DESE uses a BID guidance form to lead participants through a thoughtful discussion about the child’s school placement, taking into consideration a number of factors that could influence the school placement decision. Children’s Division and DESE have agreed that should the best interest determination process result in a lack of consensus, the child’s Family Support Team will make the final decision on school placement. The educational stability mandates, school of origin definition, and best interest determination process also apply to a child enrolled in a school district’s public preschool education program.

The Family Support Team shall identify and ensure appropriate interventions are in place to address the child’s educational and behavioral needs in effort to improve the child’s academic performance and educational stability. When necessary, the Family Support Team should invite appropriate school personnel to the FST meeting to determine the most appropriate interventions and/or alternative education options available to assist the child in maximizing his/her academic potential. All efforts shall be documented on the Child Assessment and Service Plan (CS-1), and the Adolescent FST Guide (CD-94).

During these discussions, the following items can help guide and inform conversations. Provide the necessary support to the resource family to involve them to meet the needs of the child and his/her parents, to include information, technical assistance, advice and counsel as follows: Assist the resource family in understanding the circumstances and behavior of the parent; Encourage the resource provider to be a model for good parenting. This will be beneficial to the foster youth and parents; and Encourage child care practices which promote and protect the psychological, physical, and emotional well-being of the child including the physical, developmental, and mental health screenings which are required every six months for children from birth to age 10 as long as the child remains in care. Discipline deserves special mention since resource providers are vulnerable to the accusation of child abuse, and many children exhibit problematic and provocative behavior. Physical punishment of foster youth is not permitted. Resource providers shall use discipline methods which are consistent with Children’s Division policy, Section 210.566, RSMo. It is crucial for children to be exposed to alternative ways of problem solving aside from force or threat of force. Limit setting is necessary in a consistent and firm way. Resource providers must be offered training to manage the behavior of the child in ways other than spanking, slapping, or hitting. Briefly, these ways include: Distraction Isolating a child in his room when he is out of control until he quiets down and can discuss things. “Time out” should be understood by both the resource provider and the child before it is used Spontaneously rewarding a child for good behavior Removing a child from dangerous situations Removing dangerous objects Explaining Specific natural or logical consequences (“If you fight with Jim, then you can’t play with him today.”) Address the following issues with child and resource family or other care provider during regular placement support contacts: Stabilization in child’s life so that development and learning can proceed at a normal rate. (Excessive anxiety and insecurity interfere with normal development and learning.) Help the child deal with the trauma of separation. Explore with him and reinforce the belief that he is not the cause of the family breakdown. Assure the healthy growth and development of the child by reviewing the child’s progress and response to care provided by the resource family, including integration any special evaluations, treatment and treatment recommendations. Give attention to the child’s special interests, talents, and vocational interests. Assist the child in rebuilding parental relationship, if the child does not want to visit. Authorization from the court must be obtained if visits with parents are to be restricted. Begin and maintain a “life book” with or for the child, to reinforce continuity in care and relationship to parents. Determine if the child has any learning or developmental needs. If needs are identified, develop a plan to address these needs in a manner that best supports the child.  Document these needs in the Social Service Plan Child Section. If such services are warranted, implement any treatment recommendations made by the physician, dentist, other professionals, and mental health professionals, including any recommendations for assisting the resource family to participate when needed.  Document these plans as next steps in the Social Service Plan Child Section. Assist the resource family to cooperate with the parent/child visiting plan: Visitation should be scheduled at a time that meets the needs of the child, the biological family members, and the resource family whenever possible. Recognizing that visitation with family members is an important right of children in foster care, resource providers shall be flexible and cooperative with regard to family visits, RSMo 210.566. Seek progress reports after each visit, if the resource providers carry out the visitation plan. Resource families must be informed that visits should never occur in homes in which a known or suspected methamphetamine laboratory exists or has existed unless it has been professionally treated or decontaminated by a hazardous waste clean-up agency according to the guidelines of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Assist the resource family in providing necessary guidance and behavior management of the child: Assess the need for elevated needs of the child. Assist the resource family and child in terminating or maintaining the relationship to family and other significant persons as desired and as appropriate to the child’s needs when the child is reunified with parents or is placed with another resource family. The resource providers shall make every effort to support and encourage the child’s placement in a permanent home, including but not limited to providing information on the history and care needs of the child and accommodating transitional visitation, Section 210.566 RSMo. Prepare the child for adoptive placement if this becomes the child’s permanency plan. Maintain healthy growth and development through the provision of the usual community health, educational, religious (if appropriate) and socialization services, including participating in normal activities. Provide the resource provider with a copy of court reports regarding the placements in their home. Explain to the resource provider they must use medical services for the foster youth placed in their home who are enrolled with MO HealthNet (MH) or MO HealthNet/Managed Care (MH/MC). Explain to the resource provider that obtaining medical services from a provider not enrolled with MO HealthNet (MH) or MO HealthNet/Managed Care (MH/MC) will result in the resource provider paying for the services out of pocket and may not be reimbursed. Any invoice or paid receipt received by the resource provider for services provided to a foster placement in their home must be submitted to the foster youth’s case manager immediately. The case manager will scan the invoice to the Medicaid Liaison at Central Office to review. If the claim cannot be paid by MH/MC, the Liaison will inform the case manager they need to utilize the Reimbursement Review process provided below.

The child’s visits with the parent(s) should become more frequent and longer in duration with increasing child care responsibility given to the parent. When the child will be with the parent for a week or longer, the Children’s Service Worker should make at least one home visit with the family during the extended visit to assure safety and provide support to the family. Provide opportunity for the parents, child, resource provider, and Children’s Service Worker to identify and resolve problems which occur during visits. The resource provider shall assist the child in making the transition to the birth family. The Children’s Service Worker and the resource provider should review the child’s life book with the child and biological parent during the transition phase of reunification.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/mo-section-4-chapter-4-working-children-subsection-1-children-placements-411-preparing-child
"MO :: Section 4, Chapter 4 (Working with Children), Subsection 1 – Children in Placements :: Intro",Missouri,Rules,"2023, 2022, 2021","Placement, Safety, Visitation",,,"Upon entry into care, the case manager must either take or obtain a photograph of each child. An updated photo should be taken at least every six (6) months for children six (6) years old or younger and then once a year for older children. An updated photo should also be taken whenever the child’s appearance changes. Staff should obtain a digital photograph whenever possible. Tips for Child Photographs : Photo should be a head-and-shoulders color photo in which the child’s face is clearly seen, similar to a school portrait. The background should be plain or solid. The child should not be overly posed. There should be no other people, animals, or objects in the photo. The photograph should be taken indoors or out of direct sunlight. Child Contact (all placements) The child’s Children’s Service Worker shall meet face-to-face, individually and jointly, with the child and the resource provider, at the placement, no later than the next business day following initial placement and any time a child changes placement during out-of-home care, including trial home visits. Arrangements may be made for someone other than the case worker to complete this visit with supervisory approval.  The case manager should then meet face-to-face with the child a minimum of one time per month with the majority of the visits being in the placement to monitor and assess the safety of the child.  The case manager is required to have at least monthly contact with the placement provider, of which the majority should be in placement setting. Examples of the majority include: If a child is in foster care for 6 months during October 1 thru September 30, 4 out of the 6 required visits during that time frame must be in the child’s placement. If a child is in foster care for only 2 months during the Federal Fiscal year, 2 visits must occur in their placement as the majority of the visits are required in that setting. If a child has been placed in a foster home for 5 months, 3 of the visits held with the provider must be in the provider’s home. The visit with the child is to continually assess: The child’s safety in the placement The child’s reaction to separation from his family The child’s perception/understanding of the problem and what he would like to see happen The child’s adjustment to placement The resource provider’s perception of the child’s adjustment to placement The Children’s Service Worker’s observation of the child’s adjustment to placement The resource provider’s response to the sibling group’s adjustment and The sibling group’s response to the resource provider. The Children Service Worker must also provide and explain the Foster Care Bill of Rights to the child during the first visit.  This explanation should be done at a developmentally appropriate level and the case manager can include the foster parent or other support to the child in the discussion if needed. Each visit should be of a high quality. Visits should be purposeful and provide a chance for the worker to engage with the child.  Some characteristics of a high quality visit include: Good Communication Informing the child on the status of the case (events, goals, dates) Asking what the child wants (getting the child’s voice) Speaking with the child alone Responding timely to previous requests The Division has the authority to provide services to a child and parent when the child is not in custody but is under court ordered supervision by the Division. This includes visiting with the child. Face-to-face visits in the home should be done no less than once a month or more as needed to assure the safety of the child and to achieve the case goal. Assessing Safety in the Placement Safety of the resource home should be assessed to ensure the placement provides the necessary support to the child. The resource family should be engaged to involve them in meeting the needs of the child and his/her parents. The following activities can help ensure this occurs: Assist the resource family in understanding the circumstances and behavior of the parent Encourage the resource provider to be a model for good parenting. This will be beneficial to the foster youth and parents Encourage child care practices which promote and protect the psychological, physical, and emotional well-being of the child Ensure the placement resource understands the Division’s restriction on use of physical punishment The Children’s Service Worker and placement provider will discuss: The child’s adjustment The child’s reaction to visits The child’s behavioral, emotional/mental, trauma history, education, dental and physical concerns, progress or needs. The child’s educational and developmental progress The child’s loss and grief issues Any unmet needs identified in the Social Service Plan Parent’s progress in resolving identified risk factors and safety concerns Resource provider’s adjustment to the child’s placement Additional services necessary to maintain the placement Any new needs not already identified in the Social Service Plan Child Section Any progress made toward addressing previously identified needs in the Social Service Plan Child Section Next steps to address any ongoing or newly identified needs of the child Next steps in determining ability of child to be reunited with siblings, after therapist recommendation If the child is placed in a residential setting, safety should still be assured by meeting with facility staff and discussing progress and plans for the child at least monthly.

"MO :: Section 4, Chapter 3 (Court)",Missouri,Rules,"2023, 2022, 2021","Adoption, Child rights, Court system, Legal process, Permanency, Termination of parental rights",,,"Court Related Activities Children’s Service Workers may be expected to prepare reports and/or testify at a variety of court hearings in both family/juvenile court and civil courts. These hearings may include adjudication, dispositional, permanency reviews, adoptions, dissolution of marriage and criminal matters. Guidelines for preparing for court, preparing the family for court, preparing court reports, and testifying in court are provided below. The Children’s Service Worker shall prepare and submit a report for the court that includes a description of the facts pertaining to the case, any updates on progress or lack of progress made towards the safety goals, any relevant changes to the family situation, the recommended permanency and concurrent plan for each child, and any recommendations made by the Family Support Team.  The worker shall complete the Social Service Plan in its entirety in preparation for review by the court and all additional parties to the case.  The specific requirements and timeframes for submission to the court and additional parties may vary in each circuit.  The Social Service Plan must be developed within 30 days of the date a case is opened for ongoing services, and the process for service planning is expedited when a crisis or urgent need is identified.  A copy of the Social Service Plan shall be provided to all parties of the case upon completion. The court process may place the Children’s Service Worker in an adversarial position or may be an opportunity to advocate for the family. The worker is expected to work with the family to improve the family’s ability to provide a safe environment for the child. The following guidelines will assist the worker in preparing the family for court: Review with the family and the child, if age appropriate, the safety concerns involved in the situation Review with the family their progress in achieving the treatment plan Review their legal rights, referring them to an attorney if needed Describe the agency’s role in the court hearing Assist the family (including the child and other family members) in dealing with their feelings about the court action Explain the possible outcomes of the court hearing Prepare the child for what to expect if he/she is to testify. Explain that the child should answer truthfully and answer only those questions to which he/she knows the answer. Assure the child that he/she is not to blame for the necessity of the hearing. Explain that the judge is there to make a determination as to what is best for the child. The Children’s Service Worker should contact the attorney (or juvenile officer acting in this role) who represents the court’s interests if he/she is not contacted prior to the hearing. The following questions and concepts may be important for a clear understanding of how to testify and what to expect at the court hearing: Sometimes it is helpful to show the child the inside of the courtroom before the hearing to orient him/her to the surroundings such as where participants will be sitting. Role-playing may also be helpful to the child. The Children’s Service Worker should contact the attorney (or juvenile officer acting in this role) who represents the court’s interests if he/she is not contacted prior to the hearing. The following questions and concepts may be important for a clear understanding of how to testify and what to expect at the court hearing: What type of hearing is scheduled? (i.e. adjudication, disposition, permanency, review, adoption, guardianship) Court setting – how formal or informal is the court? Will there be testimony? What are the qualifications needed and what are the topics? What is the Guardian Ad Litem (GAL)’s position/role? Does the court want the case file brought to the hearing? How is evidence submitted and reviewed? In any judicial proceeding involving the custody of a child, the fact that a child abuse and neglect report may have been made pursuant to Sections 210.110 to 210.165, RSMo. shall not be admissible. However, this shall not prohibit the introduction of evidence from independent sources to support the allegations that may have caused a report to have been made (Section 210.145, RSMo). These guidelines are provided to assist the Children’s Service Worker during the hearing: Dress appropriately and professionally. How you present yourself to the court impacts on your credibility Listen carefully to the attorney’s questions Be as specific as possible with answers to the attorney’s questions If you don’t understand a question, you did not hear it, or you do not know the answer, say so. Ask that the question be repeated or rephrased if necessary On cross-examination remember two things: Always answer only what you are asked by the opposing attorney. Do not volunteer information. It is the opposing attorney’s job to ask the questions and get the answers he/she feels will benefit his/her position. If you want to explain an answer, ask if you may explain. If the opposing attorney says no, you have at least alerted your own attorney to request an explanation or redirect Always pause for a few seconds to give your attorney time to object to the question if he/she desires. If you provide an answer which is detrimental to your case and an objection could have been made, the court may allow the answer to be stricken; however everyone will have heard it. If you are asked a question by the opposing attorney and your attorney objects, do not say anything until the judge has ruled. Sometimes the attorneys will both present explanations for their positions. The judge will either sustain the objection, which means you do not have to answer the question, or the judge will overrule the objection, which means you do have to answer Juvenile Court Information Purpose and Mission of the Court As designated by the Juvenile Code, the purpose of the juvenile court is to “facilitate the care, protection and discipline of children who come within the jurisdiction of the Juvenile Court.”  The Code also states that the law should be “liberally construed” which permits a great deal of discretionary power. Based on the law, the mission of the court is to ensure that “each child coming within the jurisdiction of the Juvenile Court shall receive such care, guidance and control, preferably in his own home, as will conduce to the child’s welfare and the best interests of the state…” Jurisdiction of the Court The juvenile court has exclusive jurisdiction over children under 18 years of age. Once the juvenile court has asserted jurisdiction, the court may retain jurisdiction until the child has reached the age of twenty-one. Its authority over adults is limited to the following circumstances: The court may order parents to financially support their children in placement; The court may order the parent to participate in services Any person who interferes with a court order, or contributes to the delinquency of a child under the court’s jurisdiction may be held in contempt The termination of parental rights Adoption The Hearing Process A series of hearings will be held by the court. The types of hearings which the court may hold include: Protective Custody Hearings- These are held to determine if the court has grounds to hold the child until the adjudicatory hearing. The hearing must be held within 72 hours excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. Adjudication and Dispositional Hearings- These two hearings may be addressed consecutively in the same hearing or separately in two hearings.  The Adjudicatory hearing is conducted to determine if the juvenile or his parents have committed acts alleged in the petition which then allows the court to take jurisdiction over the child. If the allegations are found to be true, the hearing enters phase two, the Dispositional phase. In the dispositional phase, the court decides the legal and physical custody of the juvenile, and whether the Children’s Division is required to engage in reasonable efforts to reunify the family and, if so, the reasonable efforts necessary to effect reunification. Dispositional Review Hearing – This hearing should be held within 90 days of the Dispositional Hearing and may be held as often as needed to determine the attempts of the Children’s Division to locate all biological parents; efforts of Children’s Division to reunify the family, and whether those efforts have been reasonable; the compliance of the parties with the Social Service Plan and any court-ordered services; whether Children’s Division is required to continue to engage in efforts to reunify the family; recommendations of the Children’s Division and juvenile officer; and the recommendations of the guardian ad litem and court appointed special advocate. Permanency Hearing – These are judicial reviews held annually that are conducted to enter an order for the legal and physical custody of the juvenile and, if awarding legal and physical custody of the juvenile to a parent, guardian or custodian, relieve the Children’s Division of custody, and if appropriate, terminate jurisdiction; continue or, as appropriate, modify the Social Service Plan and any court ordered services; determine and make findings on the efforts of the Children’s Division to finalize the permanency plan in effect for the juvenile and whether those efforts have been reasonable; determine and, in accordance with the best interests of the juvenile, order: the permanency plan that is most appropriate for the juvenile; and the reasonable efforts required of the Children’s Division to finalize the permanency plan that is most appropriate for the juvenile; and schedule a permanency review hearing. Permanency Review Hearing – This hearing may be held as often as is necessary, but must be held at least every 6 months following the permanency hearing. The purpose of this hearing is to determine if the permanency plan in place is the most appropriate option for the child and whether the Children’s Division has made reasonable efforts to finalize the plan. Residential Treatment Placement Hearings – This type of hearing may be required in the event that a youth is placed, or may be placed, in a residential treatment setting requiring review by a qualified independent assessor.  At this hearing, the court assesses the report by the independent assessor and makes a finding regarding the appropriateness and need for placement as further explain in Section 4, Chapter 2 (Placements), Subsection 3 – Residential and Department of Mental Health Developmental Disabilities Placements. Termination of Parental Rights (TPR) Hearings – This is a legal proceeding which considers the need to sever the legal ties of a child from his/her parents.  In other types of hearings, the Juvenile Code states that the law should be “liberally construed.”  This permits a great deal of discretionary power. However, appellate courts in Missouri have repeatedly stated that in an action for termination of parental rights the statutory requirements will be strictly and literally applied. Adoption Hearings – This is a legal proceeding that considers a petition to adopt a child, determines the suitability of the prospective adoptive family, and grants temporary or final legal custody of a child for the purpose of adoption. As with TPR proceedings, the adoption statutes will also be strictly construed. Special Hearings – Other matters heard by the court upon a petition by the parent, guardian, legal custodian, spouse, relative or next friend. This includes hearings for which a guardianship could be ordered. Witnesses and Records When the Juvenile Officer or other party files a petition or motion with the court, at times the juvenile and/or parent will deny the allegations. When this occurs, a contested hearing is set and witnesses are subpoenaed. Witnesses may include school personnel, medical personnel, the police, Children’s Division (CD) staff, etc. In order to introduce evidence contained in the records of these witnesses, it must be done under the Uniform Business Records Act. This is an exception to the Hearsay Rule. In order to comply with the Act it is necessary that: The custodian testifies to the identity and mode of preparation of the record; The custodian testifies that it was made in the regular course of business at or near the time of the act; and Sources, method, and time for the preparation of the record justify admission at the discretion of the court. These records may also be admissible without the testimony of the custodian if they are filed with the proper affidavit. Supreme Court Rule 123.08 requires the Children’s Division and the Juvenile Office to provide access to records and information within specific time frames without a formal discovery request. Within ten (10) days of the protective custody hearing or within fourteen (14) days of the filing of the petition or motion to modify, the Children’s Division and juvenile officer must allow for certain records to be made available to all parties. The records may include the following and should be relevant to the allegations in the petition: Medical records of the juvenile Law enforcement records, including incident reports. If information regarding an active investigation is requested, CD staff should request permission to release from law enforcement. If law enforcement will not approve the release due to an active investigation, CD should notify all parties that the information cannot be released at this time Written statements, videotapes, and audiotapes regarding the juvenile and/or parents/guardians Reports and affidavits submitted by the Children’s Division to the juvenile office recommending protective custody or a petition to be filed Completed CD reports and safety plans Social Service Plan Completed hotline reports, redacted as required by law. If the hotline report is not completed by the timeframes set forth in the initial court hearing, the report should be made available upon completion CD must also make available to all parties any new relevant information related to the allegations obtained within ten (10) days of receipt. This rule only requires CD to make available completed documents in their case record. The rule does not require CD to request additional records not currently in its possession for any other party. Staff are not required to have a release of information form signed by the parents to release information related to the allegations pursuant to a request made under this rule as long as there is an order of appointment by the court or entry of appearance made by the attorney. However, a signed release of information form is required to release confidential materials regarding the parents’ protected health information or materials not covered in the rule. The rule states that CD must make these materials available for all parties, thus staff should have their case files ready for review within the specified timeframes. The rule does not require CD to make copies of the information. Staff may schedule an appointment for the party to review the relevant information in the record. If the party or attorney would like copies of the documents, they may provide a written or verbal request. If copies of the information are requested, the Children’s Division must follow the timeframes established in this rule as this rule supersedes the CD policy regarding these timeframes. Only one copy per party will be made. Any additional copies will be made at the expense of the person requesting the copy. The Expert Witness CD staff may be required to testify in court, either to the facts of a case or in the role of an expert witness. Opinions and inferences of an expert witness are admissible when it has been established that the witness is professionally acquainted with, skilled, or trained in some field (i.e., child welfare, child custody) and therefore has knowledge or experience in matters generally not familiar to the public. For this reason, prior to testimony, CD staff may be asked to state their educational background, experience, etc. While CD staff may testify to matters which pertain to “the best interests of the child,” they are generally not qualified to testify to matters beyond their scope of expertise such as medical opinions, mental condition/diagnosis of the parent, etc. Legal Rights Certain legal rights in terms of the integrity of the family have been established by the Supreme Court via the process of legislative review. In general, these rights have been incorporated into state statutes. Such rights include, but are not limited to: Constitutional Rights – Applied to both parents and children. Parents have the constitutional right to rear their children as they see fit provided the child’s general welfare is protected. Right to Counsel – In almost all instances, children have a right to counsel and/or a Guardian ad Litem. A Guardian ad Litem (GAL) is an adult individual appointed by a court to protect the best interests of a minor child in a specific legal action and may be, but is not necessarily, an attorney. In order to be appointed as a GAL the individual must have completed a training program in permanency planning. Under Missouri laws an indigent parent is entitled to have an attorney appointed in actions for termination of parental rights. In cases of child abuse or neglect, where the parent is a minor, mentally ill, or incompetent, the parent is entitled to appointment of a GAL. Right to an Impartial Hearing – Before children can be removed from a home, parents and children have the right to a hearing before an impartial judge, except in emergency situations. Right of Family Integrity – Before removal of a child, attempts should be made to strengthen and rehabilitate the family. Therefore, courts will generally support a preference for the child to remain in the natural home. Right to Challenge, Correct and Expunge Child Protection Agency Records – This encompasses the destruction of unsubstantiated CA/N reports on reports made prior to August 28, 1999 (Section 210.150, RSMo. removed court expungement of unsubstantiated reports) the right to review CD records, and the right to challenge CD findings in court. Rights of the Child and Family The court is empowered to protect “the best interests of the child.”  In this context, the court will place substantial weight on the following considerations: Love, affection, and emotional ties existing between parent and child Presumption that natural parents have an inherent capacity and interest to best provide love, affection, and guidance, and the right to make educational, medical, disciplinary, and religious choices for the child Length of time the child has resided with the parents and desirability of maintaining continuity Financial resources of parents are of secondary importance, provided basic necessities can be met with or without the assistance of outside resources Parental Responsibilities The integrity of the family is protected by both legal and ethical rights. Parents have responsibilities as well as rights. When the welfare of the child is endangered, the state assumes the right to intervene. Within their ability and available resources, parents have a responsibility to provide: Food, shelter, clothing Medical care Educational opportunities Supervision Moral and social guidance.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/mo-section-4-chapter-3-court
"MO :: Section 4, Chapter 2 (Placements), Subsection 11 – ICPC :: 2.11.9 Other Interstate Compacts",Missouri,Rules,"2023, 2022","Administrative process, Adoption, Legal process, Placement, Services while in care - Educational, Services while in care - Medical",,,"Interstate Compact on Adoption and Medical Assistance (ICAMA ) The Interstate Compact on Adoption and Medical Assistance (ICAMA), Sections 453.500-453.503 RSMo requires states to provide Medicaid coverage to eligible adoption subsidy children when families move across state lines. A child who is eligible for Title IV-E benefits is automatically eligible to receive Medicaid in the receiving state. However, a child who receives state-funded adoption assistance does not automatically qualify for Medicaid in the receiving state unless the sending state has a reciprocal agreement with the receiving state to provide state health care services. MO HealthNet services will be opened on all children who move from any state with an adoption subsidy agreement (full reciprocity for IV-E and state only adoption subsidy which meet eligibility requirements). The Compact Administrator (Division Director) and Deputy Compact Administrator (Interstate Unit Program Manager) are designated in each member state and approved by the national ICAMA Office. ICAMA Coordinators work together with Coordinators in other states to process the required paperwork so Medicaid eligibility can be established in the adoptive family’s current residence state. All states except Wyoming are members of ICAMA. The territories of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands are also non-members. In 2015, AAICAMA developed an electronic submission process to be used by all member states to transmit ICAMA referrals across the country. This system is referred to as “blueiron”. In MO, all adoption subsidy workers are responsible for entering ICAMA referrals as necessary on their subsidy cases. Missouri as the Sending State When a child/adoptive family has moved from Missouri to another state, the adoption subsidy worker will: Update the Alternative Care (AC) Client Information Screen/Placement Information to show new address of adoptive family and the county as “999”. This code identifies the child as being placed out of state. The subsidy worker will then log into blueiron (on line ICAMA database) and enter a new referral and upload the subsidy paperwork for each child. A step by step guide is located on the Children’s Division Intranet, under Interstate Compact. NOTE: There is a check box labeled “ICAMA Indicator” on the AC Client Information Screen. DO NOT mark this box. This box is for Central Office Use only . Missouri as the Receiving State MO ICAMA Coordinator will process incoming referrals as they are received through the blueiron network. Open a vendor license in PROD for the adoptive parents and assign a DCN to the child/ren if they are not already in the PROD/FACES systems; Open the AC Client Information Function in FACES or update if the child(ren) is already in the system to show that ICAMA Medicaid is opened for the child(ren) Request a MO HealthNet card for the child/ren to be sent to the new Missouri residence. The case will be opened for MO HealthNet services only and will display the assigned ICAMA Coordinator as the case manager. The child/ren’s adoption subsidy state (where the adoption subsidy contract originated) will remain responsible for maintenance and other special expenses under the terms of the adoption subsidy agreement. Compact Termination/Closure Compact termination or closure can occur under one of the following circumstances: The child reaches the age of majority (18 years) and the adoption subsidy is not extended by the subsidy originator state The family moves back to the sending state or The child becomes self-supporting. Upon one of these circumstances occurring, the adoption subsidy worker is to enter in blueiron a change of status and forward to the receiving state’s ICAMA office to notify them of case closure in their state. Interstate Compact on Juveniles The Interstate Compact on Juveniles (ICJ), Section 210.570-210.590 RSMo, pertains to children who have been declared delinquent. The ICJ is administered in Missouri by the Division of Youth Services (DYS). The Children’s Division must honor this compact for any child in its custody or when providing any services to a child who comes under the jurisdiction of the court for delinquent behavior. Interstate Compact on Mental Health The Interstate Compact on Mental Health (ICMH), Sections 630.810-630.835, RSMo, pertains to persons who have been declared mentally ill or deficient. The ICMH is administered by the Department of Mental Health (DMH). Placements of children are made only from DMH administered state institutions or other medical facilities to a similar facility in another state. Interstate Compact on Educational Opportunity for Military Children The Interstate Compact on Educational Opportunity for Military Children, Section 160.2000, RSMo., makes provisions for children of families serving in the military by allowing greater opportunities for military children to meet Missouri’s educational requirements. The Compact commissioner responsible for the administration and management of the state’s participation in the Compact shall be appointed by the Governor. Some of the Compact’s 18 Articles which could impact Children’s Division case management are listed below: ARTICLE III The provisions of the Compact shall apply only to local education agencies and to the children of active duty military members or veterans (including the National Guard or Reserve) who are severely injured, medically discharged, retired from service, or died on active duty or as a result of injuries sustained on active duty, for a period of one (1) year after discharge, retirement or death. ARTICLE IV Unofficial or “hand-carried” education records—In the event that official education records cannot be released to the parents for the purpose of transfer, the custodian of the records in the sending state shall prepare and furnish to the parent a complete set of unofficial educational records. The school in the receiving state shall enroll and appropriately place the student based on the information provided in the unofficial records pending validation by the official records, as quickly as possible. Official records/transcripts—Simultaneous with the enrollment and conditional placement of the student, the school in the receiving state shall request the student’s official education record from the school in the sending state. The sending state will process and furnish the official records within ten days or within such time as is reasonably determined under the Compact. Immunizations—Compacting states shall give thirty (30) days from the date of enrollment or within such time as is reasonably determined to obtain any immunization(s) required by the receiving state. Kindergarten/First grade entrance age—Students shall be allowed to continue their enrollment at grade level in the receiving state commensurate with their grade level (including kindergarten) from a local education agency in the sending state at the time of transition, regardless of age. A student that has satisfactorily completed the prerequisite grade level in the local education agency in the sending state, shall be eligible for enrollment in the next highest grade level in the receiving state, regardless of age. ARTICLE V Absences as related to deployment activities—Students whose parent or legal guardian is an active duty member of the uniformed services and has been called to duty for, is on leave from, or immediately returned from deployment to a combat zone or combat support posting, shall be granted additional excused absences at the discretion of the local education agency superintendent to visit with his or her parent or legal guardian relative to such leave or deployment of the parent or guardian. ARTICLE VI A local education agency shall be prohibited from charging local tuition to a transitioning military child in the care of a noncustodial parent or other person standing in loco parentis who lives in a jurisdiction other than that of the custodial parent. The transitioning military child, placed in the care of a non-custodial parent or other person standing in loco parentis who lives in another jurisdiction other than that of the custodial parent, may continue to attend the school in which he/she was enrolled while residing with the custodial parent.

"MO :: Section 4, Chapter 2 (Placements), Subsection 11 – ICPC :: 2.11.8 Border Agreement",Missouri,Rules,"2023, 2022","Administrative process, Placement, Reporting requirements, Services while in care - Medical",,,"Missouri and Kansas have developed a Border Agreement (BA) to address barriers within the interstate placement process. In accordance with Missouri Statute RSMo 210.622, the BA allows expedited emergency placement with a relative caregiver or licensed facility (i.e. emergency shelter, residential facility including, but not limited to, a psychiatric residential treatment facility) located within 60 miles of the states’ border. The BA defines relative as “a grandparent or any other person related to another by blood or affinity or a person who is not so related to the child but has a close relationship with the child or the child’s family.” This definition is to be used in determining eligibility of a proposed caregiver for border agreement placement. Once placement is made, caregivers must also meet Kansas’ statutory definition of relative to be eligible for consideration of an unlicensed relative placement. Relative providers that do not meet this definition will be required to be licensed as a foster home by Kansas for continued placement. Placement Procedure Prior to making a BA emergency placement with a relative caregiver, the “Required Actions for Placement” listed in the Child Welfare Manual Section 6, Chapter 16, and Subsection 2.1 must be completed. This includes an in person safety walkthrough to complete the Resource Home Safety Checklist (CS-45) and the following Kansas background screenings : Kansas Child Abuse and Neglect Registry (CANIS) Kansas Bureau of Investigation Name Based Check (KBI) An address search of the National Sex Offender Public Website – United States Department of Justice National Sex Offender Public Website (nsopw.gov) If a relative or household member living in Kansas has previously resided within Missouri, the following additional screenings must be completed prior to placement: Missouri Child Abuse and Neglect Missouri Case.net Missouri Sex Offender The “Required Actions Following Placement” listed in the Child Welfare Manual Section 6, Chapter 16, subsection 2.2 should be followed for relatives accepting border agreement placements. The only exception to these actions is relative licensure requirements. Kansas will complete any required or requested licensing for relatives pursuing licensure. Financial and Medical Planning A Departmental Vendor Number (DVN) should be assigned to the relative placement provider if one does not already exist. A relative foster home application should be opened for the purpose of placement. Monthly maintenance will be automatically generated for 90 days to relative providers who choose to pursue licensure which should be indicated on the application. Relatives will not be eligible for additional maintenance until they have completed licensure with Kansas. In order for children to receive Title IVE Medicaid in a receiving state, the child must be IVE Eligible, placed in a licensed foster home, and receiving maintenance. Children are not eligible for Kansas Medicaid during the temporary placement of a Border Agreement. Children may continue to receive Missouri Medicaid or the relative may choose to apply for Kansas Medicaid. Children may not receive Medicaid in both states simultaneously. In order for Missouri Medicaid to remain active during out of state placement, please contact MO_ICPC@dss.mo.gov . Missouri Children’s Division remains financially responsible for meeting all of the child’s needs as long as child remains in Missouri CD custody. Post Placement Activities Within 48 hours of placement, a notification email must be sent to MO_ICPC@dss.mo.gov with the name and DCN of each child placed, the proposed placement provider’s name and address, and if the child will need to continue receiving Missouri Medicaid. Within 30 days of placement, a fully completed ICPC Regulation 2 referral must be submitted. Border agreement placements are ineligible for ICPC Regulation 7 or Expedited Placement referral due to placement having already occurred. Missouri must continue to provide supervision to include monthly, in-person visitation with the child in their placement until the ICPC home assessment is completed and a recommendation for or against continued placement is received by Kansas. If Kansas does not recommend continued placement following the completion of an ICPC home study, the case manager will have 5 business days to return the child to the state of Missouri. Kansas Placements Policy and procedure regarding placement of a Kansas youth in Missouri has been developed by Kansas in partnership with Missouri.

The primary application of this regulation is to request approval to place prior to placement at the residential facility. If the child is placed prior to approval being received, this is considered a violation of the Compact. The receiving state is not obligated to process and approve the placement request as long as the child is placed in violation of the Compact. Types of Placements Exempt from Regulation 4 Regulation 4 does not apply when placement is sought in the following facilities across state lines: A primarily educational institution defined under Regulation 4 as an institution that operates one or more programs that can be offered in satisfaction of compulsory school attendance laws, in which the primary purpose of accepting children is to meet their educational needs . A hospital or other medical facility defined as an institution for the acutely ill that discharges its patients when they are no longer acutely ill, which does not provide or hold itself out as providing child care in substitution for parental and/or foster care, and in which a child is placed for the primary purpose of treating an acute medical problem. An institution for the mentally ill or developmentally disabled minors means a facility that is responsible for treatment of acute conditions, both psychiatric and medical, as well as such custodial care as is necessary for the treatment of such acute conditions of minors who are either voluntarily committed or involuntarily committed by a court of competent jurisdiction to reside in it; Outpatient services provided for the treatment, care, and other services by an institution for the mentally ill or developmentally disabled may accept a child for treatment and care without complying with ICPC. Missouri as the Sending State All ICPC Referrals are to be entered in FACES. When making a request for a residential placement in another state, the Children’s Service Worker will submit the same documentation as for any other type of home study request through ICPC. In addition to the documentation listed above, the following documentation is to be included: Letter of acceptance from the residential facility. This provides the receiving state’s ICPC office with indication that the residential facility has screened the child as an appropriate placement for their facility. Placement Disruption Agreement which indicates who will be responsible for the return of the child to the sending state if the child disrupts or a request is made for the child’s removal and return to the sending state.

Placement of a Missouri Child in a Residential Care Facility in another State Once approval is received, and the child is placed, the Children’s Service Worker is to complete the ICPC 100B, Report on Child Placement Status. This form is to be signed and submitted to Missouri ICPC. For placements in a residential facility in another state, the residential facility is viewed as the agency responsible for the twenty four (24) hour care of a child away from the child’s parental home. In that capacity the residential facility is responsible for the supervision, protection, safety, and well-being of the child.  The sending agency making the placement is expected to enter into an agreement with the residential facility as to the program plan or expected level of supervision and treatment and the frequency and nature of any written progress or treatment reports. For children placed in residential facilities in another state, the receiving state’s local child welfare workers and probation staff are not expected to provide any monitoring or supervision.

Regulation 11 clarifies the supervisory role of the assigned worker in the receiving state once placement is made through an approved ICPC home study. The supervising worker in the receiving state is to provide the following services. Please note, this is not an all-inclusive list. Each case is different and will require different approaches and services. The Children’s Service Worker assigned to complete the initial home study will: Receive the placement request from the ICPC Coordinator in Central Office. Any request received directly from a sending agency must be forwarded to Central Office. Do not complete an assessment, home study, or walkthrough without a referral from Central Office. Walkthroughs are outside the scope of the ICPC. Complete and return the results of the requested preliminary home assessment. Guide for Conducting Resource Provider Assessments, within 60 calendar days to the ICPC unit in Central Office pursuant to Public Law 109-239. The preliminary home assessment does not require the training component or FBI checks, but should evaluate the safety and suitability of placing a child in the prospective relative, foster or adoptive home. Staff will then proceed with completing the home study. The home study must address the extent to which the proposed placement will meet the specific needs of the child, including the child’s safety, permanency and well-being.   FBI background checks are required. If the request is for licensure, then the training component must be completed. Please refer to Memorandum CD07-60 regarding the acceptance of pre service training for resource providers who have moved to Missouri from other states. Staff will then make a recommendation in FACES under Referral in the Case Management screen using the Call/Case number provided by the ICPC unit on the transmittal. If the recommendation by the home study worker is against placement and the resource wishes to contest that recommendation, then staff are directed to follow the Children’s Division Fair Hearing Process. Complete the Vendor Licensure/Approval and Renewal screen in FACES, if the receiving state requests the family to be licensed. The sending state is not obligated to make a payment to the family if the sending state did not request a licensing study. Missouri resource providers are not entitled to receive the Professional Parenting maintenance payment when they accept children from another state. The foster/adoptive home study must be completed and submitted to the ICPC unit in Central Office within 90 calendar days after the State received the original request. The Children’s Service Worker should submit the original and 2 copies of the completed home study along with a recommendation for or against placement. The ICPC Coordinator will make the decision whether or not the placement is approved. DO NOT send the information directly to the requesting state’s worker or to the requesting state’s ICPC office. If Missouri is the Sending Agency and is going to make a maintenance payment to the resource provider should the placement be approved, a foster home study should be requested regardless of the degree of relationship. The home study is not “official” until the ICPC Coordinator in the receiving state has made a determination for or against the placement. The above procedure does not apply to parents and unlicensed relatives . Parents and unlicensed relatives will go through the same home study process as an applicant applying for licensure, which is clarified in Memorandum CD04-63 and in the Child Welfare Manual. The differences are that parents and unlicensed relatives are not required to complete training, and the time frame pursuant to Public Law 109-239 for completing their assessment/home study is 60 days. The assigned county will, upon notification of placement via the ICPC 100B, from the MO ICPC coordinator: Complete the Alternative Care Client screen in FACES, for relative foster care, foster, or adoptive placements, or the Family-Centered Services Case screen in FACES, for a parent or non-licensed relative placement and notify ICPC Central Office of the assigned Children’s Service Worker and supervisor Supervision/contact is to be made/initiated as soon as the receiving state is made aware that the child/ren have been placed; Cooperate in arranging services for the family; Determine with verification from the sending state, if the child is eligible for Title IV-E Medicaid; and Open Title IV-E Medicaid if the family is licensed and receiving payment from the sending state. Refer to Child Welfare Manual for more information regarding ICAMA. Provide services accordingly to include: The worker who completed the home study should provide a copy of the initial referral and home study to the worker who has been assigned to supervise the placement. Prepare written quarterly progress reports and submit the original and two (2) copies to ICPC Central Office. At a minimum, these reports are to include: Date and location of each face-to-face contact with the child since the last report was submitted; A summary of the child’s current circumstances, including on-going safety & well-being; A summary of the child’s academic performance along with any pertinent documentation (i.e. Report card, IEP, etc); A summary of child’s current health status, including mental health and copies of any pertinent therapeutic or medical reports; An assessment of the current placement/ caretakers and their continued appropriateness as a placement for child/ren; A description of any unmet needs and any recommendations for meeting identified needs. When applicable, the supervising worker’s recommendation regarding continuation of placement, return or legal custody to a parent/s and termination of the sending state’s jurisdiction, finalization of adoption by child’s current caretakers or the granting of legal guardianship to the child’s current caretakers. Placement supervision is for a minimum of six (6) months. If there is a hotline on the proposed placement and/or involving the child/ren placed through ICPC, the supervising worker is to follow their agency protocols for ensuring the safety of the child/ren. If the child/ren must be removed, the supervising worker does so and then notifies the sending state as well as the receiving state’s ICPC office. The sending state remains the financially responsible party for the child/ren and is responsible for all case management decisions. The receiving state assists in locating services to meet the needs of the child/ren and the placement resource. The sending state worker should be notified prior to any financial decision being made on behalf of the child (i.e.: residential treatment etc). Written verification MUST be received from the sending state that they are in agreement to and will be financially responsible for payment of the identified service prior to the initiation of the service. If it is determined that ICPC services are not appropriate, the Missouri ICPC Coordinator should be informed immediately. Notify the ICPC Coordinator in Central Office as soon as possible if the child is returned. Send the ICPC 100-B to close out the ICPC case, if a disruption may, or has occurred.

This process is as follows. The sending state may request reversal of the denial within ninety (90) days from the date the ICPC 100A was signed as denied by the receiving state’s ICPC office. The request can be with or without a new home study as outlined below.  After 90 days, there is nothing that precludes the sending state from requesting a new home study. Request reconsideration without a new home study. The sending ICPC office can request that the receiving state’s ICPC office reconsider the denial of placement. If the receiving state’s ICPC office chooses to overturn the denial, it can be based on review of the new information or clarification of information provided by the sending state’s ICPC office. Request new home study re-examining reasons for original denial: A sending ICPC office may send a new ICPC home study request if the reason for denial has been corrected (i.e. move to new residence with adequate bedrooms). The receiving state’s ICPC office is not obligated to activate the new home study request, but it may agree to proceed with a new home study to reconsider the denial decision if it believes the reasons for denial have been corrected. This regulation shall not conflict with any appeal process otherwise available in the receiving state.

TFC is a specialized program for children with significant emotional or behavioral needs, who, with additional resources, can remain in a family setting and achieve positive growth and development.  TFC services are provided by agencies contracted with the Division to develop and oversee Treatment Foster homes.  These contracted agencies shall meet all TFC program specifications outlined in their contract. TFC programs provide services to youth with severe behavioral disorders, psychiatric diagnoses, delinquency, and symptoms of complex trauma. TFC exists to serve children and youth whose special needs are severe enough that in the absence of such programs, they would be at risk of placement into restrictive residential settings such as hospitals, psychiatric centers, correctional facilities, or residential treatment programs. Individualized treatment refers to the coordinated provision of services and use of procedures designed to produce a planned outcome in a person’s behavior, attitude, or general condition based on a thorough assessment of possible contributing factors. Because treatment is individualized, each child, youth, and family receives flexible services over time to meet their changing needs. Treatment typically involves teaching adaptive, pro-social skills and responses that equip young people and their families with the means to deal effectively with the unique conditions or individual circumstances that have created the need for treatment. The term “individualized treatment” presumes stated, measurable goals based on a professional assessment, a set of written procedures for achieving those goals, and a process for assessing the results. Treatment accountability requires that goals and objectives be time-limited and outcomes systematically monitored. The TFC parents are trained and supported by their contracted agency to implement key elements of treatment in the context of the family and community life while promoting the goals of permanency planning for youth in their care. Each therapeutic foster home and child is assigned a TFC worker with the primary responsibility for the development of treatment plans. The TFC worker also provides support and consultation to the TFC foster parents, to families of children in care, to children enrolled in the TFC program, and to other treatment team members. The TFC worker coordinates activities to ensure children and families receive needed services according to their treatment plan.

Send the completed assessment to the RCST Coordinator, Circuit Manager, Supervisor, and Case Manager using a secure mode of transmittal. The purpose of the Independent Assessment will be to assess the strengths and needs of the child using an age-appropriate, evidence-based, validated, functional assessment tool.  The assessment will be in writing, and will determine whether the needs of the child can be met with family members or through placement in a foster family home or, if not, which setting would provide the most effective and appropriate level of care for the child in the least restrictive environment and be consistent with the short- and long-term goals for the child, as specified in the permanency plan for the child. If the Independent Assessor determines the child should not be placed in a foster family home , he/she must specify in writing: The reasons why the child’s needs can’t be met by the family or in a foster family home (a shortage of foster family homes is not an acceptable reason for determining the child’s needs cannot be met in a foster family home); and Why the recommended placement in a residential treatment setting is the setting that will provide the child with the most effective and appropriate level of care in the least restrictive environment; and How the setting is consistent with the short- and long-term goals for the child, as specified in the permanency plan for the child.

Redactions may be necessary to protect information that is confidential as a matter of law, or may be harmful to the best interests, safety, and welfare of the child. Ask the court to assess the appropriateness for the child to be placed or remain in a residential treatment setting as described below. The Case Manager may need the assistance of DLS (such as preparing a motion) in order to trigger action by the court. In the event that after 15 calendar days after being sent the report, the court has not made a written finding to approve or disapprove the recommendations of the Independent Assessor’s report, the Case Manager shall complete a referral to DLS, attaching the Independent Assessor’s report. When conducting an assessment of appropriateness for the child to be placed or remain in a residential treatment setting, the Division shall ask the court to make specific written findings of fact and : Consider the assessment, determination, and documentation made by the qualified individual conducting the assessment; Determine whether the needs of the child can be met through placement in a foster home or, if not, whether placement of the child in a residential treatment setting provides the most effective and appropriate level of care for the child, in the least restrictive environment; Determine whether that placement is consistent with the short-term and long term goals for the child, as specified in the permanency plan for the child; and Approve or disapprove the placement setting recommended by the Independent Assessor’s report. Such approval or disapproval must be documented in the case plan, and uploaded to OnBase. In the event the court disapproves the placement, the Division shall seek placement in another setting, consistent with the findings of the Independent Assessor’s report. Note: This written finding shall be made within 60 days of the child’s placement in the residential treatment setting.  It is important to immediately start this process so that the timeline is met.  A failure to follow this requirement may result in the Division’s inability to claim certain funds in accordance with the Family First Prevention Services Act (FFPSA) (Public Law 115-123). Continued Review of the Placement As long as a child remains placed in a residential treatment setting, the Children’s Division or contracted agency shall submit evidence at each review and each permanency hearing held for the child.  Evidence shall include: Demonstrating that ongoing assessment of the strengths and needs of the child continues to support the determination that the needs of the child cannot be met through placement in a foster family home, that the placement in a residential setting provides the most effective and appropriate level of care for the child in the least restrictive environment and that the placement is consistent with the short- and long-term goals for the child, as specified in the Social Service Plan; Documenting the specific treatment or service needs that will be met for the child in the placement and length of time the child is expected to need the treatment or services; and Documenting the efforts made by the agency to prepare the child to return home or to be placed with a fit and willing relative, a legal guardian, or an adoptive parent, or in a foster family home. The Division shall ask the court at each review and each permanency hearing held to: Consider the assessment, determination, and documentation made by the qualified individual conducting the assessment; Determine whether placement of the child in a residential treatment setting continues to provide the most effective and appropriate level of care for the child, in the least restrictive environment; Determine whether that placement is consistent with the short-term and long term goals for the child, as specified in the permanency plan for the child; and Approve or disapprove the placement setting recommended by the Independent Assessor’s report. Such approval or disapproval must be documented in the case plan and uploaded to OnBase. In the event the court disapproves the placement, the Division shall seek placement in another setting, consistent with the findings of the Independent Assessor’s report. Note: DLS may provide support to the Division to accomplish these requirements. New Placement Actions for All Residential Settings As part of the residential placement process, the case manager shall proceed with placement by: Completing the residential admission packet and returning the information prior to admission; Arrange for adequate transportation of the child; Prepare the child and parent(s)/guardian(s) for placement, providing information about the facility, location, special programs, and visitation/contact arrangements, etc.; Inviting the parent(s)/guardian(s) to participate in the child’s admission process, if appropriate as determined by the case manager; Arriving at the placement with the child and participating in the intake process. Entering the child’s new placement information into FACES within 24 hours of placement. Entering a “Rehabilitation Service Begin Date” or an updated date on the Rehabilitation Services Tracking screen in FACES.  The Rehabilitation Service Begin Date must be the date the CSPI was completed or the date of placement, but may not be backdated to the date of placement unless the CSPI was completed on or before the placement date. Move and Discharge Requirements for All Residential Settings The residential facility shall begin planning the child’s discharge immediately upon entry into the residential facility. The residential facility shall make every effort to reduce or eliminate the number of unplanned discharges, emergency discharges, and moves to more restrictive settings for children placed in residential settings. If a child is being discharged on an unplanned/emergency basis or as the result of a 30-day notice for removal to another residential facility, the case manager shall follow the CS-9 referral process listed above. New Placement to Another Residential Treatment Setting If the child moves from a residential treatment placement to another residential treatment placement, the following steps shall be taken: The case manager shall begin the Starting the Residential Referral Process again, as outlined in this policy. A subsequent Independent Assessment shall be completed as outlined in the Independent Assessor’s Review section in the policy. All timeframes listed previously in this policy shall be followed. The case manager shall utilize the Residential Referral Tracking Sheet (CD-303). A transfer conference shall be held between the current provider and the next provider when a child moves from one residential treatment placement to another. The purpose of this conference is to share information about the child to aid in his/her transition to the next placement. This conference shall be arranged by the case manager and/or supervisor, with the current and subsequent placement provider, as well as the child (if developmentally appropriate). The RCST Coordinator may also attend the transfer conference, as necessary. The conference can be completed face-to-face or via conference call within the timeframes specified below: For a planned discharge, a transfer conference shall be held prior to a child’s move, but not to exceed the first five (5) calendar days of a child’s placement move. For an emergency discharge, a transfer conference shall occur during the Placement Stability Family Support Team Meeting (FSTM) within 72 hour hours of placement, or separately from the FSTM within the first five (5) calendar days of the placement change. Transfer meeting notes shall be documented in the contact communication log in FACES. Support from the Division of Legal Services DLS can assist with any motions or hearings as may be required by the court in order for a ruling by the court regarding the approval or disapproval of the Independent Assessor’s report within the timeframes of this policy.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/mo-section-4-chapter-2-placements-subsection-3-residential-rehabilitative-services-231
"MO :: Section 4, Chapter 2 (Placements), Subsection 3 – Residential Rehabilitative Services :: 2.3 – Residential and Department of Mental Health Developmental Disabilities Placements",Missouri,Rules,"2023, 2022, 2021","Group and residential care, Placement, Services while in care - Mental Health",,,"Placement in residential treatment or Department of Mental Health (DMH) Developmental Disabilities (DD) settings shall be the least restrictive placement settings to meet the specific needs of the child (an individual under twenty-one years of age, sometimes referred to as “youth”).  Group placement settings may also called “congregate care” or “institutional” settings.  It is important to explore and attempt lesser placement types prior to placement in a residential setting to the extent possible. This sub-section describes the process of referring a child in out-of-home care to a residential treatment program or a DMH placement.  If residential treatment or a DMH placement is determined to be in the best interest of the child, as discussed below, all treatment planning shall be tied to the child’s permanency plan, and discharge planning shall begin at the time of admission. Residential treatment may be appropriate for children with significant emotional and/or psychiatric needs, learning difficulties, behavioral disorders, trauma histories, and developmental disabilities or problems. Children suited for this type of placement are often unable to function adequately within the family, the school, or the community and are in need of additional support which cannot be reasonably met in a foster home setting. Regardless of the reason a child is in need of residential placement, the goal of all levels of treatment must be focused on stabilizing the child’s behaviors so that he/she may be able to return to the community and least restrictive placement. All children in the custody of the Children’s Division shall be placed in a facility that is licensed and contracted with the Division for residential treatment services, or licensed/certified by the DMH and contracted with on a case-by-case need. Residential treatment or DMH placements for a child under the age of seven (7) years shall only be considered once other resources have been explored.  However, certain behavior and/or physical conditions can exist which would indicate a need for a structured treatment setting for such a child.  In most instances, a foster home setting is preferable to another setting.  Residential treatment for children under seven (7) years of age shall be indicated as necessary through professional evaluations and recommendations by qualified professionals such as a child psychologist. Residential treatment and/or a DMH placement for a child under the age of seven (7) must be recommended by the Family Support Team (FST) after evaluations and recommendations by qualified professionals are completed and reviewed.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/mo-section-4-chapter-2-placements-subsection-3-residential-rehabilitative-services-23
"MO :: Section 4, Chapter 2 (Placements), Subsection 2 – Initial Placement Activities :: 2.2 Initial Placement Activities",Missouri,Rules,"2023, 2022, 2021","Administrative process, Placement, Safety, Services while in care - Medical",,,"Placement with a Resource Family (Foster or Relative) When a child enters the Division’s custody and needs placement with a resource family, the Children’s Service Worker will prepare the resource provider for placement, providing all available information about the child. The Children’s Service Worker shall provide to resource providers and potential adoptive parents prior to placement, all pertinent information including but not limited to, full disclosure of all medical, psychological, and psychiatric conditions of the child, as well as information from previous placements that would indicate that the child or children may have a propensity to cause violence to any member of the resource family home. The resource providers shall be provided with any information regarding the child or child’s family, including but not limited to the case plan, any family history of mental or physical illness, sexual abuse of the child or sexual abuse perpetrated by the child, criminal background of the child or the child’s family, fire-setting or other destructive behavior by the child, substance abuse by the child or child’s family, or any other information which is pertinent to the care and needs of the child and to protect the resource or adoptive family. The resource providers shall be given at time of placement full access to the child’s medical, psychological, and psychiatric records in its possession, including reports prior to the child coming into care; continued full access to all records that come into the possession of the division or of which the division becomes aware; access shall include providing information and authorization for the resource parent to review or to obtain the records directly from the medical, psychological, or psychiatric services provider; and resource parents may decline access to any or all of the child’s records. To prepare the child for placement, the Children’s Service Worker will provide the child with information about the resource family. The worker will help with the trauma of separation, reinforcing the belief that the child is not the cause of the family disruption. The child will also need help to understand the reasons the parents/caretakers cannot care for him/her. If age and developmentally appropriate, assure the child they will be directly involved in long-term planning and will be expected to maintain personal responsibility for their actions. All youth, at an age and developmentally appropriate level, should be informed of and given a copy of the Foster Care Bill of Rights. Youth, ages 14-21, shall receive a copy of “What’s It All About?” A Guidebook for Teens in Out-of-Home Care, and shall be referred to the Older Youth Program for Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) services. The book is intended to assist youth while in care and transitioning out of care.  The last page of the guidebook contains an acknowledgement form for the youth to sign. Documentation of a youth being provided the guidebook should also occur in the case narrative, in a FACES contact entry. The Children’s Service Worker shall arrange pre-placement visits, except in emergencies, per Section 210.566, RSMo. Any pre-placement visits must be discussed with the Family Support Team and the pre-placement provider.  The Family Support Team should review the Foster Family Profiles of potential resource providers in determining and selecting the most appropriate placement for the child. Decisions regarding the pre-placement visit plan and its details are on a case-by-case basis and are unique to the needs of the child. The licensed resource home of the pre-placement visit is not eligible for any payment for the child while on the visit, except allowable mileage reimbursement if applicable. Any exception must be pre-approved through supervisory channels with final approval by Central Office. After transporting the child to the resource family, the Children’s Service Worker will confirm or clarify any information previously shared. The worker will provide a copy of the court order placing the foster youth in CD custody. The resource provider shall be provided with a copy of subsequent court orders while the foster youth is placed in their home until the release of jurisdiction is signed by the judge. The worker will also provide full and accurate medical information (current conditions and history) to the resource provider at the time of placement, including information contained within the CW-103. If none or only part of the above is known, the case manager shall share what is available and continue obtaining needed information. If the child has tested HIV positive, provide complete information for caring for the child’s special medical needs and infection control (see below). The Children’s Service Worker should provide the following additional information at the time of placement: A copy of the Authorization to Provide Alternative Care form, CS-33 (if available). A MO HealthNet form and instructions for obtaining a complete health examination. Procedures for obtaining clothing for the child. The name and phone number of the child’s current school and instructions to enroll the child in a new school, if needed. The name and 24-hour contact telephone numbers of the worker and supervisor. The Universal Placement Letter which contains a link to the Foster Parent Bill of Rights and Responsibilities. Families who do not have access to the internet shall be provided a printed copy of the Foster Parent Bill of Rights and Responsibilities at their request. A full HCY examination including eye, hearing, and dental examinations should be completed no later than 30 days after the child is placed in Children’s Division custody. In addition, children should receive a developmental, mental health, and drug and alcohol screening within 30 days of the child’s entry into care. If needs are identified, these needs must be treated as soon as possible. If the Children’s Service Worker is unable to obtain the initial medical exam prior to placement, the initial medical examination shall occur, if possible, within 24 hours of the child coming into care. This initial health examination does not need to be a full Healthy Children and Youth (HCY) assessment. The purpose of the initial health examination is to identify the need for immediate medical or mental health care and assess for infectious and communicable diseases. When possible, this initial health examination should be completed by the child’s current primary care physician as they know the child and have knowledge of the child’s medical history. If a provider is not readily accessible, this exam must occur within 72 hours of the initial placement. Children, who enter CD custody should have continued follow up as needed following the initial examination. It is the Children’s Service Worker’s responsibility to ensure that children in CD custody receive the appropriate screening, assessment, and follow-up services as necessary. Children’s Division shall maintain best practices in monitoring the child’s health as required by federal and state laws, and as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Child Welfare League of America (CWLA), which set forth that certain medical appointments occur timely to assess and monitor the child’s health.   More information regarding medical exams can be found in Section 4, Chapter 4, Subsection 3 – Medical and Behavioral Health Planning. The medical examination should include an HIV screening (ELISA test) for children displaying symptoms of AIDS or AIDS Related Complex (ARC) or at high risk of HIV exposure. Children at risk of HIV infection include: Hemophiliacs or those children who received blood transfusions prior to 1985 Intravenous (IV) drug users Infants born to a mother who tests HIV positive Children with one or both parents who have tested HIV positive, have ARC, AIDS, or is at high risk for AIDS Sexually active youth who have had a sexual contact with a high-risk individual or an HIV infected individual Subjects of sexual abuse where the perpetrator is at high risk of AIDS or is an HIV infected individual The worker will utilize the team approach to determine the most appropriate resource family for a child who tests HIV positive. Team members should include: The child’s physician Public health personnel The child’s parent or caretaker Case manager The potential resource family provider, i.e., foster parent, adoptive parent, residential care provider The child (age 13 or older) Residential licensing representative, if appropriate The team may need to meet at regular intervals to assess the child’s health status and the appropriateness of the placement setting. A child placed in an out-of-home care setting has a right to privacy. This right is necessary to protect the child. Only those persons directly responsible for the child’s care or defined as a person with the need to know (see Sections 191.650 – 191.695 and 210.566, RSMo) should be informed of his/her condition. Report immediately any accidental injuries to a child in Children’s Division’s custody, and who is a MO HealthNet recipient, using procedures in the Income Maintenance Manual, Chapter VII. Placement of a Child in a Different Circuit If the Children’s Service Worker or the contracted agency place a child in a different circuit it is vital for the circuit to know so they can offer local services as needed and provide support to the family. If the child is placed in a different circuit the Children’s Service Worker or Supervisor must obtain permission from the licensing worker/contracted agency in the receiving county prior to placement. The Children’s Service Worker or Supervisor shall also ensure that the receiving circuit is notified of the placement by emailing the circuit’s courtesy email box within 24 hours of the placement. Circuit courtesy email box addresses can be found at the following link Courtesy Email Box Addresses . If the child is being placed with a relative, follow the policies in the Out of County Home Assessment located in Section 6, Chapter 9 . The Children’s Service Worker or Supervisor shall ensure the receiving circuit is notified of the relative placement by emailing the circuit’s courtesy email box within 24 hours of the placement. If the child is being placed after hours, and permission cannot be obtained, the Children’s Service Worker or Supervisor shall ensure that the receiving circuit is notified by emailing the circuit’s courtesy email box within 24 hours of placement. Placement in a Residential Setting When a child enters the Division’s custody and requires placement in a residential setting, the Children’s Service Worker will coordinate with the Residential Care Screening Team (RCST) Coordinator and the residential provider to coordinate the care and treatment.  Case management of children in residential placements require specific actions as further described in Section 4, Chapter 2 (Placements), Subsection 3 – Residential Rehabilitative Services.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/mo-section-4-chapter-2-placements-subsection-2-initial-placement-activities-22-initial-placement

The Children’s Division must conduct an immediate diligent search to contact, locate, and place with grandparents once the decision has been made to take custody during the first three (3) hours after placement. The statute requires staff to place with grandparents unless the decision to place with grandparents is contrary to the welfare of the child. The statute also requires staff to continue to make diligent efforts, while the child is in care, to contact, locate, and place the child with a grandparent or another relative, with first consideration given to a grandparent for placement. To make emergency placements with relatives or kin, follow the Purpose Code “X” screening process outlined in Section 6 of this manual. The status of a grandparent shall not be affected by the death or the dissolution of the marriage of a son or daughter. If the child is not placed with grandparents, the Children’s Service Worker must document in FACES why the child was not placed with grandparents. If no grandparents can be found, preference for placement must go to other relatives. The law also requires the Children’s Division to identify and notify all adult grandparents and other adult relatives (including adult siblings and parents of siblings) within 30 days when a child is removed from the custody of their parent(s). Some of these relatives may include: adult siblings, grandparents, aunts, uncles, great-grandparents, great aunts, great uncles, half-brother, half-sister, and first cousins. If relatives cannot be identified or found initially, the search for grandparents and other relatives should continue while the child is in care. These efforts should be documented in FACES. If more than one grandparent requests placement, the Family Support Team will make a recommendation to the court regarding placement. These statutes allow staff to contact grandparents and other relatives without a signed release of information form or permission from the parents. However, no protected health information about the parents should be disclosed.

"MO :: Section 3, Chapter 3 (Monitoring Plan), Subsection 4 – Crisis Intervention Funds :: 3.4 Crisis Intervention Funds",Missouri,Rules,"2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019","Administrative process, Definitions, Safety, Services while in care - Other",,,"Crisis Intervention Funds Crisis intervention funds allow the Division to address the critical financial and resource needs of families served by the Division. Crisis intervention funds are to be accessed when a family crisis is occurring which may result in child maltreatment.  Crisis intervention funds may be provided to: Have an open FCS case or be in the process of an investigation/assessment of a report of child maltreatment, and/or Have a child in out-of-home care and Have explored all other resources prior to the receipt of crisis intervention funds Crisis intervention funds are to be accessed when a family crisis is occurring which may result in child maltreatment.  In such situations the worker should immediately assess the safety in the home, through the use of the Immediate Safety Intervention Plan (CD-263). Crisis intervention funds were provided with the belief that some incidents of child maltreatment are directly related to a crisis event in a family’s life. These funds are to be accessed when there is a direct correlation between a crisis occurring and the potential for child maltreatment.  Crisis intervention funds are one tool staff may use to assist the family through a crisis and, at the same time, provide an opportunity for the family to learn how to handle a similar crisis in the future. Crisis intervention funds are not to be depended upon to remedy all family crises and are to be short-term and time-limited.  These funds are to be accessed only when a family’s resources to alleviate the crisis have been fully explored and crisis intervention funds are the last option. For purposes of the crisis intervention funds, the following definitions apply: “Crisis” is any event occurring within a family that is significant and in which there is a potential for child maltreatment as a result of that crisis “Crisis intervention funds” are those funds provided to purchase specific items family or family members need to alleviate that crisis “Fiscal agent” is a government entity that has contracted with the Division to maintain crisis intervention funds “County designee” is the person selected, in each county receiving crisis intervention funds, who is authorized to approve requests for funds. Role of Fiscal Agent, County Designee, and CD Staff Fiscal agents are responsible for maintaining the crisis intervention fund and working in cooperation with the Division. The fiscal agent will: Write checks upon request Sustain an audit trail and Provide invoices on a monthly basis to the county designee. Each agent will have available funds that can be disbursed immediately (during business hours) upon request. Fiscal agents may receive an administrative fee for the management of the fund. For each site that has access to crisis intervention funds, a county designee must be chosen. County designees will have the following responsibilities in managing these funds: Review all requests for crisis intervention funds from staff; Assure all required documentation is attached to the request; Approve by signature the request for funds; Maintain a log of funds requested, showing date of request, dollar amount, vendor chosen, worker name, case name, and head of household DCN; Maintain receipts from the purchase(s) made; and Review at the end of the month invoices received from the fiscal agent to “balance” the books. Within each office a plan must be established as to whom may perform these duties in the absence of the county designee. The staff who is assigned to the family is to: Determine if there is a direct correlation between the accessing of crisis intervention funds and the child’s safety in the home; Assess Child Safety. If the current crisis in the family presents a risk to the safety of the child (ren) in the home the worker will utilize the Immediate Safety Intervention Plan (CD-263) or the family assessment to determine if the conditions are “safe” or “unsafe” for the vulnerable child. If the conditions are “unsafe” crisis intervention funds may be an option in the development of immediate safety intervention plan; Be familiar with resources within the community of the family; Explore with the family all possible resources the family may have prior to the request for crisis intervention funds; Assist the family to establish a goal that will remedy the crisis they are facing and map the steps necessary to alleviate that crisis and enhance the caregiver’s capacity to be protective; Provide the guidance and information needed by the family to support them to complete their tasks. Tasks are considered to be educational to the family and applicable to future crises the family may face, they are not to be viewed as simply tasks the family must do to eliminate their crisis; Accompany a family when they are making their purchase, if the family needs this assistance; Obtain receipts from all purchases made with crisis intervention funds and submit them to the county designee for record-keeping purposes; and Complete all necessary forms to make the request for funds, documenting family’s resources and needs, maintaining required copies in the case file. Eligibility Any family having an open service case in a site that has crisis intervention funds and who is facing a crisis that may impact their ability to care for a child is eligible for the funds. Families must meet the following criteria: Have an open FCS case or be in the process of an investigation/assessment of a report of child maltreatment, and/or Have a child in out-of-home care and Have explored all other resources prior to the receipt of crisis intervention funds. A family is ineligible for crisis intervention if: If receiving crisis intervention funds over two (2) times within a six (6) month period, all other resources must have been exhausted and supervisory and/or administrative approval is required. If receiving over the maximum of $500 from the crisis intervention funds within the previous six (6) months supervisory and/or administrative approval is required. Eligible Services Home Repair: Minor home repairs may be paid for through crisis intervention funds. Examples are:  broken windows, plumbing problems, electrical problems, repairs of furnaces or water heaters, etc. Purchases within this category must be directly related to the risk of harm to the child if such a purchase is made. When purchasing a home repair, the family should perform as many of the duties involved in making this purchase as possible. Determining the specific repair needed, finding a reputable contractor, obtaining bids, and scheduling the repair are all activities the family can be supported to accomplish and addressed with a CPS-1 or the family assessment. The family should be directed to work within their community to choose a contractor. Specific guidance is to be given to the family regarding verification of reliability of the contractor. References, as well as the Better Business Bureau, may be resources to verify the reputation of a contractor. By directing them to work within their community, they are building a network for future reference. Child Safety Items: Safety items such as those listed below are not considered as crisis intervention tools, normally. However, having these items available or installed can prevent, or lessen the effects of a crisis. For example a fire does not have to occur for the need for smoke alarms to be installed. If a family has a child that requires a car seat, but does not have one, such an item may be purchased without a “crisis” occurring. Some possible safety items may be: Child-proofing electrical outlets; Special locks on doors; Telephone; Other items unique to the family’s need and the crisis they are facing; and Prior to the purchase of any safety item, thorough discussion needs to occur with the family members to determine their level of understanding regarding the need for such items. A family should understand the need for an item prior to a purchase being made. A discussion with the family will assess the strengths of the family, their reasoning ability, and their level of understanding of child safety. While a CPS-1 or family assessment may not reflect a sequence of events (a crisis may not be occurring prior to this request), staff can still, through the use of these tools, address the need for the item. (the child safety plan(s), activities to be undertaken designed to lead to an understanding of a child safety, etc.) An example of a family’s task would be to seek out resources, such as a local fire department or whether their landlord may provide smoke alarms for a household. Health Purchases: A family may have health needs that can be addressed through purchasing health items. Examples of possible uses of crisis intervention funds are: Immunizations Glasses Lice treatment Hearing aids Prescriptions First aid supplies Toothpaste/toothbrush Over-the-counter medications Humidifiers and Other items unique to the family’s need and the crisis they are facing. Staff should be sure the family has an identified plan regarding the use, safety, and storage of any items purchased for health needs. There may be resources available for particular health needs through the family’s community and the family may only need to know how to access them. If the family is unaware of the resources in the community, this is an opportunity for them to learn how to obtain particular items. For example, immunizations may be provided at low or no cost through the county health clinic. The treatment for head lice is sometimes provided free of charge through health departments or schools. Employment/School Supplies: Items needed to maintain employment or school attendance of a family member may be purchased with crisis intervention funds. Examples of such items would be: Uniforms for employment or school; Appropriate clothing for a child; Alarm clocks; School and employment supplies; and Other items unique to the need of the family in the crisis they are facing. In requesting funds to assist a family in maintaining employment or school attendance, it is extremely important for family members to explore with staff the reason(s) for maintaining them. Determination of self-sufficiency should be fully explored with the family and the ramifications of the family by the loss of employment or education should be fully evaluated by the family. Staff are to identify community resources available to meet the family’s needs when assisting the family in maintaining employment or schooling. Providing information on community resources (i.e., literacy programs, Futures, school-based programs) provides the family with information regarding their community and helps develop skills to access those resources. Household Items: Household items may be purchased for a family to improve the condition of their residence, when the home presents a health hazard to a child. Household items may include: Beds/bedding; Storage shelves/storage bins; Extermination; Utilities payments; Food; Major household appliances; and Other items unique to the family’s need and the crisis they are facing. Utility payments are to be paid with crisis intervention funds only when there is a risk of harm to a child due to lack of utilities. Understanding what resources are available within a community provides information to the family for future needs. Helping the family identify their needs and resources allows the family to develop skills and a network base, from which to work. Whenever possible, the family should be allowed to choose the items to be purchased. However, this selection should be with guidance from staff. Families should be encouraged to choose items that will be durable, dependable and economical. Remanufactured items (for appliances) are considered acceptable and such purchases should be encouraged if from a reputable vendor. Rent/Mortgage in Arrears: If a family is at imminent risk of losing a residence due to being in arrears in their rent or mortgage payment, a one-time access of crisis intervention funds may be considered. If a request is made to assist a family with rent/mortgage in arrears, every possible resource the family may have to obtain matching funds must be explored. No more than one (1) month’s payment may be provided for through crisis intervention funds. Community and family assistance must be sought prior to the request. Clear documentation must be provided as to what risk of maltreatment exists to a child if this payment does not occur. A completed assessment of the family reflecting what risk exists to a child must accompany any request for rent/mortgage arrears. If a child is at risk of placement due to a mortgage in arrears, crisis intervention funds may be accessed for up to the cost of one (1) month’s mortgage payment, not to exceed $500 without administrative approval. A specific plan of payment must accompany a request for funds for this reason. Planning would include negotiating with the lien holder to stop foreclosure actions, a payment plan for “catching up” the balance arrears, as well as a family budget. Transportation: Transportation may be provided to a family if a child is at risk of harm due to lack of available transportation. Transportation may be provided for: Employment; School; Medical appointments; Psychiatric/psychological testing; Counseling appointments; and Other appointments that a family may not be able to meet where failure to keep the appointment poses a risk of harm to a child. As transportation is often an ongoing challenge to families, problem solving is extremely important when requesting funds to provide transportation. The family will need to develop a network of resources to access transportation in the future. Understanding their community transportation systems and examining reliable resources through the use of ecomaps will help the family when faced with transportation problems in the future. Transportation may be purchased for a family through: Cab service; Bus passes; Auto repair ;and Gas purchase (including purchase of gas for a friend or relative who transports). When a family is purchasing auto repairs, they may purchase any repair that is required to maintain a vehicle in a safe manner. Routine maintenance of a vehicle would not be considered for crisis intervention funds. When purchasing vehicle repair for a family, the family is to select a vendor. The staff is to assist the family in making this decision by providing them with information regarding how to choose a reputable and dependable repair shop. Location/accessibility to the family, reasonable cost and dependability should be explored by the family when making this selection. Other Purchases: Other purchases not listed here but which are unique to the needs of a family and which may eliminate the risk of harm to a child may be possible through crisis intervention funds with appropriate administrative approval. Accessing Crisis Intervention Funds Assessment of Need: To access crisis intervention funds, the staff assigned to the family must explore with the family all other possible resources for the requested intervention. Areas such as extended family support, community resources, and negotiation or mediation between various parties need to be fully explored with the family prior to a request for crisis intervention funds. Documentation: To request crisis intervention funds, a Children’s Division (CD) Crisis Fund Authorization form (CS-81) must be completed and submitted to the designee. Attached to this form must be other required documentation, depending upon the program in which the family is currently involved.  Crisis intervention funds should be requested to pay for goods or services from a vendor which is selected by the family.  Due to financial concerns and the potential impact these funds may have on a family’s income, crisis intervention funds are to be made payable to a vendor rather than a family member, whenever this is possible. Documentation for the various cases should include: Investigation/Assessment – If the case is in the investigation/assessment phase, the CPS-1 narrative must reflect what resources the family has or does not have to remedy the current crisis they are facing. Specific information regarding what the need is and what resources were explored with the family before consideration was given to accessing crisis intervention funds must be documented. Strong consideration should be given to accessing of crisis intervention funds during this first 30 days of contact with the family. Appropriately assessing the immediate needs and resources of the family may prevent the opening of a case for Family-Centered Services.  Completion of the CPS-1 will be required to access crisis intervention funds, if they are conducting an initial family assessment or an investigation. Family-Centered Services – If the family is receiving Family-Centered Services, documentation of the need for crisis intervention funds is to be part of the assessment and treatment needs. In conjunction with exploring with the family what resources they have to alleviate the crisis they are facing, planning needs to occur as to what they will do if they face a similar crisis in the future. As part of this exploration and planning, the Family Safety Planning Document (CD-267) may be used to address future events.  A crisis is a time for change and education for a family. Family-Centered Out-of-Home Care Services – Like Family-Centered Services, crisis intervention funds must be tied to the completion of the assessment. In addition to other program options, this fund may be accessed for a family that is working on reunification, but has experienced a crisis that may prevent reunification from occurring in an expedient manner. Payment Process: Payments for crisis intervention funds will be made through Family And Children’s Electronic System (FACES) on a Payment Request. Crisis intervention fund payments include reimbursement to the fiscal agent after they have expended funds and an administrative fee is paid to the fiscal agent for maintaining the crisis intervention funds.  All Payment Requests for crisis intervention funds must be sent to the FACES Payment Unit.  The CS-81 or IIS Referral must be attached and documentation must be completed in its entirety. The explanation provided on the documentation must state how the purchase relates to the risk of the child.  The invoice or verification of purchase must be attached. Copies of payment documentation including invoice/receipts must be retained in the case file.",https://fostercaresystems.wustl.edu/foster/mo-section-3-chapter-3-monitoring-plan-subsection-4-crisis-intervention-funds-34-crisis
"MO :: Section 3, Chapter 3 (Monitoring Plan), Subsection 1 – Providing Services – Home Visit Requirements :: 3.1 Providing Services- Home Visit Requirements",Missouri,Rules,"2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019",Services while in care - Other,,,"Minimum Contact Standard for FCS Cases Supervisor discretion will be used to determine the number of Home Visits and Safety Network Contacts are needed for FCS cases. The number should be based on the needs of the family.  This may be one HV per week or just weekly contact with the family through (in person, phone, collateral, etc.).  At a minimum, one face to face home visit per month must be completed on all FCS cases. It is important to meet with all family members to adequately assess risk and safety, being especially important to see all the children.  Consult with a supervisor if any of the children are unavailable at the time of the home visits.  A plan should be made to assure the children are safe. Providing Services Staff may provide services based on the family needs. Examples of direct services that the worker may need to provide are: Teaching the family behavioral techniques for changing undesirable behaviors. An example of this would be introducing the parents to behavior modification methods such as positive reinforcement and “time-out,” rather than physical punishment; Teaching the family appropriate methods to channel frustrations and manage anger; Modeling effective family communication and structuring family activities to enhance communication and family functioning; Engaging the family in the treatment process; Teaching life skills, such as how to improve self-esteem and how to look for employment; Teaching and role modeling household management skills, such as house cleaning, budgeting, and cooking; Providing “hard services” to meet basic needs of the family, such as securing food, shelter, and transportation; Developing resources and making these resources available to the family for their ongoing support. Encouraging and working with parents to be cooperative and engaging of the non-custodial or non-resident parent as appropriate in preserving the best interest and safety of the child/ren;and Referring the family to any available culturally-relevant community resources that help them meet basic needs and stabilize their family, including: Housing referral and assistance; Public benefits and income support, including any assistance needed to obtain food, clothing, and utility services; Child care; Home care and support services, including household management and home health aide services; Medical and dental care; Respite care; Transportation services; and Vocational and educational assistance. Providing Services for Children Receiving In-Home Services Children who are at home with their families should receive individualized services that promote positive development and address any effects of maltreatment. Children should be connected to services that address any identified needs they may have for: Medical and dental care; Mental health care; Substance use treatment; Educational services; Services to increase well-being; and Specialized services and supports for children with special needs. Providing Services through Referrals Staff should utilize all available community resources to help the family. This may require the use of purchased services. See Section 8 Chapter 7 for additional information on contracted services. Intensive In Home Services (IIS) An IIS referral is required in all cases when staff plan to recommend removal of a child(ren).  Intensive In-Home Services (IIS) is a short-term, intensive, home-based, crisis intervention program that combines skill-based interventions with maximum flexibility so that services will be available to families according to their individual needs.  The goal of IIS is to offer families in crisis the alternative of remaining together safely, averting out-of-home placement of children whenever possible.  IIS are, however, offered solely to families that have a child or children at imminent risk of removal from the home due to neglect, abuse, family violence, mental illness, delinquency, or other circumstances.  Services provided assist with crisis management and restoration of the family to an acceptable level of functioning. Referrals for IIS originate from many sources. While the majority of referrals come from Children’s Division (CD), others may come from Department of Mental Health, Division of Youth Services, juvenile office, and other community resources such as practitioners, hospitals, and schools.  Self-referrals are also received from families experiencing a crisis.  Staff are responsible for assessing the appropriateness of referrals for IIS if recommendation has been made for out-of-home placement of children.  When it has been determined that IIS is the most appropriate service for a family (in those circumstances) the family is referred for services. All families referred for IIS are received on first-come, first-serve basis. Families are not accepted for IIS services when families do not meet the referral criteria or in instances where specialists have no available openings.  Waiting lists are not maintained for IIS referrals based on the rationale that responding to an immediate crisis cannot be postponed to a later date.  When a family is not accepted into IIS, out-of-home placement may occur. Local Collaboration Plans with Head Start Agencies The Children’s Division is committed to working with local Head Starts in providing services to Protective Services children. The Children’s Division Circuit Manager will develop a local collaboration plan with their local Head Start Director, which includes Head Start and Early Head Start programs.  The Local Collaboration Plan, CD-199, is designed to provide a framework for local Children’s Division and Head Start agencies to improve the coordination of services for the children and families served by both agencies.  The Circuit Manager is to complete the CD-199, with the local Head Start Director no less than every two years, or as needed and as agreed upon by both agencies.  A copy of the completed CD-199 is to be shared with the local Head Start and submitted to the Children’s Division, Early Childhood and Prevention Services Section via email at CD.AskECPS@dss.mo.gov . Referral to Head Start and Early Head Start Programs The Children’s Division case manager is encouraged to refer children and families, who may be eligible, to their local Head Start agency by completing the Head Start/Early Head Start Referral Form (CD-200).  While children in foster care are categorically eligible for HS/EHS programs, a referral does not guarantee placement.   A referral to HS/EHS does not preclude families from choosing a child care provider of their choice. Home Visiting Home Visiting is an in-home service designed to assist with the prevention of child abuse and neglect by offering additional in-home support for at-risk families. The Home Visiting Program is a voluntary program providing assistance to eligible parents whose family income does not exceed 185% of the federal poverty level, and are currently pregnant or have a child under the age of 3 years. The program provides parents various opportunities to gain skills in the areas of child abuse and neglect prevention, early childhood development and education, parenting skill development, and school readiness.  The Home Visiting program also provides parents with hands-on training and educational support groups, developmentally appropriate books and toys for the children, as well as various incentives for the parents to keep them engaged in the program.  As the child(ren) age out of the Home Visiting program, they are referred to a Head Start or another early learning program to maintain continuity of educational services for the family. 70% of the families enrolled in Home Visiting must be referred by Children’s Division. This can include families that come to the attention of CD by means of a newborn crisis assessment, investigation or family assessment, in addition to ongoing FCS cases and AC cases with an active plan for reunification. The Home Visiting providers are required to develop, or participate in, a multi-disciplinarian team in their assigned region as a means of providing wrap-around services for the families served and to create networks of referral sources for our families. Each program is developed to include incentives for the families. Some of these incentives include, but are not limited to, diapers/wipes, formula, educational toys and books, gift cards or “cash” for needed items such as clothes and formula with mechanisms to ensure that only eligible items are purchased, gas cards, and or cribs and car seats. Each HV provider offers different incentives and supports which is why it is so important to build these relationships early and to collaborate with the providers in your area. Some additional supports provided by Home Visitors for CD staff include:  attending FST meetings, attending court hearings,  attending TDM meetings, aiding in safe reunification of children with their families, and continuing in-home supports for families well after CD cases close.

Were the required number of caregivers on duty? Where were the caregivers? How long were the children left alone (if applicable)? Were there any injuries? Are there any prior CA/N reports? Corporal punishment that leaves no injuries may be a licensing violation. Not having the appropriate number of staff on duty is not necessarily lack of supervision for CA/N, although it is a licensing violation.

The sleeping quarters of the residents can be some distance from the staff’s room making it difficult to hear a disturbance or a child crying out for help.  Good practice requires staff to make tours of all resident rooms during the night. Design and layout not only includes an awareness of physical location of rooms, but also includes accessibility to either staff or phones when an emergency exists.  When observing the location where the incident was to have occurred, the worker should look at where telephones are located and should determine how far away was another staff person, who could have been able to assist other staff or children.
